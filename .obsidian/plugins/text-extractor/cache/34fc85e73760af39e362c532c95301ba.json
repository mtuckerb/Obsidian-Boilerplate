It is the sole responsibility of the end user to ensure that the installation, operation, and maintenance of this product comply with all applicable local, state, and national electrical and safety regulations. By using this product, you acknowledge that it is supplied \"as is\" and that you assume full responsibility for any risks associated with its use. The supplier of this PCB assumes no liability for any damage, injury, or loss of any kind, whether direct or indirect, resulting from the use, misuse, or inability to use the hardware, software, or associated components provided. It is strongly recommended that users seek professional advice and services to ensure compliance with relevant safety standards and to avoid potential hazards. Wiring information: Keep wire length to a minimum: Plan the mounting position of the PCB in a location that reduces the cable length to the various sensors you plan on using. Longer cables can reduce the signal quality from various sensors. Use shielded cable: It’s good practice to use shielded cable between the sensors and PCB. This reduces electrical interference that can impact the quality of the signal. The outer shielding of the cable should be connected to any of the GND terminals on the PCB. Note: Only connect one end of the shielding to GND Display cable: The OLED display connections (SDA and SCL) are particularly sensitive to electrical interference. It is vital to use shielded cable with one end of the shielding connected to any GND on the PCB. It is recommended to keep the cable length to a minimum (max recommended length is 400mm). Inductive loads INFO: For inductive loads such as solenoid valves, vibration pumps and mechanical relays. It is recommended to install an appropriately rated Metal Oxide Varistor across the terminals of the appliance, as shown in the example below. The purpose of the varistor is to absorb the voltage spikes from the appliance when power is turned off. This protects the onboard solid-state relays from voltage spikes. While they are not strictly required, if you experience a “sticky relay” which means once the solid-state relay turns on, it stays on even when not required. This is due to the inductive voltage spike preventing the Zero- crossing detector from switching off the solid-state relay. For 220~240VAC mains power: We recommend a Metal Oxide Varistor with the following specs: Maximum AC Volts: 275VAC Current – Surge: 2.5 ~ 4 kA A common choice for this application is the 10D431K model of varistor. For 100~120VAC mains power: We recommend a Metal Oxide Varistor with the following specs: Maximum AC Volts: 175VAC Current – Surge: 2.5 ~ 4 kA A common choice for this application is the 10D271K model of varistor. PCB Overview DC Power NOTE: The onboard 5V PSU has a maximum current output of 2A. This is more than sufficient to operate the PCB and all the sensors connected. However, if you connect additional accessories to the 5V supply, ensure that you are not exceeding the 2Amp current limit of the PSU. 100 ~ 240VAC Input and Relay Outputs Note: For inductive loads such as mechanical relays, solenoid valves. Etc, it may be necessary to install a metal oxide varistor to reduce inductive kickback which can prevent the on board zero-crossing solid state relays from turning off.

It is vital to use shielded cable with one end of the shielding connected to any GND on the PCB. It is recommended to keep the cable length to a minimum (max recommended length is 400mm). Flow Meters Single flow meter setup A single high-pressure rated flow meter is the easiest configuration to calibrate. The flow meter should be installed in a location close to the group head, and after any pressure regulators. Pros: Easy to calibrate and accurate. Cons: high pressure flow meters are expensive. Dual flow meter setup In a dual flow meter configuration, FM1 measures the volume of water going to the pump. Any water that is bleed off by pressure regulators is measured by FM2 before being returned to the tank. Pros: Low pressure flow meters are cheaper. Cons: Difficult to calibrate and achieve accurate results.
