The author concludes that the best way to influence kids to eat more healthy food is to display an overweight influencer promoting unhealthy food. The author points to the correlation between the foods promoted (heathy vs unhealthy) and the \"influencer's\" body type (thin-ideal vs overweight) and the participants' choices and infers causality. While the study does separately measure credibility and food choice, it does not prove that there is a causal relationship between the two. The article asserts that the participant's food choice was affected by the influencers who presented the food. In fact, our textbook \"Social Psychology\" affirms that more attractive (e.g. thin-ideal) messengers will be more persuasive when the message isn't personally important to the people hearing it, or when they don't have much knowledge in the domain. In this case it is safe to assume that children have a strong pre-existing preference for healthy food consequentially peripheral-route persuasion will have less impact. The research confirms this. \"First and in general, the tweens chose more for the unhealthy snack, independent of whether they were exposed to unhealthy vs. healthy food placements in Instagram posts. This is in line with previous research among children and adolescents (Folkvord et al., 2013; Naderer et al., 2018) and can be explained by the inherent human preference for sweets and snacks\" (Desor et al., 1973; Harris et al., 1990 as cited in (De Jans, et. al., 2022). Rather than conclude that tweens find overweight influencers \"less credible,\" a more reasonable conclusion that remains aligned with the corpus of social psychology is that tweens were confronted by a negative outcome (obesity) which was associated with the unhealthy food choice. This is confirmed by the findings, \"recent studies showcase that the belief that obesity is connected to unhealthy eating habits is already established in children’s reasoning to explain obesity\" (Tiggemann and Anesbury, 2000; Gonçalves et al., 2012 as cited in De Jans, et. al., 2022). These findings are almost certainly culturally situated. In cultures where \"thin-ideal\" bodies are not the idea, or in cultures not as significantly affected by western advertisement and the body standards that they reinforce, different results could be expected. Also, one might expect interdependent cultures to be more strongly motivated by the negative association of unhealthy food with an overweight person, as our textbook pointed out \"East Asians are more inclined to pursue their goals with a prevention orientation, focusing on the negative outcomes they hope to avoid\" (De Jans, et. al., 2022). It is also worth noting that both women and Eastern culturally situated people are more likely to attribute outcomes to a situation than to a trait. (Gilovich, et. al, 2024) In the case of subconsciously correlating unhealthy food choices to overweight bodies, this could result in a more coincidental attribution in Eastern cultures and females as opposed to a character/trait attribution by Westerners and men. In conclusion, this research and the PsyPost article that followed raise more questions than they answer for me. I would love to see cross cultural studies in which more nuanced measure were taken (specifically a stronger focus on relevance to the age group being studied), and where more factors were cross-correlated (e.g. gender, culture, self-concept).
