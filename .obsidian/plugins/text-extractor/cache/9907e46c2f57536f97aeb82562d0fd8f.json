If you have MaineCare, TANF, PaS, or HOPE - Tell us within 10 days from the date that: • There are changes in income or assets for anyone in your home; • There are changes in where you live, your mailing address, or your shelter costs; • Someone in your household starts or stops school or training; or • Anyone moves into or out of your home. • If someone in your home gets a lump sum payment of any kind (like an inheritance, a settlement, retroactive benefits, etc.), talk with an eligibility worker right away. Do not spend any of the money until you contact us. The toll-free phone number is on the first page of this notice. For TANF, PaS, and HOPE only - If your minor child will be out of your home for 45 days or more, you need to tell us within 5 days from when it becomes clear this will happen. If you have SNAP - You must tell us by the 10th day of the month after the month one of the following occurs (these are the only changes you will need to report for the SNAP Program): • For able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs), changes in work that cause your hours to drop below 20 hours per week; • Someone in your household wins $4,500 or more in a lottery or other gambling game; • Your household income exceeds the gross monthly income limit for your household size shown in the chart below.

Regardless of changes, you will need to complete and return this form, or benefits will be denied. Your Right to a Hearing What can I do if I disagree with a decision about my benefits? If you disagree with a decision that affects your benefits, you may have the right to an administrative hearing. You can ask for an appeal by calling the toll-free number listed on this notice, or by coming into your local office and talking to an eligibility worker. You may also ask for a hearing by writing a letter to the Commissioner of DHHS. The address is 11 SHS, Augusta, ME 04333. For HOPE - If you disagree with a decision that affects your benefits, you have the right to an informal review upon request directly to the HOPE Program before asking for an administrative hearing. You have 10 days from the date of this notice to contact HOPE directly and ask for an informal review. This may help to resolve the issue. Asking for an informal review with HOPE will not impact your right to an administrative hearing. You do not have to ask for an informal review with HOPE to ask for a hearing. Who else can be at the hearing with me? You may bring anyone you choose to the hearing. If you want someone to represent you at the hearing or attend it instead of you, DHHS has to have paperwork on file telling us that ahead of time. If you have not given us that paperwork already, ask an eligibility worker for the Department's \"Authorized Representative\" form and the \"Authorization to Release Information\" form. See below for information on free legal services that might be able to help you with the hearing. What is the deadline to ask for a hearing? MaineCare, TANF, PaS and HOPE - you have 30 days from the date of this notice to ask for a hearing. For HOPE only - If you ask for an informal review with HOPE, you have 30 days from the date of the notice of the HOPE Program's review decision to ask for a hearing. 4 SNAP - you have 90 days from the date of this notice to ask for a hearing. Can I still get benefits while waiting for a hearing decision? Yes. If you want to keep your benefits from being cut or stopped during the hearing process: • For TANF and PaS - you have 10 days from this notice to ask for a hearing. Your benefits will stay open, unless you tell us you don't want them to. • For SNAP - you have 12 days from this notice to ask for a hearing. Your benefits will stay open, unless you tell us you don't want them to. • For MaineCare - you have 15 days from this notice to ask for a hearing. Your benefits will close, unless you tell us you want to keep them open. • For HOPE - you have 30 days from this notice to ask for a hearing. If the request is received within 10 days of this notice services will continue pending the outcome. If you miss the deadline, DHHS may still let you appeal and keep your benefits in place during the appeal. But you must have \"good cause\" for missing the deadline. Tell DHHS right away if you think you have good cause. What else do I need to know about keeping benefits open? Your benefits will stay as is until your hearing is held and a decision is made. If your current enrollment period ends before a decision is made, your benefits will be stopped at that time. If you are appealing the denial of an extension to the 60-month lifetime limit on TANF or PaS, your benefits will not continue during the appeal period. If you lose the hearing, you must pay back any benefits you received during the appeal process that you were not eligible for. This recoupment does not apply to MaineCare. Fraud Why do I need to make sure my information is correct and up to date? You must provide DHHS with complete and accurate information. Please be aware that DHHS will check the information that you give. If you know you gave us incorrect information or you know that you get benefits (for example, SNAP, TANF, PaS, MaineCare, HOPE) that you are not eligible for, then you may be prosecuted for fraud.

Programs that receive federal financial assistance from the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and programs HHS directly operates are also prohibited from discrimination under federal civil rights laws and HHS regulations. Persons with disabilities who require alternative means of communication for program information (e.g., Braille, large print, audiotape, American Sign Language), should contact the agency (state or local) where they applied for benefits. Individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing or who have speech disabilities may contact USDA through the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339. Additionally, program information may be made available in languages other than English. CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINTS INVOLVING USDA PROGRAMS USDA provides federal financial assistance for many food security and hunger reduction programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) and others. To file a program complaint of discrimination, complete the Program Discrimination Complaint Form, (AD-3027) (found online at: How to File a Complaint, and at any USDA office) or write a letter addressed to USDA and provide in the letter all of the information requested in the form.

CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINTS INVOLVING HHS PROGRAMS HHS provides federal financial assistance for many programs to enhance health and well-being, including TANF, Head Start, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and others. If you believe that you have been discriminated against because of your race, color, national origin, disability, age, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity), or religion in programs or activities that HHS directly operates or to which HHS provides federal financial assistance, you may file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) for yourself or for someone else. To file a complaint of discrimination for yourself or someone else regarding a program receiving federal financial assistance through HHS, complete the form on line through OCR's Complaint Portal at https://ocrportal.hhs. gov/ocr/.
