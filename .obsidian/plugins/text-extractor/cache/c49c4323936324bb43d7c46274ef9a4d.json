{"path":"2025/02/11/25-26-appeal-worksheet.pdf","text":"Brandeis University 2025-2026 Financial Aid Appeal Worksheet Instructions Your eligibility for need-based financial aid has been determined according to federal regulations and university policies governing financial aid programs. Using the information that you provided on the FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE, student and parent tax returns* and/or other supporting documentation, we have calculated your Student Aid Index (SAI) and awarded financial aid appropriately. We recognize that a family’s income is not always consistent and that financial situations change throughout the academic year due to unforeseen circumstances. You may request a review of your financial aid package to significant changes in your family’s circumstances that affect your ability to contribute to college costs by completing this Financial Aid Appeal Worksheet and submitting the required documentation. Please complete all sections of this form as accurately as possible. If you have not already submitted a 2025-2026 FAFSA, 2025-2026 CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE, complete copies of the student’s and parents’ 2023 Federal Tax Returns* and a 2025-2026 Verification Worksheet, if required, you must do so now. To ensure consideration for the academic year starting in August, Early Decision students must submit appeals by March 1 and Regular Decision students by April 15. There is no specific deadline for returning students, but please note that we will begin addressing appeals from continuing students after July 15th, 2025. Appeals are considered on a first come, first served basis so it is in your best interest to submit a request for reconsideration as early as possible. Again, information presented in this appeal should be new information or information that has changed significantly from your initial application. We cannot consider appeals based on credit card debt, car or mortgage payments, wedding/celebration expenses, private school costs, vacations or other discretionary expenses. Please note that submission of an appeal does not grant an extension of the bill due date. All student accounts must be paid in full by the stated due dates even if an appeal is in process. If you have any questions regarding the appeal process, or would like to discuss payment plans, private loans or other bill payment options while waiting on an appeal response, please contact us at (781) 736-3700 or finaid@brandeis.edu. Once the Student Financial Services Appeals Committee reviews the submitted documentation and determines if the student qualifies for additional aid, we will notify the student by mail. Response time will vary based on our volume of appeals at the time you submit your request. However, you can expect a status update within 5 – 10 business days. Additional aid will be considered for students on a funds available basis when the calculations result in higher financial need. Please note, additional scholarship funds will only be offered if a student has taken advantage of all other sources of financial aid (e.g., federal and state grants, subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans, etc.).
