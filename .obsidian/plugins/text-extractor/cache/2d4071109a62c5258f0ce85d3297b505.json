If you have an agreement with DHHS to pay a certain amount of child support toward a back debt, you must tell DHHS you are receiving unemployment benefits if you want withholding toward the back debt limited to that amount. Also, if you are currently receiving TANF or SSI for your child, you may be exempt from automatic withholding. If you think you may be exempt or have questions about the amount that will be deducted from your unemployment benefits , please contact your DHHS support enforcement agent and discuss your concerns. APPEAL RIGHTS: If you disagree with how the agent responds to your complaint, you may request an administrative hearing. At the hearing you will have an opportunity to provide further information. The hearing officer will issue a decision in writing. If you disagree with that decision, you have the right to appeal to court.
