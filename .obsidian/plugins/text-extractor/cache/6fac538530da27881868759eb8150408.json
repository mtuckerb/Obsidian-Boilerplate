In particular, we investigated whether tweens’ healthy food choice behavior can be stimulated by using a thin-ideal inﬂuencer in a sponsored inﬂuencer post promoting unhealthy vs. healthy food. A two-by- two, between-subjects experimental study (inﬂuencer weight: thin-ideal vs. overweight; snack-type: unhealthy vs. healthy) was conducted with 146 tweens (11–13 years old, 73 boys). Results show that tweens’ choice for a healthy snack was higher when a (female) overweight inﬂuencer promoted an unhealthy snack (compared to a healthy snack). Using a thin-ideal inﬂuencer promoting an unhealthy vs. healthy snack did not affect tweens’ healthy food choices. While there were no interaction effects of inﬂuencer weight and snack type on source effects (inﬂuencer credibility, inﬂuencer admiration, and trans-parasocial interactions), the results did show that the inﬂuencer was perceived as less credible and was admired less when she was overweight vs. when she had a thin-ideal body-type. Keywords: Inﬂuencer marketing, food marketing, healthy eating behavior, tweens, thin-ideals INTRODUCTION As food preferences start to develop early in life, food marketers heavily target children, tweens, and teens (Tan et al., 2018), whereby they are exposed to a great number of food advertisements on diﬀerent media. To break through the advertising clutter, new tactics emerge to attract children’s and adolescents’ attention and impact on their food preferences and choices. Especially the popularity of social media gave rise to new platforms and formats to endorse food products to the young audience. One of those new advertising formats is inﬂuencer marketing, which refers to social media inﬂuencers promoting brands or products on their social media proﬁles in return for compensation (Hudders et al., 2021). Inﬂuencer marketing has been shown to heavily target children (De Veirman et al., 2019). Recent content analyses show that much of the foods that are endorsed on social media are non-core foods or unhealthy foods (Tan et al., 2018; Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 789069 fpsyg-13-789069 April 2, 2022 Time: 14:2 # 2 De Jans et al. Thin-Ideals in Inﬂuencer Posts Coates et al., 2019a). Using a diary study where adolescents had to capture their exposure to food marketing messages on social media, Qutteina et al. (2019) showcased that adolescents were mainly exposed to non-core foods in oversized portions on social media. This raises concerns as young audiences are less successful in resisting food marketing temptations compared to adults, as their knowledge and skills to critically reﬂect on those marketing attempts, referred to as persuasion knowledge (Friestad and Wright, 1994), are still developing. They also often lack the motivation to resist such attempts (Harris et al., 2009; Hudders et al., 2017). Moreover, children’s liking of food products is also largely determined by their familiarity with food (Cooke, 2007). Accordingly, food marketing, mainly showing unhealthy food products, is one of the factors that might contribute to childhood obesity (Folkvord et al., 2016), which is considered as one of the most serious global public health challenges of the 21st century. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that 39 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight or obese in 2020 and over 340 million minors between 5 and 19 years were overweight or obese in 2016 (WHO, 2020). Childhood obesity poses both physical and psychological health risks, that can occur both immediately and in the future (Sahoo and Garg, 2012). Thus, children need to adopt a healthy diet. Children’s and adolescents’ perceived beneﬁts of healthy eating are improvement of cognitive and physical performance, ﬁtness, endurance, psychological beneﬁts, feeling good physically, and the production of energy (O’dea, 2003). Recently, children and adolescents are also increasingly exposed to healthy foods and behaviors on social media, such as inﬂuencers promoting veganism (Schmuck, 2021), ﬁtspiration (i.e., images and text promoting health and ﬁtness), and thinspiration (i.e., images and text promoting thinness) (Alberga et al., 2018). However, extant research has mainly examined how inﬂuencer marketing promoting unhealthy foods aﬀects children’s and adolescents’ food choice behavior and has shown that inﬂuencer marketing is eﬀective in promoting unhealthy foods and increasing caloric intake among children (Coates et al., 2019b; Smit et al., 2019). Although children and adolescents are also increasingly exposed to healthy content on social media, there is hardly any research on how inﬂuencer marketing can be used to promote healthy foods to this target group (Folkvord and Hermans, 2020; De Jans et al., 2021). Limited prior studies revealed that mere exposure to inﬂuencer marketing for healthy foods does not increase children’s and adolescents’ choice of healthy foods (Coates et al., 2019a; Folkvord and de Bruijne, 2020). Recently, De Jans et al. (2021) did show that an inﬂuencer’s lifestyle (sedentary vs. athletic) aﬀects children’s choice for healthy food, indicating that inﬂuencers’ characteristics can have an impact on how receptive children are to promoted food options. Therefore, by examining the impact of the weight of the social media inﬂuencer (thin-ideal vs. overweight), the current study investigated another personal characteristic of an inﬂuencer promoting healthy vs. unhealthy foods on tweens’ (i.e., young people between 10 and 13 years of age; Enochsson, 2007; McArthur et al., 2021) choice for healthy foods. Thus, this study aims to examine how social media inﬂuencers can be used to endorse healthy (vs. unhealthy) foods to tweens. In particular, the current study investigates whether a social media inﬂuencer’s physical characteristics (i.e., inﬂuencer weight) can aﬀect tweens’ food choice behavior. How an inﬂuencer’s weight and the promoted snack-type (healthy vs. unhealthy) aﬀect the evaluation of the inﬂuencer (i.e., source eﬀects) is also examined. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK How Children and Adolescents Are Persuaded by Inﬂuencer Marketing for Unhealthy Foods Previous research has already examined how inﬂuencer marketing promoting unhealthy foods can have an impact on children’s and adolescents’ food choices. Although children and adolescents themselves believe that they can resist inﬂuencer marketing promoting unhealthy foods (Coates et al., 2020), research univocally shows that inﬂuencer marketing for unhealthy foods aﬀects their unhealthy food preferences, choices, and intake. For example, Coates et al. (2019b) showed that exposure to inﬂuencer marketing on YouTube promoting an unhealthy snack (with and without an advertising disclosure, i.e., a label signaling the presence of advertising) resulted in children (9–11 years) consuming more of the advertised snack compared to the alternative snack, while there was no diﬀerence between the consumption of the advertised and alternative snacks in the control condition (no food marketing). Using longitudinal survey data, Smit et al. (2019) found that the frequency of watching vlogs of social media inﬂuencers increases the consumption of unhealthy beverages (but not the consumption of unhealthy snacks) among children and tweens between 8 and 12 years. In addition, a study by Coates et al. (2019a), examining inﬂuencer marketing on Instagram, showed that children’s (9–11 years) overall caloric intake and their intake of unhealthy snacks increased after viewing inﬂuencer marketing promoting unhealthy snacks compared to the control condition where non-food products were promoted. The persuasive impact of food marketing for unhealthy foods can be explained by the Reactivity to Embedded Food Cues in Advertising Model (REFCAM) (Folkvord et al., 2016). The REFCAM puts forward a two-step process of food advertising. First, physiological and psychological reactions (such as the activation of a central appetitive state) to unhealthy foods are induced through food cues in food advertising (a process referred to as the advertising eﬀect process). These reactions subsequently lead to a reciprocal relationship with unhealthy eating behavior (which is labeled as the incentive-sensitization process) (Folkvord et al., 2016). In addition, the model proposes that children’s and adolescents’ susceptibility to food advertising is not only determined by their dispositional factors (such as weight and impulsivity), but that also message factors (such as the media context in which the advertising is integrated) moderate the eﬀect of food advertising for unhealthy foods (Folkvord et al., 2016).

Thin-Ideals in Inﬂuencer Posts Inﬂuencer marketing is an embedded advertising format, as these sponsored posts have the same layout and design as the other entertaining, non-sponsored posts of the social media inﬂuencers (De Jans and Hudders, 2020). This makes it diﬃcult for viewers of these posts to recognize the sponsored posts as advertising and activate critical reﬂections toward the food advertising, which increases the food advertising’s eﬀectiveness (Folkvord et al., 2016). This is especially challenging for children and adolescents, as their persuasion knowledge is not yet matured, making them even more susceptible to food advertising for unhealthy foods (Hudders et al., 2021). Using Social Media Inﬂuencers to Promote Healthy Food Choice Behavior Due to the ﬁndings that inﬂuencer marketing is eﬀective in promoting unhealthy foods, researchers started investigating whether this marketing tactic can also be used to promote healthy nutrition. These results are, however, not so univocal. Prior research shows that merely exposing children and adolescents to inﬂuencer marketing promoting healthy foods does not aﬀect their healthy food choice behavior. For instance, besides showing that inﬂuencer marketing on Instagram promoting unhealthy foods increases children’s intake of unhealthy snacks, the study of Coates et al. (2019a) also showed that inﬂuencer marketing promoting healthy foods did not aﬀect children’s (9–11 years) food intake. In line with this, Folkvord and de Bruijne (2020) found that the promotion of vegetables in inﬂuencer posts on Instagram did not aﬀect adolescents’ (13–16 years) intake of vegetables (compared to a condition where an unhealthy snack was promoted and a control condition where no food product was promoted). In line with the REFCAM (Folkvord et al., 2016), Folkvord (2019) proposed the Healthy Food Promotion Model explaining the eﬀectiveness of advertising promoting healthy food behavior. First, the model suggests that through the promotion of healthy food consumers’ attention toward the value of healthy foods will be increased, which will lead to a reciprocal relationship with dietary intake. This will subsequently lead to an enhanced intake of healthy foods and therefore a habit formation concerning the intake of healthy foods. Finally, this habit of eating healthy foods for longer periods will eventually result in improved health states (Folkvord, 2019). However, as extant research shows that the mere exposure to inﬂuencer marketing for healthy foods does not directly aﬀect children’s and adolescents’ healthy food choice behavior, researchers very recently started investigating the factors that inﬂuencer marketing promoting healthy foods can have an impact on children’s and adolescents’ healthy food choice behavior. This is based on the Healthy Food Promotion Model (Folkvord, 2019), which suggests that potential individual and contextual factors might aﬀect the relationship between healthy food promotion and dietary behavior. For example, the studies of De Jans et al. (2021) and Folkvord et al. (2021) investigated contextual factors related to inﬂuencers. More speciﬁcally, they examined whether a social media inﬂuencer promoting a ﬁt lifestyle can aﬀect children’s healthy food choice behavior. Folkvord et al. (2021) showed that using a popular, ﬁt inﬂuencer led to a higher healthy food brand attitude and purchase intention among adults than a ﬁctitious ﬁt inﬂuencer via parasocial interaction. In addition, De Jans et al. (2021) found that using a social media inﬂuencer with a sedentary lifestyle (compared to an inﬂuencer with an athletic lifestyle) promoting food products resulted in more children and tweens (8–12 years) opting for healthy food option. Children’s and tweens’ healthy food choice behavior was higher when a social media inﬂuencer with a sedentary lifestyle (compared to an athletic lifestyle) promoted an unhealthy food product. Thus, these studies indicate that the characteristics of the social media inﬂuencer can aﬀect healthy food choice behavior among minors and adults. The current study, therefore, examines another personal characteristic of the social media inﬂuencer as a contextual factor possibly aﬀecting the relationship between healthy food promotion and healthy food behavior, namely, the weight of the inﬂuencer. In particular, this study examines and compares the impact of a thin-ideal inﬂuencer vs. an overweight inﬂuencer in promoting unhealthy vs. healthy foods on tweens’ healthy food choice behavior. Particularly on social media, conventional thin- ideals are increasingly challenged and there is a positive trend to more body diversity (Stewart and Ogden, 2021). At the same time, there is still a high stigmatization of overweight and obese people that is already deeply rooted in children’s assessments of others (Tiggemann and Anesbury, 2000). Thus, it is valuable to examine how the inﬂuencers’ body type aﬀects their promotional eﬀorts. Thin-Ideals in Inﬂuencer Marketing Promoting Healthy Foods Previous advertising research has already examined how the size or weight of a model aﬀects advertising eﬀectiveness and health outcomes. Some studies have shown that using a thin model in advertising is not more eﬀective in terms of advertising eﬀects compared to other-sized models (Halliwell and Dittmar, 2004; Sohn and Youn, 2013; Roberts and Roberts, 2015), other studies do suggest that using an endorser with ideal body-size is most eﬀective (Roozen, 2014). Nonetheless, research assumes that these results might also depend on the characteristics of the message’s receiver. For example, consumers who have internalized the thin-ideal are more receptive to thin models (Halliwell and Dittmar, 2004; Roberts and Roberts, 2015), and especially vulnerable youth may experience negative consequences from exposure to thin-ideal images (Stice et al., 2001). Besides its impact on advertising eﬀectiveness, a recent study by Stewart and Ogden (2021) showcases how using diverse body types in media messages was able to decrease negative weight bias, yet using thin-ideals was most eﬀective in increasing intentions to eat healthy in the adult, female sample. In addition, exposure to media displaying the thin-ideal body size is also linked to body dissatisfaction and body image disturbance, especially among girls and women (Hargreaves and Tiggemann, 2003; Grabe et al., 2008). While there is the trend to more body diversity, thin-ideal images are still omnipresent on social media. A popular trend on social media among social media inﬂuencers is thinspiration. Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 789069 fpsyg-13-789069 April 2, 2022 Time: 14:2 # 4 De Jans et al. Thin-Ideals in Inﬂuencer Posts This refers to the sharing of thin-ideal images (through the presentation of images that contain thin bodies) on social media to inspire certain body ideals and encourage followers and other social media users to be thin (Talbot et al., 2017). Exposure to thinspiration on social media has been shown to reduce body satisfaction (e.g., Yee et al., 2020; Dignard and Jarry, 2021) and was also connected to eating disorder symptoms (Rodgers et al., 2016). Thus, past research has mainly examined the negative consequences associated with thin-ideal images on social media. This study aims to examine whether the usage of thin-ideal endorsers in an inﬂuencer context can also be deployed to bring about a positive impact (namely tweens’ healthy food choice behavior, based on study results that showcase more healthy eating intentions due to thin-ideal representations for adult, female participants; Stewart and Ogden, 2021) or whether using a thin-ideal inﬂuencer only beneﬁts unhealthy food promotion, as it makes these products seem more attractive (Roozen, 2014). When children and adolescents watch a thin-ideal social media inﬂuencer promoting a healthy snack, they might be encouraged to also choose a healthy snack. This might be explained by the mechanism of wishful identiﬁcation, which refers to the desire to be or act just like the other person (the inﬂuencer in this case) (Hoﬀner, 1996; Schouten et al., 2020). In the context of inﬂuencer marketing, tweens look up to the inﬂuencers they follow and want to be just (as thin) as those inﬂuencers. Hence, they may believe that the inﬂuencer attained this ideal body size by consuming healthy foods such as the promoted healthy snack. Thus, through the process of wishful identiﬁcation (Hoﬀner, 1996), tweens will also be inclined to choose and consume healthy food to attain the same ideal body type of the inﬂuencer. On the other hand, unhealthy, excessive gain in weight, is based, among other things, on profuse consumption of unhealthy food (e.g., Swinburn et al., 2004; Rosenheck, 2008). And while this is by far not the sole reason for obesity, recent studies showcase that the belief that obesity is connected to unhealthy eating habits is already established in children’s reasoning to explain obesity (Tiggemann and Anesbury, 2000; Gonçalves et al., 2012). Thus, based on these most common conceptions, we assume that if an inﬂuencer who is overweight promotes an unhealthy snack, the attractiveness of this unhealthy snack might be diminished and tweens will opt to choose a healthy snack instead. Based on these assumptions, the following hypotheses are formulated: H1a: A thin-ideal inﬂuencer promoting a healthy (vs. unhealthy) snack will result in more tweens opting for the healthy snack. H1b: An overweight inﬂuencer promoting an unhealthy (vs. healthy) snack will result in more tweens opting for the healthy snack. How an Inﬂuencer’s Weight Affects Healthy Food Choice Behavior via Source Effects Based on the match-up hypothesis, communicators and their promoted products should ﬁt to be considered persuasive (see e.g., Till and Busler, 2000). Based on existing literature from the ﬁeld of celebrity endorsement (Bergkvist and Zhou, 2016) and inﬂuencer marketing (Breves et al., 2019; De Cicco et al., 2020; Schouten et al., 2020; Naderer et al., 2021), we expect that a seemingly good ﬁt between an inﬂuencer and an endorsed product (i.e., product–endorser ﬁt) might positively aﬀect the inﬂuencer and the advertised brand. For example, De Cicco et al. (2020) demonstrated with their study that inﬂuencer–product congruence increased the inﬂuencer’s credibility. In addition, a study by Schouten et al. (2020) showed that a good ﬁt between an inﬂuencer and the product embedded in the inﬂuencer’s Instagram post resulted in more positive attitudes toward the ad and higher purchase intentions compared to a poor ﬁt between the inﬂuencer and the endorsed product. Moreover, the good ﬁt between the inﬂuencer and the product also resulted in a higher endorser credibility. Hence, a good product–endorser ﬁt shows to be more favorable for the inﬂuencer. We expect that if the content on an Instagram proﬁle displays thin-ideal images, promotion of a healthy snack is more credible. We base this on study results by Connors et al. (2021) that showcase that for undergraduate students advertisements that feature thin models and healthy (vs. unhealthy) products lead to a greater product–model ﬁt. We, therefore, assume that the promotion of a healthy snack will make the thin-ideal inﬂuencer more credible and consequently more eﬀective to tweens compared to promotion of an unhealthy snack by the thin-ideal inﬂuencer. In a similar vein, we expect that the thin- ideal social media inﬂuencer will not only be perceived as more credible, due to a good product–endorser ﬁt, but that the inﬂuencer will also be admired more because the children and adolescents want to be just like the inﬂuencer. Moreover, social media oﬀer the opportunity for consumers to interact with social media inﬂuencers. Compared to traditional mass media that only allow for one-way communication, social media allow for two-way communication between social media inﬂuencers and their followers. Lou (2021, p. 1) deﬁnes the relationship between social media inﬂuencers and their followers as trans-parasocial relations, which she deﬁnes as “a collectively reciprocal, (a)synchronously interactive, and co-created relation between inﬂuencers and their captive followers.” In line with the reasoning concerning inﬂuencer credibility and inﬂuencer admiration, we expect that when there is a good ﬁt between the inﬂuencer and the endorsed product (when the thin-ideal inﬂuencer promotes a healthy snack), tweens will be more likely to have trans-parasocial interactions with this social media inﬂuencer as they reward authenticity. H2: Inﬂuencer credibility (a), inﬂuencer admiration (b), and trans-parasocial interaction with the inﬂuencer (c) will be higher after exposure to the thin-ideal inﬂuencer endorsing a healthy (vs. unhealthy) snack. However, as for the overweight inﬂuencer, we do not expect that a good product-endorser ﬁt will result in more positive source eﬀects. This is because the promotion of an unhealthy product by an overweight inﬂuencer might indicate undesired outcomes (i.e., unhealthy weight gain) obtained through consuming unhealthy foods (e.g., Swinburn et al., 2004; Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 789069 fpsyg-13-789069 April 2, 2022 Time: 14:2 # 5 De Jans et al. Thin-Ideals in Inﬂuencer Posts Rosenheck, 2008). This expectation is based on the social cognitive theory of Bandura (2001), which explains the improbability that a modeled behavior will be adopted when unfavorable consequences of that behavior are portrayed. Hence, we expect that the promotion of an unhealthy (vs. healthy) snack by an overweight inﬂuencer will result in more negative source eﬀects. H3: Inﬂuencer credibility (a), inﬂuencer admiration (b), and trans-parasocial interaction with the inﬂuencer (c) will be lower after exposure to the overweight inﬂuencer endorsing an unhealthy (vs. healthy) snack. MATERIALS AND METHODS Design and Procedure A two-by-two, between-subjects experimental study (inﬂuencer weight: thin-ideal vs. overweight; snack: unhealthy vs. healthy) was conducted. The participants were ﬁrst exposed to an Instagram proﬁle of an inﬂuencer (that either had a thin-ideal weight or was overweight). Then, the tweens saw an individual Instagram post of that same inﬂuencer promoting a snack (either unhealthy or healthy). Afterward, the tweens answered the same questionnaire. The experiment was conducted on computers in a classroom setting. The tweens were randomly allocated to one of the four conditions. A researcher was always present to guide the experiment. Stimuli Material To manipulate inﬂuencer weight, we created two Instagram proﬁles and two corresponding Instagram posts of a ﬁctitious inﬂuencer. This was the same ﬁctitious inﬂuencer in both cases; however, the inﬂuencer had a thin-ideal weight in the ﬁrst Instagram proﬁle and corresponding post, while the inﬂuencer was portrayed as overweight in the second proﬁle and corresponding post. Existing pictures of the ﬁctitious inﬂuencer were used for the thin-ideal weight conditions, and these pictures were Photoshopped for the overweight inﬂuencer conditions. A ﬁctitious inﬂuencer was used to avoid confounds with regard to previous experience with, existing attitudes toward and familiarity with the inﬂuencer. We made sure that the tweens perceived the ﬁctitious inﬂuencer to be an inﬂuencer by explaining to them what an inﬂuencer is before exposure to the stimulus material [“An inﬂuencer is a person with a lot of followers on social media (such as Instagram) who has an inﬂuence on others. An inﬂuencer uses videos, images, or blogs to promote a product or service”] and by informing them that they would see the Instagram proﬁle and post of Emma Duvillier, who is an inﬂuencer. Fictitious inﬂuencers are frequently used in experimental research on inﬂuencer marketing (e.g., De Veirman et al., 2017; Hudders and De Jans, 2021). In addition, to manipulate the portrayed snack, the inﬂuencer was either shown in the individual post holding carrots (i.e., healthy snack) or cookies (i.e., unhealthy snack). These food products were chosen as tweens perceive vegetables (such as carrots) as healthy food, while biscuits or cookies are perceived as snack foods, and thus unhealthy foods (McKinley et al., 2005). Participants In total, 146 tweens between 11 and 13 years (Mage = 11.33, SD = 0.49) participated in the study, and exactly 50% of them were girls. Tweens are young people between 10 and 13 years, and hence the age group between children and adolescents. They are an important target group for this study, as compared to children and adolescents, they are notable for their developmental changes (McArthur et al., 2021). In speciﬁc, young people develop healthy lifestyle habits in the tween period and rely on peer relations for their developmental health (Prinstein and Giletta, 2016; McArthur et al., 2021). We randomly selected the tweens from three diﬀerent high schools in Belgium, a West European country. Institutional ethical approval was obtained and active parental consent was requested for each tween participating in the study. Before the study, it was explained to the tweens that participation was completely voluntary and that they could opt- out at any moment during the study. Measures First, we used ten ﬁve-point semantic diﬀerentials to measure inﬂuencer credibility (Ohanian, 1990; α = 0.86, M = 3.44, SD = 0.66): “What do you think of [inﬂuencer]?” (“unattractive/attractive,” “not classy/classy,” “ugly/beautiful,” “unreliable/reliable,” “lies/tells the truth,” “dishonest/honest,” “untrustworthy/trustworthy,” “not an expert/an expert,” “inexperienced/experienced,” and “unknowledgeable/ knowledgeable”). In addition, we gauged inﬂuencer admiration using four items following De Jans et al. (2020; α = 0.84, M = 2.38, SD = 0.86), using a ﬁve-point Likert-scale ranging from “totally disagree” to “totally agree”: “I admire [inﬂuencer],” “I look up to [inﬂuencer],” “I would like to be just like [inﬂuencer],” and “I feel that [inﬂuencer] gives direction to my life.” Trans-parasocial interaction (Lou, 2021) was measured using eight items, adapted from the parasocial interaction scale of Lee and Watkins (2016) (α = 0.84, M = 2.36, SD = 0.78): “I would like to meet [inﬂuencer] in person,” “I look forward to watching [inﬂuencer]’s pictures,” “If I came across a picture of [inﬂuencer], I would deﬁnitely watch it,” “When I watch [inﬂuencer], it feels like (s)he is my friend,” “I think [inﬂuencer] is like a good friend,” “If there were a story about [inﬂuencer] in a newspaper or on the Internet, I would read it,” “[inﬂuencer] makes me feel comfortable, as if I am with friends,” and “When [inﬂuencer] shows me how she feels about a brand, it helps me make up my own mind about the brand.” These items were measured on a ﬁve-point Likert-scale ranging from “totally disagree” to “totally agree.” Finally, we measured food choice behavior using a binary behavioral measure by letting the children choose between a carrot (i.e., healthy snack) and a cookie (i.e., unhealthy snack) (Ngqangashe et al., 2018). More speciﬁcally, the tweens were told that they could choose a snack as a thank you for participating in the study and received the chosen snack.

Thin-Ideals in Inﬂuencer Posts Data Analysis To answer H1a and H1b, Chi-square tests were conducted. In addition, two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were done to answer H2 and H3. RESULTS Randomization The experimental groups did not diﬀer with respect to Instagram involvement [F(3,145) = 1.86, p = 0.140]. Manipulation Checks The manipulation of the weight of the inﬂuencer was measured with the question “What do you think about the weight of the inﬂuencer?” (“thin-ideal” or “overweight”). A 95.6% of the tweens that saw the inﬂuencer with the thin-ideal weight perceived the inﬂuencer as having a thin-ideal weight, which signiﬁcantly diﬀers from the 4.4% of the children that perceived the inﬂuencer as overweight (z = 10.6, p < 0.001). In addition, 62.8% of the children that saw the overweight inﬂuencer perceived the inﬂuencer as being overweight, while 37.2% perceived the inﬂuencer as having a thin-ideal weight (z = 3.2, p = 0.001). Hence, the manipulation of inﬂuencer weight was on average successful. We also conducted all the analyses with only the participants that correctly answered this manipulation check, but found the same results as reported below. Furthermore, the product that we displayed in the healthy post-condition (i.e., carrots) was perceived as more healthy (“How healthy do you think the carrots/cookies are?,” measured on a ﬁve-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 “not healthy at all” to 5 “very healthy”; M = 3.83, SD = 0.86) than the product in the unhealthy post-condition [i.e., cookies; M = 2.35, SD = 0.91; t(144) = 10.12, p < 0.001]. The manipulation of snack type was also successful. Interaction Effect of Snack Type and Inﬂuencer Weight on Food Choice Behavior When tweens saw the inﬂuencer with a thin-ideal weight, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence (χ2 = 0.04, p = 0.547) in their choice for the healthy snack after seeing the post with the healthy product (18.2%) vs. after seeing the post with the unhealthy product (20%; z = 0.20, p = 0.850). H1a cannot be conﬁrmed. However, when the tweens had been exposed to the overweight inﬂuencer (χ2 = 7.10, p = 0.007), they chose signiﬁcantly more for the healthy snack after seeing the post with the unhealthy product (50%) vs. after seeing the post with the healthy product (21.1%; z = 2.70, p = 0.008). This conﬁrms H1b. Interaction Effects of Snack Type and Inﬂuencer Weight on Source Effects There are no interaction eﬀects of snack type and inﬂuencer weight on inﬂuencer credibility [F(1,145) = 0.82, p = 0.367], inﬂuencer admiration [F(1,145) = 0.68, p = 0.410], nor on trans-parasocial interaction with the inﬂuencer [F(1,145) = 2.31, p = 0.131]. Hence, H2 and H3 cannot be conﬁrmed. However, we did ﬁnd main eﬀects of inﬂuencer weight on the source eﬀects. In particular, we found a main eﬀect of inﬂuencer weight on inﬂuencer credibility [F(1,45) = 10.10, p = 0.002]. The participants perceived the inﬂuencer as less credible when she was overweight (M = 3.28, SD = 0.64) compared to when she had a thin-ideal weight (M = 3.62, SD = 0.64). There was also a main eﬀect of inﬂuencer weight on inﬂuencer admiration [F(1,145) = 4.38, p = 0.038]. In speciﬁc, the tweens admired the inﬂuencer less when she was overweight (M = 2.24, SD = 0.77) vs. when she had a thin-ideal weight (M = 2.54, SD = 0.93). Yet, there was no main eﬀect of inﬂuencer weight on trans-parasocial interaction with the inﬂuencer [F(1,145) = 0.78, p = 0.380]: the tweens had the same level of connection with the inﬂuencer whether the inﬂuencer was overweight (M = 2.31, SD = 0.72) or whether she had a thin-ideal weight (M = 2.42, SD = 0.84). Additional and exploratory analyses (using PROCESS macro, Hayes, 2019, model 4) showed that the source eﬀects did not further aﬀect tweens’ snack choice. In speciﬁc, inﬂuencer credibility (B = 0.44, SE = 0.41, z = 1.07, p = 0.285), inﬂuencer admiration (B = −0.31, SE = 0.39, z = −0.79, p = 0.430), and trans-parasocial interaction with the inﬂuencer (B = 0.09, SE = 0.44, z = 0.20, p = 0.844) did not aﬀect children’s snack choice. Main Effect of Snack Type on Food Choice Behavior An exploratory analysis was conducted to examine the main eﬀect of snack type on food choice behavior. Of the tweens that we exposed to the healthy snack, 80.3% chose the unhealthy snack and 19.7% chose the healthy snack (z = 7.2, p < 0.001). Of the tweens that we exposed to the unhealthy snack, 64% chose the unhealthy snack and 36% the healthy snack (z = 3.4, p < 0.001). Hence, more children chose the unhealthy snack, independent of whether they were exposed to the promotion of the healthy or unhealthy snack. When we compare the percentages of tweens that chose the healthy snack, we can conclude that more tweens selected the healthy snack after exposure to the unhealthy snack (36%) compared to after exposure to the healthy snack (19.7%, z = 2.2, p = 0.029). Thus, more tweens chose the healthy snack after seeing the unhealthy snack. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The current study investigated whether the weight of a social media inﬂuencer could impact tweens’ healthy food choice behavior since previous research on inﬂuencer marketing showed that the mere exposure to inﬂuencer marketing for healthy foods did not aﬀect children’s and adolescents’ health food choice behavior. Therefore, this study examined how an inﬂuencer’s weight as a personal characteristic (thin-ideal vs. overweight) and the promoted snack-type (unhealthy vs. healthy snack) aﬀected tweens’ choice for a healthy snack. First and in general, the tweens chose more for the unhealthy snack, independent of whether they were exposed to unhealthy vs. healthy food placements in Instagram posts. This is in Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 789069 fpsyg-13-789069 April 2, 2022 Time: 14:2 # 7 De Jans et al. Thin-Ideals in Inﬂuencer Posts line with previous research among children and adolescents (Folkvord et al., 2013; Naderer et al., 2018) and can be explained by the inherent human preference for sweets and snacks (Desor et al., 1973; Harris et al., 1990). The results of the study also showed that tweens’ choice for the healthy snack was highest when an overweight inﬂuencer promoted an unhealthy snack in an Instagram post (compared to a healthy snack). This indicates that children and adolescents might no longer prefer unhealthy food when they are confronted with the potential assumed negative consequences of consuming it (Tiggemann and Anesbury, 2000; Gonçalves et al., 2012), and therefore, show a contrasting behavior (i.e., choosing the healthy snack). This result is in line with the study of De Jans et al. (2021), which showed that children chose more of a healthy snack when an unhealthy snack was promoted by a social media inﬂuencer showing a sedentary lifestyle compared to an athletic lifestyle. Hence, De Jans et al.’s (2021) study examined another possible negative consequence (i.e., sedentary lifestyle) associated with an unhealthy diet. These results may be explained by social cognitive theory, suggesting that when consequences of a particular behavior are considered negative, people will be less likely to adopt the modeled behavior (Bandura, 2001). In both studies, participants even showed contrasting behavior by opting for the opposite food option (i.e., the healthy option). When the tweens were exposed to the thin-ideal inﬂuencer, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in their choice for the healthy snack after seeing the post with the healthy vs. an unhealthy snack. Thus, a thin-ideal inﬂuencer did not make a healthy option more attractive to tweens but instead served as an appealing endorser for unhealthy snacks, which is somewhat worrisome. This is not in line with the study of Stewart and Ogden (2021) who reported that using thin-ideal body sizes in media messaging increased women’s intentions toward healthy eating. We could therefore assume that children are less motivated than adults to adopt or copy healthy behaviors due to a confrontation with ideal body images in media messages. We do have to mention that the study of Stewart and Ogden (2021) measured behavioral intentions whereas our study measured actual snack choice behavior by letting the tweens choose between diﬀerent food options. In sum, while prior research chieﬂy examined negative health outcomes due to media messages portraying thin-ideal body sizes such as body dissatisfaction and body image disturbance (e.g., Hargreaves and Tiggemann, 2003; Grabe et al., 2008), the current study examined whether thin- ideals in media messages could also result in positive health outcomes among tweens (i.e., healthy food choice behavior). The results of this study show that displaying thin-ideals in inﬂuencers’ posts on Instagram does not increase positive health outcomes among tweens. Finally, the inﬂuencer was perceived as less credible and was admired less when she was overweight vs. when she had a thin- ideal weight. This indicates prejudice against certain body types and manifests the predominant “thin equals healthy” stereotype (Connors et al., 2021) that should be addressed in future studies. This again is a somewhat critical result that points to deep-rooted prejudices and misconceptions against overweight and obese people. Overweight and obese people’s weight is still primarily perceived and explained by their lack of self- control when it comes to nutrition (Tiggemann and Anesbury, 2000). This is rather short-sighted and does not appraise the individual circumstances. Showcasing more body diversity in media messages and positively addressing this topic is needed to dismantle these prejudices. These results are also in line with prior research indicating that a social media inﬂuencer’s characteristics may aﬀect children’s evaluation of that inﬂuencer, whereby personal portrayals of an inﬂuencer suggesting an unhealthy diet or lifestyle may negatively aﬀect the inﬂuencer’s evaluation. In particular, the study of De Jans et al. (2021) showed that a social media inﬂuencer was less admired by children when portraying a sedentary lifestyle compared to an athletic lifestyle in his or her Instagram posts. Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research This study proposes several suggestions for future research. First of all, the current study used a ﬁctitious inﬂuencer for the Instagram proﬁles and individual posts to exclude any biases based on inﬂuencer familiarity or likeability, as is done in much extant research on inﬂuencer marketing (e.g., De Jans et al., 2021). We expected that tweens would be willing to adopt a portrayed behavior by an inﬂuencer due to wishful identiﬁcation (i.e., the desire to be or act like the inﬂuencer, Hoﬀner, 1996; Schouten et al., 2020); however, we assume that this wishful identiﬁcation and consequently tweens’ willingness to adopt a modeled behavior of an inﬂuencer would be higher when tweens know and follow the inﬂuencer. This idea is indeed conﬁrmed by the study of Folkvord et al. (2021), which showed that adults’ healthy food choice behavior was higher when they were exposed to a popular compared to a ﬁctitious inﬂuencer via parasocial interaction. Thus, we acknowledge that using a ﬁctitious inﬂuencer limits the validity of our study. Future research on inﬂuencer marketing promoting a healthy diet and lifestyle among children, tweens, and teens should use real and popular inﬂuencers. In addition, at the end of the experiment, the tweens were told that they could choose between two snacks as a thank you to participate in the study. These were the two food options that were used in the stimulus materials (cookies and carrots). Hence, it could be that the tweens recognized the study’s purpose and adapted their snack choice accordingly. Therefore, when measuring food choice behavior or snack choice, future research could let the participants choose between diﬀerent healthy and unhealthy options. In this way, we also reduce the possibility that the tweens choose a certain snack solely because of their liking or disliking of certain food products. Implications This study shows that exposure to a thin-ideal inﬂuencer did not aﬀect tweens’ choice for healthy vs. unhealthy foods. Hence, we suggest that using thin-ideal social media inﬂuencers does not stimulate a healthy diet among tweens. However, exposure to an overweight inﬂuencer promoting unhealthy snacks can positively aﬀect children’s choice of healthy food. These results could be explained by contrast eﬀects, as the overweight inﬂuencer Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 789069 fpsyg-13-789069 April 2, 2022 Time: 14:2 # 8 De Jans et al. Thin-Ideals in Inﬂuencer Posts is also perceived as less credible and is admired less by the tweens. Based on this main result, it is diﬃcult to draw a concrete recommendation for marketers or public policies when it comes to promoting healthy food to children and adolescents, as our results would suggest that the best way to promote a healthy diet is by using an overweight inﬂuencer promoting an unhealthy food product. Thus, we believe that it is not advisable to promote healthy food to children through the endorsement of unhealthy food by an overweight inﬂuencer, as this may perpetuate the stereotypes regarding overweight people in that people who do not have a thin ideal are unhealthy and eat unhealthy food (Connors et al., 2021). We do suggest inﬂuencers to be cautious with promoting food products in general, as promoting unhealthy food can have an impact on their followers’ unhealthy food behavior and lifestyle. Recent content analyses, however, show that inﬂuencers often abundantly endorse unhealthy food products in their videos (Coates et al., 2019c; Martínez-Pastor et al., 2021). Therefore, inﬂuencers should be made aware of the ethical responsibility they have when choosing to promote products. In addition, it would be helpful to strengthen initiatives that regulate the advertising of unhealthy foods to children. In Europe, the European Pledge initiative already takes measures to limit the endorsement of unhealthy foods to children under twelve. More speciﬁcally, this agreement prohibits the endorsement of foods that do not meet the predeﬁned nutritional criteria on inﬂuencer accounts targeting young children. Some argue, however, that the pledge cannot suﬃciently protect children from exposure to unhealthy foods (Neyens and Smits, 2017). Social media are still a relatively unregulated space in this regard, and marketers should be held accountable when targeting children with unhealthy products, especially since the negative consequences of marketing unhealthy foods to children are well known (Folkvord et al., 2022). Given the volatile nature of social media content, it is diﬃcult to monitor and penalize breaches. Future research is necessary to examine how social media inﬂuencers can be deployed to promote a healthy diet. For example, it could be investigated whether increasing children’s and adolescents’ food literacy through inﬂuencers’ social media posts can enhance children’s and adolescents’ healthy food behavior. In addition, we suggest that an inﬂuencer’s evaluation does not depend on which food product they promote considering their body type, as we did not ﬁnd interaction eﬀects of inﬂuencer weight and snack type on the inﬂuencer eﬀects. Nonetheless, the results indicate the need to tackle deep-rooted prejudice and assumptions about overweight and obese people in media messages, as our study shows that an inﬂuencer was evaluated less positively when being overweight. For example, inﬂuencers with diﬀerent body types could be deployed for the promotion of exercise campaigns among children by the government, or brands for healthy products or services could hire inﬂuencers with diﬀerent body types to promote their products on the inﬂuencers’ social media channels.
