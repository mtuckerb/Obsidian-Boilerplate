Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 4 ABOUT THIS HANDBOOK This Employee handbook (the “Handbook”) represents the personnel policies of Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates (“Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates” and/or “CATT Associates”). These policies are intended only as guidelines and are not intended as an employment contract;therefore, you should not treat them as such. We retain the right to modify these policies at any time. These policies are designed to enhance the company, and may be changed with or without notice, although we will make every eﬀort to keep you up to date of any necessary changes. It is important to note that the Management of CATT Associates may at any time vary from the guidelines if it, in its sole discretion, feels it would be in the best interest of the Company. It is the intent of CATT Associates to preserve at all times the Employment-at-Will Doctrine, which states that employment with CATT Associates is for an unspeciﬁed term and may be terminated at-will by either party, with or without cause or notice. CATT Associates will make every eﬀort to provide secure employment and rewarding careers to our employees, but we make no guarantee of length of employment or advancement. Opportunities for advancement will depend upon staﬃng needs, individual work performance, skills and capabilities, and your willingness to follow the standards of performance and conduct contained in this Handbook. As you read through the sections of your Handbook, you may notice general references made to CATT Associates, you, and your supervisor, etc. The main reason for this is for your convenience and ease of readability. As part of these references, please note: ● “CATT Associates\", “We” and “Company” means Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates, your employer. ● “You” means your person, an employee of CATT Associates. ● “Your supervisor” means the employee who is principally responsible for your performance and conduct, and to whom you report. From time to time, certain information found in this Handbook will change. As this happens, we will provide you with replacement pages and/or emailed updates to keep your Handbook as up to date as possible. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 5 With respect to all policies set forth in this Handbook and all other internal policies within separate departments of Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates, CATT Associates reserves the right to terminate an employee for any policy violation, regardless of the severity, frequency, or extent of the violation. With respect to any and all policies set forth herein or within individual departments of CATT Associates, there is no requirement for CATT Associates to provide an employee with progressive discipline (i.e., warnings prior to more severe discipline, including termination). Additionally, it is important to note that it is not possible to list every single behavioral problem or performance issue that could result in discipline or termination;therefore, employees may be disciplined or terminated for reasons not speciﬁed in this Handbook. If you ever have any questions or concerns, we encourage you to talk with your supervisor, senior management, or the company’s HR Consultant. Feel free to reach out on anything regarding beneﬁts, your paycheck, work expectations or any other items related to your employment with Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 6 GENERAL EMPLOYMENT POLICIES Employment At-Will Employment at Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates is an at-will relationship and nothing in this Handbook constitutes an expressed or implied contract of employment, regardless of anything which may appear in this Handbook or any other CATT Associates publication, policy or statement. You have the right to terminate your employment relationship for any reason, at any time, and CATT Associates reserves the right to do the same. Voluntary Termination of Employment Voluntary termination of employment is when an employee chooses to leave their job, either by resignation or mutual agreement with their employer. Employees can formally terminate their employment by submitting a resignation letter with two weeks' notice to their supervisor. Unfortunately, employees can also voluntarily terminate their employment by declining calls, not reporting to work, or ignoring messages. When this occurs, or a Clinical or Behavioral Health employee has not worked with a client in sixty (60) days, they will be considered to be voluntarily terminated. At that time, access to CATT company email and other accounts will be removed. At the discretion of Management, employees who had previously not worked with a client in sixty (60) days, and were considered voluntarily terminated, may be re-hired at a later date. Equal Employment Opportunity It is the policy of the Company to hire well-qualiﬁed people. An integral part of this policy is to provide equal employment opportunity for all people without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, citizenship status, marital status, sexual orientation, disabled or veteran status, gender identity or any other characteristic protected by law. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 7 It is our intention to consider qualiﬁed applicants from all sources to ensure equal consideration of individuals. Additionally, the Company will maintain all facilities in a completely non-segregated basis and will fully cooperate with all authorized individuals and agencies responsible for administering laws and regulations in the area of equal employment opportunity and fair employment practice. This policy extends to all employees and all aspects of the employment relationship and all personnel are hereby directed to take all reasonable eﬀorts to carry out the spirit and intent of the Company policy. Violations of this policy by any employee will be met with appropriate action. If you believe you have been subjected to any form of discrimination, or if you are aware of an incident of discrimination involving another individual, please provide a written or verbal report to your supervisor, a member of senior management and/or the company’s HR Consultant. To the extent possible, the report should be speciﬁc and should include the names of the individuals involved, the names of any witnesses and any documentary evidence (emails, notes, etc.). The Company will conduct a thorough and objective investigation and attempt to resolve the situation. The Company does not tolerate retaliation against an employee for reporting a violation of this policy or for participating in the Company’s investigation into potential violations of this policy. If the Company determines that this policy has been violated, it will take disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination. Disciplinary action may also be taken when an investigation reveals conduct on the part of an employee that does not rise to the level of unlawful discrimination and/or retaliation but is nevertheless inappropriate. Appropriate action may also be taken to deter future discrimination, retaliation, or misconduct. Disability Accommodation The Company is committed to complying with all applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Amendments thereto and applicable state law. It is the Company’s policy not to discriminate against any qualiﬁed employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such individual’s disability or perceived disability so long as the employee can perform the essential functions of the job. For purposes of this policy, “disability” means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity. Reasonable accommodation will be provided to qualiﬁed individuals with a known physical or mental disability if such accommodation would not impose an undue hardship on the Company and/or a direct threat to the health and/or safety of the individual or others would result. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 8 Any applicant or employee who believes he or she needs a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of the job should notify senior management and request such an accommodation. Provided such individual is qualiﬁed, the company will meet with the employee to further discuss and identify possible reasonable accommodations, if any, that will meet the individual’s needs. The company encourages the individual to fully cooperate with it in seeking and evaluating alternatives and accommodations. The company may require medical veriﬁcation of both the disability and the need for accommodation. If an accommodation is reasonable, will not impose an undue hardship, and will not pose a direct threat to the health and/or safety of the individual or others, the Company will make the accommodation. Where more than one accommodation would meet the needs of the individual and the Company, the company may choose to provide the accommodation that is easier and/or less costly to provide in accordance with applicable law. An employee or job applicant who has questions regarding this policy or believes that he or she has been discriminated against based on a disability should notify senior management. All such inquiries or complaints will be treated as conﬁdential to the extent permissible by law. Religious Accommodation The company will attempt to make reasonable accommodations for employees’ observance of religious holidays and sincerely held religious beliefs unless doing so would cause an undue hardship on the company’s operations. If you desire a religious accommodation, you are required to make the request in writing to senior management as far in advance as possible. Conﬁdentiality You may have access to records and other personal information about patients and other employees. This includes proprietary information, trade secrets and intellectual property to which the Company holds rights. You must not discuss or otherwise disclose this information with anyone else without proper authority. Although it is understood that a conﬁdentiality agreement inherently exists with each of CATT Associates’ employees, you may be asked during your employment with CATT to sign a conﬁdentiality agreement. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 9 We have developed company-speciﬁc ways to design, produce and market our products and services at CATT Associates. We believe that these techniques make our products and services more competitive in the marketplace;thus, they are not to be revealed to sources outside of CATT Associates. All company information, materials and resources are the property of Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates, and employees are prohibited from disclosing or using such for their own personal gain. Conﬂict of Interest A conﬂict of interest could exist when an employee (no matter what the level) or a member of his or her immediate family, has a ﬁnancial interest, direct or indirect, in a customer, supplier, competitor or other entity dealing with CATT Associates, and that ﬁnancial interest is of such extent or nature that it might reasonably aﬀect the judgment or decisions exercised on behalf of CATT Associates. For this reason, CATT Associates has established a Conﬂict-of-Interest policy, which states employees and their immediate families are not to participate in business ventures with patients or customers unless and until they are speciﬁcally approved by the Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates CEO. Additionally, personal investment by an employee or someone in his or her immediate family in the shares of a patient, customer, a potential customer, a competitor, or supplier could possibly create a conﬂict-of-interest situation and should be disclosed to the company so steps can be taken to avoid a conﬂict of interest. Outside activities or employment in common industries or related ﬁeld could be considered as a conﬂict of business interests because this could permit an employee to use the company’s proprietary information and “trade secrets”. Should an employee desire to participate in any such industry or work, the employee should ﬁrst seek the approval of the company. Further, employees are not to borrow money from any patient or customer of the company, unless the customer is a recognized lending institution. Staﬀ members cannot borrow from each other, nor shall oﬃcers and employees lend their personal funds to customers of the company, except to members of their immediate family. Finally, employees are not permitted to accept gifts (valued in excess of $50) or payments from patients or customers. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 10 Employment Classiﬁcation There are two general classiﬁcations recognized by the federal and state Wage and Hour laws:“exempt” and “non-exempt.” ● Exempt employees are executives, certain administrative employees with decision-making responsibilities, professionals, supervisors and commissioned employees. These employees are not eligible for overtime pay when they work more than a 40-hour workweek. ● Non-exempt employees include those in support level capacities, such as clerical positions. Non-exempt employees, under the federal and state Wage and Hour laws, are “not exempted from overtime pay,” meaning they are eligible to receive overtime pay: o Overtime is paid at the rate of time and one-half for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in one workweek (Monday through Sunday). o Days taken as Paid Time Oﬀ (PTO), holidays and other absences from work (paid or unpaid) are not considered as hours worked in computing overtime. Additional Classiﬁcations: ● Full-time employees are those individuals who are scheduled to work at least thirty (30) hours per workweek. They can be exempt or non-exempt. ● Part-time employees work fewer hours than full-time employees (less than thirty [30] hours a week). They can be exempt or non-exempt. Review your Paystub and/or On-Line Pay Portal To ensure that you are paid properly for all time worked and that no improper deductions are made, you must correctly record all work time and review your paychecks promptly to identify and to report all errors. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates makes every eﬀort to ensure our employees are paid correctly. Occasionally, however, inadvertent mistakes can happen. When mistakes do happen and are called to our attention, we will promptly make any corrections necessary. Please review your pay stub promptly each pay period to make sure it is correct. If you believe a mistake has occurred or if you have any questions, please contact the Business Director at once so that the issue may be addressed. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 11 Employee Performance, Growth, and Advancement Employee Review: Reviews are given at CATT to monitor the progress of your job performance and to build on feedback that you will be receiving throughout the year. It is our intention that the process help you develop skills, identify where you may need assistance performing the duties of your position, and, ultimately, foster employee growth. Formal performance reviews will be held annually. Salary reviews for non-clinical staﬀ are generally administered annually. It is our philosophy to base merit increases and/or bonuses on performance;we understand that compensation is critically important to our employees, and we intend to appropriately reward our high performing employees. Compensation for billable client hours is guided by health insurance reimbursement rates. CATT strives to compensate our Clinical and Behavioral Health employees working with clients at a generous rate from the start of employment, and reviews rates as health insurance reimbursement rates change. Additional review of compensation rates for Clinical employees occurs upon licensure change. Internal Transfers and Development: It is the policy of CATT Associates to encourage and support the professional growth of its employees. In that eﬀort based upon an employee’s qualiﬁcations, preference will be given to current employees whenever possible in ﬁlling available positions. An employee who wishes to be considered for an open position must meet the following conditions: ● The employee must be in their current role for at least 6months. ● The employee must meet the minimum requirements of the position being sought and must be in good standing. Meal and Rest Periods This policy applies to all Non-Exempt Employees. Meal Period: Employees who are scheduled to work, or do work, six (6) or more hours are entitled to and expected to take an unpaid, oﬀ-duty meal period of at least 30minutes. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 12 Rest Periods: Non-Exempt Employees are also expected to take a 15-minute paid rest period for every consecutive period of four (4) to six (6) hours worked. If an employee works 8or more consecutive hours, the employee must take a 30-minute break and an additional 15minute break for every additional 4consecutive hours worked. Expectations and Requirements Regarding Meal and Rest Periods: Non-Exempt employees are entitled to and expected to take the meal and rest breaks described above as a matter of law. No Supervisor, Manager or other Employee may request or require that you waive or skip your meal and/or rest period(s) or take a shorter meal or rest period. Employees must be relieved of all duties during their meal and rest periods. If for any reason you are not permitted to or are not provided the opportunity to take your meal and/or rest period(s), you must immediately report the missed meal and/or rest period to the company’s Human Resources Consultant. Likewise, you must report the missed meal and/or rest period on your timesheet. You should feel free to raise any concerns regarding this policy or any violations by a Supervisor without fear of any retaliation. Retaliation for reporting that you were not permitted to or not provided the opportunity to take your meal and/or rest period(s) is strictly prohibited. Any report of retaliation will be promptly and thoroughly investigated in accordance with the Company’s investigation procedures. If a complaint of retaliation is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, will be taken. Lactation Accommodation This policy is to establish guidelines for promoting a breastfeeding-friendly work environment and supporting lactating employees at the Company, for as long as they desire to express breastmilk. The Company supports the legal right and necessity of employees who choose to express milk in the workplace. Communication: A copy of this policy will be disseminated to every newly hired employee and to any employee who inquires about or requests pregnancy or parental leave. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 13 The Company will respond to an employee’s request for lactation accommodation within 5 business days. Breaks: Break time shall, if possible, run concurrently with employee’s lunch and/or break time. If the time for an employee’s break time does not run concurrently or when additional time is necessary, the break time may be unpaid. Lactation Space: The Company will provide breastfeeding employees with space in close proximity to the employee’s work area that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public to express breastmilk. The room will not be a bathroom. The room or location may include the place where the employee normally works if it otherwise meets the requirements of the lactation space. The lactation space will: ● Be safe, clean, and free of intrusion while expressing. ● Be free of toxic or hazardous materials and reasonably free from dirt or pollution. ● Contain a place to sit, a surface to place a breast pump and personal items. ● Have access to electricity. ● Have access to a sink with running water and a refrigerator in close proximity to employee work area. ● Multi-purpose rooms may be used as lactation space if they satisfy the requirements for space, however, use of the room for lactation takes priority over other uses. Retaliation Related to Breastfeeding or Expressing Milk is Prohibited: Retaliation against lactating employees for exercising their rights will not be tolerated. This includes those who request time to express breast milk at work and/or who lodge a complaint related to the right to lactation accommodations. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 14 CONDUCT AND STANDARDS Ethics Critical to our success as a business is conﬁdentiality, trust, and honesty. It is therefore your obligation to maintain the highest sense of integrity and honesty in all business practices. You are not permitted to use any knowledge or connections made through your position for your personal advantage. CATT Associates expects all employees to be honest and above reproach in both their business and personal dealings. If you become aware of any unacceptable circumstances or actions by any persons, including other employees, you should advise your supervisor or the Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates CEO immediately. We will not tolerate retaliation against any employee who complains of a problem or provides information in connection with any circumstances or actions which they perceive to be unacceptable. Inappropriate Conduct There are certain manners of conduct which will not be tolerated and will result in disciplinary action or immediate discharge. These include (but are not limited to): ● Violations of the law, or violations of regulations speciﬁc to our industry ● Harassment toward another employee or customer ● Discrimination or intimidation toward another employee or customer due to race, creed, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, citizenship status, marital status, physical disability, medical condition, age, status as a disabled veteran or veteran of the Vietnam Era or on any other legally prohibited basis ● Malicious gossip ● Creating or contributing to unsightly or unsanitary conditions ● Habitual tardiness or excessive absences ● Excessive disturbance to other employees during working hours ● Inappropriate conduct or excessively inappropriate language on Company premises ● Falsiﬁcation of Company records (including employment applications) ● Willful or negligent damage to company property or property of other employees Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 15 ● Insubordination, including failure or refusal to perform work as assigned, or use of abusive language or actions toward fellow employees, supervisors, or customers ● Abuse of alcohol or any intoxicant, or the use, possession, manufacture, distribution or dispensation of any illegal drug, narcotic, or controlled substance while on the job or on Company property. ● Any behavior or action which has the potential to cast CATT Associates in a negative spotlight. Attendance and Punctuality CATT is a professional organization, and all staﬀ members are expected to act responsibly. Employees are responsible for good attendance and punctuality. Absenteeism is costly, may cause unnecessary overtime, disrupt work schedules, and aﬀect employee morale. Excessive absenteeism may result in disciplinary action. Please familiarize yourself with our PTO policies for more clarity on this matter. If you are unable to come to work for any reason, you must call your supervisor before your normal starting time and report the reason for your absence. Every eﬀort should be made to speak with your manager directly, and voice mail or email should be used only if your manager is unavailable. This procedure should be followed for every day of absence unless your manager is aware that you will be out for a longer period and excuses you from calling every day. If you are unable to arrive at work at your normally scheduled time you should make every eﬀort to contact your manager with the reason for your lateness and your expected time of arrival. Employees are responsible for recording and maintaining any company designated tracking system so that it accurately reﬂects their attendance history. A record of your attendance and punctuality is maintained as one of your measures of your performance. Excessive absenteeism and lateness may result in disciplinary action. You are expected to make every eﬀort to report to work even if the weather is inclement unless it is unsafe for you to travel. Should you be unable to report to work, you must use PTO to receive pay for the day unless you are authorized to work remotely. Please note that an employee who is absent two consecutive workdays without notice shall be considered to have resigned without notice. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 16 Inclement Weather / Natural Disaster / Other Emergency Situations If weather is extremely hazardous, or other unforeseen circumstances arise such as ﬁre, ﬂooding damage, or something of a similar nature, etc., we may decide to open or close the oﬃce or business location at diﬀerent hours. If possible, your supervisor will notify you beforehand if an oﬃce is to be closed or working hours changed due to such circumstances. Please do not make assumptions about the status of your oﬃce based on weather or other emergency situations until you hear from your supervisor. Failing to show up at work can place an increased burden on the other employees who do come in as planned. As always, though, your personal safety is paramount, so if a situation arises where you feel that you cannot safely make it to work, please contact your supervisor to let them know. Personal Appearance CATT Associates strives to maintain a professional working atmosphere that promotes a positive image and a safe work environment. Employees contribute to the image and reputation of Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates in the way they present themselves. Good grooming, hygiene and appropriate dress reﬂect employee pride and inspire client conﬁdence. Additionally, our work environments may sometimes necessitate appropriate work apparel to help prevent injury. Employees should use good judgment in determining appropriate dress and grooming. You should strive to present yourself in a comfortable yet professional manner at all times while working in CATT Associates oﬃces, locations or in the community. Please refrain from wearing anything that could be considered to be oﬀensive or excessively distracting. Management may implement additional dress code requirements for certain positions and situations as needed. Employment of Family, Friends, Close Relatives Members of an employee’s immediate family, their friends or close relatives will be considered for employment on the basis of their qualiﬁcations. There are times where CEO Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 17 approval is required when considering family/friends for employment. CEO approval will be required when: ● Hiring the person allows for the potential of creating an adverse impact on work performance. ● Hiring the person results in a supervisor-direct subordinate relationship ● Bringing the person on creates the appearance of a conﬂict of interest. This policy is also considered when assigning, transferring, or promoting an employee. Sexual Harassment / Harassment / Discrimination Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates is committed to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the right to work in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and prohibits discriminatory practices, including harassment. Therefore, CATT Associates expects and requires that all relationships among persons in the workplace will be professional and free of bias, prejudice, and harassment. Equal Employment Opportunity: As an Equal Opportunity Employer, it is the policy of CATT Associates to ensure equal employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, citizenship status, marital status, sexual orientation, disabled or veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. CATT prohibits and will not tolerate any such discrimination or harassment. Individuals and Conduct Covered: This policy applies to all applicants, employees, and contractors, and prohibits harassment, discrimination and retaliation whether engaged in by fellow employees, by a supervisor, manager, senior executive or by someone not directly connected to CATT (e.g., an outside vendor, consultant, client, or customer). Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable not only in the workplace but also in any work-related setting outside the workplace, such as during business trips, business meetings and business-related social events. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 18 Deﬁnitions of Harassment: Sexual Harassment constitutes discrimination and is illegal under federal, state, and local laws. For the purpose of this policy, sexual harassment is deﬁned, as stated in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines, as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when, for example: ● submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual’s employment ● submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions aﬀecting the employee, or ● such conduct has the purpose or eﬀect of interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or oﬀensive working environment. Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and overt behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or diﬀerent genders. Conduct directed at an employee or an applicant for employment because of his or her gender may also be deemed to be sexual harassment. Examples of conduct that may be sexual harassment include, without limitation: ● Verbal conduct of a sexual nature such as talking about sex or sexual feelings, use of vulgar or crude expressions with sexual connotations, telling sexual jokes or stories, asking personal questions about dating or sexual life, making sexual comments or innuendoes, whistling, or making other suggestive sounds, repeatedly asking for dates or other personal attentions. ● Non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature such as displaying materials with sexually suggestive words or pictures (including through Company email, text messages, or the Internet), making sexual gestures, giving gifts or other items of a sexual or personal nature, staring at a person’s body or clothing, looking a person up and down, blocking a person’s path, hindering a person’s movement, or invading a person’s space by standing closer than appropriate under the circumstances. ● Physical conduct of a sexual nature such as touching, kissing, hugging, massaging, brushing up against another person, having sex or attempting to have sexual relations with another person. Although the intent of the person engaging in the conduct may seem to them to be harmless or even friendly, it may be unwelcome conduct to the recipient. It is important to note that the intent of the person engaging in the conduct is not the determining factor; Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 19 rather, the perception of the recipient of such behavior may actually be the determining factor. Remember that unwelcome sexual conduct may not always be apparent. “Putting up with” or submission to sexual conduct does not necessarily mean the conduct is welcomed. CATT Associates strongly urges all of its employees to refrain from engaging in any conduct of a sexual nature with other employees and speciﬁcally prohibits all of its employees from engaging in any conduct of a sexual nature in the workplace. Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. Under this policy, harassment is deﬁned as verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, citizenship, sexual orientation, marital status, disabled or veteran’s status or any other characteristic protected by law or that of his/her relatives, friends, or associates, and that: ● has the purpose or eﬀect of creating an intimidating, hostile or oﬀensive work environment. ● has the purpose or eﬀect of interfering with an individual’s work performance. ● otherwise adversely aﬀects an individual’s employment opportunities. Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts;denigrating jokes and display or circulation in the workplace of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group (including through text messages, company e-mail or the Internet). CATT Associates expects its employees, and all those who deal with its employees to treat others with courtesy and respect appropriate in a business setting. Judging Your Own Behavior: If you are not sure if your conduct might be harassment prohibited by CATT, you should ask yourself the following questions: ● Would I engage in that conduct if my boss were present? ● Would I engage in that conduct if someone with whom I have a close relationship (e.g., spouse, daughter, son, mother, father, sister, brother) were present? ● Would I engage in that conduct if an audio or video recording were being made of me? Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 20 ● What would my reaction be if someone else acted this way toward my daughter, son, spouse, mother, father, sister, or brother? ● Would I want my conduct to be described in detail in a company memorandum or in the local press? If your answer is “no” to any of these questions, then the conduct is questionable and may be harassment. Therefore, do not engage in it. In particular, with respect to sexual harassment, a friendly, humorous, or benign intent in engaging in sexual conduct will not keep the conduct from being categorized as sexual harassment. If the conduct is sexual in nature and is unwanted and unwelcome by others, it may be deemed to be sexual harassment. Although all sexual conduct may not rise to the level of being illegal sexual harassment, CATT’s policy prohibits all conduct of a sexual nature in the work setting. Similarly, although a single racial epithet may not constitute illegal racial harassment, CATT Associates’ policy against harassment prohibits all unwanted or inappropriate conduct based on race, color, national origin, gender, religion, age, sexual orientation, disability, citizenship, marital status, disabled or veteran’s status or any other characteristic protected by law. Retaliation is Illegal: Retaliation is illegal. CATT Associates prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination or harassment or participates in an investigation of such reports. Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or discrimination is a serious violation of this policy and, like harassment or discrimination itself, will be subject to disciplinary action. Complaint Procedure - Reporting an Incident of Harassment, Discrimination or Retaliation: CATT Associates strongly urges the prompt reporting of all incidents of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, regardless of the oﬀender’s identity or position. Individuals who believe they have experienced conduct that they consider is contrary to CATT Associates’ policy or who have concerns about such matters should ﬁle their complaints with their immediate supervisor, the Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates CEO or Human Resources. Individuals should not feel obligated to ﬁle their complaints with their immediate supervisor ﬁrst before bringing the matter to the attention of the Counseling Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 21 and Trauma Therapy Associates CEO or HR. Any supervisor who receives an initial complaint of harassment or discrimination or are witnesses to an incident of harassment or discrimination must report it immediately to the Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates CEO and/or HR. Important Notice to All Employees: Employees who have experienced conduct that they believe is contrary to this policy have a legal obligation to take advantage of this complaint procedure. An employee’s failure to fulﬁll this obligation could aﬀect his or her right to pursue legal action. Early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most eﬀective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment. Therefore, while no ﬁxed reporting period has been established, Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates strongly urges the prompt reporting of complaints of concerns so that rapid and constructive action can be taken. The availability of this complaint procedure does not preclude individuals who believe they are being subjected to harassing conduct from promptly and ﬁrmly advising the oﬀender that his or her behavior is oﬀensive or unwelcome and requesting that it be discontinued immediately. Investigating Complaints: Any reported allegations of harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be investigated promptly by CATT. The investigation may include individual interviews with the parties involved, and, where necessary, with individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or may have other relevant knowledge. Conﬁdentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory process to the extent consistent with adequate investigation and appropriate corrective action;though it is important for you to understand that complete conﬁdentiality may not be possible. Responsive Action: Misconduct constituting harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be dealt with appropriately. Responsive action may include, for example, training, referral to counseling and/or disciplinary action such as a warning, reprimand, withholding of a promotion or pay increase, reassignment, temporary suspension with or without pay, or termination, as CATT believes appropriate under the circumstances. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 22 This policy should not, and may not, be used as a basis for excluding or separating individuals of a particular gender, or any other protected characteristic, from participation in business or work-related social activities or discussions in order to avoid allegations of harassment. The law and the policies of CATT prohibit disparate treatment on the basis of sex or any other protected characteristic, with regard to terms, conditions, privileges, and perquisites of employment. The prohibitions against harassment, discrimination and retaliation are intended to complement and further this policy, not to form the basis of an exception to it. Any employee who makes a knowingly false accusation of discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Staﬀ members who have questions or concerns about this Policy are encouraged to speak with the Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates CEO and/or the company’s external HR Consultant. Employees may also ﬁle complaints of sexual harassment and other discriminatory harassment with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Maine Human Rights Commission. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission: 1-800-669-4000, 1-800-669-6820(TTY for Deaf/Hard of Hearing callers only), 1-844-234-5122(ASL Video Phone for Deaf/Hard of Hearing callers only), or info@eeoc.gov Maine Human Rights Commission 51State House Station Augusta, ME 04330 1-207-624-6290or info@mhrc.maine.gov Solicitations Solicitations by one employee of another are prohibited, while either is on working time.

Employees are strictly prohibited from using CATT Associates’ telephones, e-mail, and photocopiers for solicitation purposes. Charitable, Community, and Political Activities CATT employees may also volunteer their time to worthwhile organizations. We appreciate and are proud to see employees volunteering their time to the community. When doing so, we ask that it be performed on personal time. Lunch hours, or any period before or after work may be utilized for volunteer work connected with such obligations. However, meetings or any other eﬀorts associated with these activities should not be addressed during regular work hours. Additionally, employees are encouraged to participate in the electoral process and support the political candidates of their choice. All such activity must be conducted on the employee’s own time and outside Company property. Employees must not give the impression they are representing the company or acting on its behalf while taking part in political campaigning. No campaign literature is to be distributed on CATT’s property, and no eﬀorts should be made to convert other employees to a political cause during working hours. Employees who choose to run for political oﬃce must do so on their own time and at their own expense. Company premises cannot be used for political campaigning.

HIPAA Compliance As a Mental Health Agency, ensuring HIPAA compliance for our clients is of the utmost importance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule provides consumers with important privacy rights and protections with respect to their health information, including important controls over how their health information is used and disclosed by health care providers. Ensuring strong privacy protections is critical to maintaining individuals’ trust in their health care providers and willingness to obtain needed health care services, and these protections are especially important where very sensitive information is concerned, such as mental health information. At the same time, the Privacy Rule recognizes circumstances arise where health information may need to be shared to ensure the patient receives the best treatment and for other important purposes, such as for the health and safety of the patient or others. The Rule is carefully balanced to allow uses and disclosures of information—including mental health information—for treatment and these other purposes with appropriate protections. HIPAA Compliance & Email: Email communications regarding clients should only be sent from your CATT Associates email account, and never from an outside email address. Most communications will be internal to another CATT Associates email address, and therefore, are protected. External record requests for client information are managed by the Administrative team to assure HIPAA compliance. Questions regarding emailing with clients or externally should be directed to the Administrative team, to assure proper procedure. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 27 HIPAA Compliance & Texting: Text message communications regarding clients should only be reserved for scheduling communications, and when referencing a client, should only utilize their client initials, and never any other identifying information. HIPAA Compliance & Voicemails: According to HIPAA guidelines, healthcare providers can leave voicemail messages for patients, but they must be careful to limit the amount of protected health information (PHI) disclosed in the message, only including necessary details like the provider's name, contact number, and a request to call back, to ensure compliance;essentially, avoid sharing any speciﬁc medical details in the voicemail that could be overheard by others. HIPAA Compliance & Printers: The utmost care should be taken when printing documents that may contain protected health information (PHI). If you are printing documents of this nature, assure that you obtain the document from the printer right away, and keep it in a secure locked location. Once you are ﬁnished with the document, assure that it is properly shredded. Health and Safety CATT is committed to the safety of our employees and has established and will enforce the following procedures to maintain a safe workplace. CATT asks you to cooperate in helping to promote safety and to prevent accidents to yourself, and others by observing common sense procedures such as the following to eliminate hazards. ● Participate in the ﬁre drills held at any CATT location and learn your own duties in case of ﬁre. ● Help to avoid accidents by eliminating ﬁre hazards wherever you ﬁnd them. ● Promptly report all unsafe or potentially hazardous conditions, such as the following, to your manager: o wet or slippery ﬂoors, o equipment left in halls or in walkways, o exposed wiring or inadequate lighting, ● Do not operate electrical equipment with wet hands. ● Refrain from horse-playing and other, potentially dangerous activities. ● Immediately report all accidents to your manager. ● Always be on the alert for safety hazards on CATT sites and non-CATT staﬀ in Company oﬃces. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 28 Any concerns regarding your safety in the workplace should be brought to the attention of your Supervisor. Emergencies You should be familiar with emergency phone numbers in your area and your oﬃce location. In the event of an emergency, dial 911. In Case of a Fire Emergency: ● Call the ﬁre department - 911. ● Sound the nearest building ﬁre alarm (located at the emergency ﬁre exits).

Substance Abuse and Drug-Free Workplace Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates’ policy is to maintain a workplace that is free from the eﬀects of illicit drug use and alcohol abuse. Each employee’s continued employment is dependent upon abiding by the terms of this policy. This policy also satisﬁes CATT’s obligations under the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1998: CATT maintains a drug-free workplace. The eﬀects of drugs and/or alcohol abuse can have an adverse impact on the Company and have the potential to aﬀect an individual’s ability to perform work in a safe and productive manner. A basic objective of the Company is to maintain a work environment free from the eﬀects of illicit drug or alcohol abuse or misuse. Through the implementation of this policy, Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 29 we hope to encourage employees who may have alcohol or substance abuse problems to seek treatment and counseling so they can be positive, contributing CATT employees. This policy is intended in no way to modify the “at will” relationship between the Company and its employees, therefore, either the Company or employee will still be free to terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause or notice. Smoke Free Air Policy In the interest of maintaining a healthy work environment, and in compliance with the Maine Clean Indoor Air Act, smoking and/or vaping is prohibited in all areas of CATT’s oﬃces. This policy also includes the use of smokeless tobacco products such as chewing tobacco and snuﬀ. Smoking, vaping, and usage of smokeless tobacco products is not permitted anywhere on the premises at all Company locations. Please note that the burning of candles in oﬃces, cubicles, or anywhere else on Company premises is also prohibited. This decision was determined to be in the best interest of all employees due to ﬁre safety concerns. Handwashing Policy Many diseases and conditions are spread by not washing hands with soap and clean, running water. Handwashing with soap is one of the best ways to keep you, your colleagues and your clients healthy. CATT employees should follow the CDC guidance for handwashing. Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most eﬀective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Follow these ﬁve steps every time. 1. Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn oﬀ the tap, and apply soap. 2. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your ﬁngers, and under your nails. 3. Scrub your hands for at least 20seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice. 4. Rinse your hands well under clean, running water. 5. Dry your hands using a clean towel or an air dryer. Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 30 Use hand sanitizer when you can't use soap and water: Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol by looking at the product label. Security As a valued employee of CATT, we want you to feel secure in your place of work at all times. In addition to being safe in the workplace, it is also each of our responsibilities to proactively maintain a safe and secure workplace for the protection of ourselves, our colleagues, and company interests. In order to do so, all employees are requested to follow these guidelines when clients are in our oﬃces: ● All employees need to ensure that any client coming to meet them has made a prior appointment.   ● Clients should be instructed to await their appointment in the designated waiting room, and should not enter other spaces within the oﬃce aside from the restroom. ● If there is ever a security or building issue, please reach out to the Business Director immediately at 207-370-8411. ● If there is an emergency situation, and the safety of you or anyone around you is at risk, do not hesitate to call 911. ● If you are ﬁnished with your appointments for the day, assure that your client leaves the building with you. ● If you are the last person to leave the oﬃce, please make sure that all lights and sound machines are turned oﬀ, and all doors are locked. ● Oﬃce windows should not be opened and should remain locked. ● Do not leave sensitive materials lying around on your desk or in common areas such as printers, conference rooms, on top of ﬁling cabinets, etc. ● Shred sensitive materials instead of discarding them in trash receptacles. In addition, it is imperative that employees familiarize themselves with the Company’s Electronic Communications Policy, which, among other important items, directs employees to refrain from writing down their passwords on their workstations or computer equipment, as well as assuring that workstation computers are locked or shut down when Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 31 not in use. Collectively by following these guidelines we can proactively maintain a safe and secure workplace for the protection of ourselves, or clients and company interests. Workplace Violence Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates mandates a “zero tolerance for violence” environment and will make every eﬀort to prevent violent incidents from occurring. Violence, for our purposes, includes:Physically harming another, shouting, shoving, pushing, intimidation, coercion, brandishing weapons, and threats or talk of violence. This policy applies to all employees, full-time or part-time, and also to any temporary or contract worker of CATT. Hereinafter, for the purposes of this policy only, “employee” shall refer to all of the aforementioned worker classiﬁcations. Prompt and accurate reporting of all violent incidents, whether or not physical injury has occurred, is required. If any violence or threats of violence by an employee is displayed in the workplace, that employee may be subject to immediate termination. No talk of violence or joking about violence will be tolerated. Incidents are to be reported immediately to the Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates CEO for further attention. However, supervisors, or those witnessing an incident, are expected to take the necessary action if immediate attention is deemed appropriate. Necessary action is deﬁned as contacting law enforcement and senior management of CATT, according to the severity of the incident. Employees can assist in the prevention of workplace violence by reporting any incident they see within the workplace that could indicate that a co-worker may be in danger. It is important to report any incident witnessed or heard about that may involve a violation of any CATT policy designed to provide a safe workplace environment. Concerns about potential violence may be presented to your supervisor, the company’s HR Consultant, or to the Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates CEO. All reports will be investigated as conﬁdentially as possible. Weapons CATT wishes to maintain a work environment that is free of ﬁrearms, knives, explosives, lethal weapons not previously mentioned or other improper materials such as pocket-size pepper spray, pocket-size mace, etc. CATT reserves the right to determine what materials Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates:Employee Handbook (Updated December 18,2024) Page 32 are considered improper. To this end, and to the extent not prohibited by state or federal law, CATT prohibits the possession, transfer, sale, or use of such materials on its premises. CATT requires the cooperation of all employees in administering this policy. Desks, lockers, and other storage devices may be provided for the convenience of employees but remain the sole property of CATT. Accordingly, they, as well as any containers or articles found within them, can be inspected by any agent or representative of CATT at any time, either with or without prior notice. Containers may include, but are not limited to the following:packet, package, purse, briefcase, clothing, toolbox, lunch box, satchel, or other such container.
