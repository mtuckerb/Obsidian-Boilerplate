State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – Adult (STAI-AD) Understanding and Managing Stress Other instruments related to Anxiety and Stress by Charles D. Spielberger by Robert Most and Theresa Muñoz The definitive instrument for measuring anxiety in adults. It clearly differentiates between the temporary condition of “state anxiety” and the more general and long-standing quality of “trait anxiety”. It helps professionals distinguish between a client’s feelings of anxiety and depression. The inventory’s simplicity makes it ideal for evaluating individuals with lower educational backgrounds. This forty-page workbook offers individuals a comprehensive approach to managing stress. The workbook includes basic strategies for: managing daily on-the-spot stress; problem and emotion focused coping skills; and improving personal and work lifestyle; as well as resources for further exploration. These instruments measure anxiety or stress in a variety of situations including test anxiety, school-related stress, and anxiety as a state-like and trait-like construct. Many of these instruments are complimented by reports or workbooks that provide tips and exercises to manage stress and anxiety. We offer such instruments as Hassles & Uplifts and the Psychological Distress Profile. PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE by Sheldon Cohen The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one’s life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. The PSS was designed for use in community samples with at least a junior high school education. The items are easy to understand, and the response alternatives are simple to grasp. Moreover, the questions are of a general nature and hence are relatively free of content specific to any subpopulation group. The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, respondents are asked how often they felt a certain way. Evidence for Validity: Higher PSS scores were associated with (for example):  failure to quit smoking  failure among diabetics to control blood sugar levels  greater vulnerability to stressful life-event-elicited depressive symptoms  more colds Health status relationship to PSS: Cohen et al. (1988) show correlations with PSS and: Stress Measures, Self- Reported Health and Health Services Measures, Health Behavior Measures, Smoking Status, Help Seeking Behavior. Temporal Nature: Because levels of appraised stress should be influenced by daily hassles, major events, and changes in coping resources, predictive validity of the PSS is expected to fall off rapidly after four to eight weeks. Scoring: PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 & 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, & 8) and then summing across all scale items. A short 4 item scale can be made from questions 2, 4, 5 and 10 of the PSS 10 item scale. Norm Groups: L. Harris Poll gathered information on 2,387 respondents in the U.S. Norm Table for the PSS 10 item inventory Category N Mean S.D.
