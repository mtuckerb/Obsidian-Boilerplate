J. RousseauINTRODUCTORY NOTEJean Jacques Rousseau was born at Geneva, June 28, 1712, the son of awatchmaker of French origin. His education was irregular, and thoughhe tried many professions--including engraving, music, andteaching--he found it difficult to support himself in any of them. Thediscovery of his talent as a writer came with the winning of a prizeoffered by the Academy of Dijon for a discourse on the question,\"Whether the progress of the sciences and of letters has tended tocorrupt or to elevate morals.\" He argued so brilliantly that thetendency of civilization was degrading that he became at once famous.The discourse here printed on the causes of inequality among men waswritten in a similar competition.He now concentrated his powers upon literature, producing two novels,\"La Nouvelle Heloise,\" the forerunner and parent of endlesssentimental and picturesque fictions; and \"Emile, ou l'Education,\" awork which has had enormous influence on the theory and practise ofpedagogy down to our own time and in which the Savoyard Vicar appears,who is used as the mouthpiece for Rousseau's own religious ideas. \"LeContrat Social\" (1762) elaborated the doctrine of the discourse oninequality. Both historically and philosophically it is unsound; butit was the chief literary source of the enthusiasm for liberty,fraternity, and equality, which inspired the leaders of the FrenchRevolution, and its effects passed far beyond France.His most famous work, the \"Confessions,\" was published after hisdeath. This book is a mine of information as to his life, but it isfar from trustworthy; and the picture it gives of the author'spersonality and conduct, though painted in such a way as to make itabsorbingly interesting, is often unpleasing in the highest degree.But it is one of the great autobiographies of the world.During Rousseau's later years he was the victim of the delusion ofpersecution; and although he was protected by a succession of goodfriends, he came to distrust and quarrel with each in turn. He died atErmenonville, near Paris, July 2, 1778, the most widely influentialFrench writer of his age.The Savoyard Vicar and his \"Profession of Faith\" are introduced into\"Emile\" not, according to the author, because he wishes to exhibit hisprinciples as those which should be taught, but to give an example ofthe way in which religious matters should be discussed with the young.Nevertheless, it is universally recognized that these opinions areRousseau's own, and represent in short form his characteristicattitude toward religious belief. The Vicar himself is believed tocombine the traits of two Savoyard priests whom Rousseau knew in hisyouth. The more important was the Abbe Gaime, whom he had known atTurin; the other, the Abbe Gatier, who had taught him at Annecy.QUESTION PROPOSED BY THE ACADEMY OF DIJONWhat is the Origin of the Inequality among Mankind; and whether suchInequality is authorized by the Law of Nature?A DISCOURSE UPON THE ORIGIN AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE INEQUALITY AMONGMANKIND'Tis of man I am to speak; and the very question, in answer to which Iam to speak of him, sufficiently informs me that I am going to speakto men; for to those alone, who are not afraid of honouring truth, itbelongs to propose discussions of this kind. I shall thereforemaintain with confidence the cause of mankind before the sages, whoinvite me to stand up in its defence; and I shall think myself happy,if I can but behave in a manner not unworthy of my subject and of myjudges.I conceive two species of inequality among men; one which I callnatural, or physical inequality, because it is established by nature,and consists in the difference of age, health, bodily strength, andthe qualities of the mind, or of the soul; the other which may betermed moral, or political inequality, because it depends on a kind ofconvention, and is established, or at least authorized, by the commonconsent of mankind. This species of inequality consists in thedifferent privileges, which some men enjoy, to the prejudice ofothers, such as that of being richer, more honoured, more powerful,and even that of exacting obedience from them.It were absurd to ask, what is the cause of natural inequality, seeingthe bare definition of natural inequality answers the question: itwould be more absurd still to enquire, if there might not be someessential connection between the two species of inequality, as itwould be asking, in other words, if those who command are necessarilybetter men than those who obey; and if strength of body or of mind,wisdom or virtue are always to be found in individuals, in the sameproportion with power, or riches: a question, fit perhaps to bediscussed by slaves in the hearing of their masters, but unbecomingfree and reasonable beings in quest of truth.What therefore is precisely the subject of this discourse? It is topoint out, in the progress of things, that moment, when, right takingplace of violence, nature became subject to law; to display that chainof surprising events, in consequence of which the strong submitted toserve the weak, and the people to purchase imaginary ease, at theexpense of real happiness.The philosophers, who have examined the foundations of society, have,every one of them, perceived the necessity of tracing it back to astate of nature, but not one of them has ever arrived there. Some ofthem have not scrupled to attribute to man in that state the ideas ofjustice and injustice, without troubling their heads to prove, that hereally must have had such ideas, or even that such ideas were usefulto him: others have spoken of the natural right of every man to keepwhat belongs to him, without letting us know what they meant by theword belong; others, without further ceremony ascribing to thestrongest an authority over the weakest, have immediately struck outgovernment, without thinking of the time requisite for men to form anynotion of the things signified by the words authority and government.All of them, in fine, constantly harping on wants, avidity,oppression, desires and pride, have transferred to the state of natureideas picked up in the bosom of society. In speaking of savages theydescribed citizens. Nay, few of our own writers seem to have so muchas doubted, that a state of nature did once actually exit; though itplainly appears by Sacred History, that even the first man,immediately furnished as he was by God himself with both instructionsand precepts, never lived in that state, and that, if we give to thebooks of Moses that credit which every Christian philosopher ought togive to them, we must deny that, even before the deluge, such a stateever existed among men, unless they fell into it by some extraordinaryevent: a paradox very difficult to maintain, and altogether impossibleto prove.Let us begin therefore, by laying aside facts, for they do not affectthe question. The researches, in which we may engage on this occasion,are not to be taken for historical truths, but merely as hypotheticaland conditional reasonings, fitter to illustrate the nature of things,than to show their true origin, like those systems, which ournaturalists daily make of the formation of the world. Religioncommands us to believe, that men, having been drawn by God himself outof a state of nature, are unequal, because it is his pleasure theyshould be so; but religion does not forbid us to draw conjecturessolely from the nature of man, considered in itself, and from that ofthe beings which surround him, concerning the fate of mankind, hadthey been left to themselves. This is then the question I am toanswer, the question I propose to examine in the present discourse. Asmankind in general have an interest in my subject, I shall endeavourto use a language suitable to all nations; or rather, forgetting thecircumstances of time and place in order to think of nothing but themen I speak to, I shall suppose myself in the Lyceum of Athens,repeating the lessons of my masters before the Platos and theXenocrates of that famous seat of philosophy as my judges, and inpresence of the whole human species as my audience.O man, whatever country you may belong to, whatever your opinions maybe, attend to my words; you shall hear your history such as I think Ihave read it, not in books composed by those like you, for they areliars, but in the book of nature which never lies. All that I shallrepeat after her, must be true, without any intermixture of falsehood,but where I may happen, without intending it, to introduce my ownconceits. The times I am going to speak of are very remote. How muchyou are changed from what you once were! 'Tis in a manner the life ofyour species that I am going to write, from the qualities which youhave received, and which your education and your habits could deprave,but could not destroy. There is, I am sensible, an age at which everyindividual of you would choose to stop; and you will look out for theage at which, had you your wish, your species had stopped. Uneasy atyour present condition for reasons which threaten your unhappyposterity with still greater uneasiness, you will perhaps wish it werein your power to go back; and this sentiment ought to be considered,as the panegyric of your first parents, the condemnation of yourcontemporaries, and a source of terror to all those who may have themisfortune of succeeding you.DISCOURSE FIRST PARTHowever important it may be, in order to form a proper judgment of thenatural state of man, to consider him from his origin, and to examinehim, as it were, in the first embryo of the species; I shall notattempt to trace his organization through its successive approaches toperfection: I shall not stop to examine in the animal system what hemight have been in the beginning, to become at last what he actuallyis; I shall not inquire whether, as Aristotle thinks, his neglectednails were no better at first than crooked talons; whether his wholebody was not, bear-like, thick covered with rough hair; and whether,walking upon all-fours, his eyes, directed to the earth, and confinedto a horizon of a few paces extent, did not at once point out thenature and limits of his ideas. I could only form vague, and almostimaginary, conjectures on this subject. Comparative anatomy has not asyet been sufficiently improved; neither have the observations ofnatural philosophy been sufficiently ascertained, to establish uponsuch foundations the basis of a solid system. For this reason, withouthaving recourse to the supernatural informations with which we havebeen favoured on this head, or paying any attention to the changes,that must have happened in the conformation of the interior andexterior parts of man's body, in proportion as he applied his membersto new purposes, and took to new aliments, I shall suppose hisconformation to have always been, what we now behold it; that healways walked on two feet, made the same use of his hands that we doof ours, extended his looks over the whole face of nature, andmeasured with his eyes the vast extent of the heavens.If I strip this being, thus constituted, of all the supernatural giftswhich he may have received, and of all the artificial faculties, whichwe could not have acquired but by slow degrees; if I consider him, ina word, such as he must have issued from the hands of nature; I see ananimal less strong than some, and less active than others, but, uponthe whole, the most advantageously organized of any; I see himsatisfying the calls of hunger under the first oak, and those ofthirst at the first rivulet; I see him laying himself down to sleep atthe foot of the same tree that afforded him his meal; and behold, thisdone, all his wants are completely supplied.The earth left to its own natural fertility and covered with immensewoods, that no hatchet ever disfigured, offers at every step food andshelter to every species of animals. Men, dispersed among them,observe and imitate their industry, and thus rise to the instinct ofbeasts; with this advantage, that, whereas every species of beasts isconfined to one peculiar instinct, man, who perhaps has not any thatparticularly belongs to him, appropriates to himself those of allother animals, and lives equally upon most of the different aliments,which they only divide among themselves; a circumstance whichqualifies him to find his subsistence, with more ease than any ofthem.Men, accustomed from their infancy to the inclemency of the weather,and to the rigour of the different seasons; inured to fatigue, andobliged to defend, naked and without arms, their life and their preyagainst the other wild inhabitants of the forest, or at least to avoidtheir fury by flight, acquire a robust and almost unalterable habit ofbody; the children, bringing with them into the world the excellentconstitution of their parents, and strengthening it by the sameexercises that first produced it, attain by this means all the vigourthat the human frame is capable of. Nature treats them exactly in thesame manner that Sparta treated the children of her citizens; thosewho come well formed into the world she renders strong and robust, anddestroys all the rest; differing in this respect from our societies,in which the state, by permitting children to become burdensome totheir parents, murders them all without distinction, even in the wombsof their mothers.The body being the only instrument that savage man is acquainted with,he employs it to different uses, of which ours, for want of practice,are incapable; and we may thank our industry for the loss of thatstrength and agility, which necessity obliges him to acquire. Had he ahatchet, would his hand so easily snap off from an oak so stout abranch? Had he a sling, would it dart a stone to so great a distance?Had he a ladder, would he run so nimbly up a tree? Had he a horse,would he with such swiftness shoot along the plain? Give civilized manbut time to gather about him all his machines, and no doubt he will bean overmatch for the savage: but if you have a mind to see a conteststill more unequal, place them naked and unarmed one opposite to theother; and you will soon discover the advantage there is inperpetually having all our forces at our disposal, in being constantlyprepared against all events, and in always carrying ourselves, as itwere, whole and entire about us.Hobbes would have it that man is naturally void of fear, and alwaysintent upon attacking and fighting. An illustrious philosopher thinkson the contrary, and Cumberland and Puffendorff likewise affirm it,that nothing is more fearful than man in a state of nature, that he isalways in a tremble, and ready to fly at the first motion heperceives, at the first noise that strikes his ears. This, indeed, maybe very true in regard to objects with which he is not acquainted; andI make no doubt of his being terrified at every new sight thatpresents itself, as often as he cannot distinguish the physical goodand evil which he may expect from it, nor compare his forces with thedangers he has to encounter; circumstances that seldom occur in astate of nature, where all things proceed in so uniform a manner, andthe face of the earth is not liable to those sudden and continualchanges occasioned in it by the passions and inconstancies ofcollected bodies. But savage man living among other animals withoutany society or fixed habitation, and finding himself early under anecessity of measuring his strength with theirs, soon makes acomparison between both, and finding that he surpasses them more inaddress, than they surpass him in strength, he learns not to be anylonger in dread of them. Turn out a bear or a wolf against a sturdy,active, resolute savage, (and this they all are,) provided with stonesand a good stick; and you will soon find that the danger is at leastequal on both sides, and that after several trials of this kind, wildbeasts, who are not fond of attacking each other, will not be veryfond of attacking man, whom they have found every whit as wild asthemselves. As to animals who have really more strength than man hasaddress, he is, in regard to them, what other weaker species are, whofind means to subsist notwithstanding; he has even this greatadvantage over such weaker species, that being equally fleet withthem, and finding on every tree an almost inviolable asylum, he isalways at liberty to take it or leave it, as he likes best, and ofcourse to fight or to fly, whichever is most agreeable to him. To thiswe may add that no animal naturally makes war upon man, except in thecase of self-defence or extreme hunger; nor ever expresses against himany of these violent antipathies, which seem to indicate that someparticular species are intended by nature for the food of others.But there are other more formidable enemies, and against which man isnot provided with the same means of defence; I mean naturalinfirmities, infancy, old age, and sickness of every kind, melancholyproofs of our weakness, whereof the two first are common to allanimals, and the last chiefly attends man living in a state ofsociety. It is even observable in regard to infancy, that the motherbeing able to carry her child about with her, wherever she goes, canperform the duty of a nurse with a great deal less trouble, than thefemales of many other animals, who are obliged to be constantly goingand coming with no small labour and fatigue, one way to look out fortheir own subsistence, and another to suckle and feed their youngones. True it is that, if the woman happens to perish, her child isexposed to the greatest danger of perishing with her; but this dangeris common to a hundred other species, whose young ones require a greatdeal of time to be able to provide for themselves; and if our infancyis longer than theirs, our life is longer likewise; so that, in thisrespect too, all things are in a manner equal; not but that there areother rules concerning the duration of the first age of life, and thenumber of the young of man and other animals, but they do not belongto my subject. With old men, who stir and perspire but little, thedemand for food diminishes with their abilities to provide it; and asa savage life would exempt them from the gout and the rheumatism, andold age is of all ills that which human assistance is least capable ofalleviating, they would at last go off, without its being perceived byothers that they ceased to exist, and almost without perceiving itthemselves.In regard to sickness, I shall not repeat the vain and falsedeclamations made use of to discredit medicine by most men, while theyenjoy their health; I shall only ask if there are any solidobservations from which we may conclude that in those countries wherethe healing art is most neglected, the mean duration of man's life isshorter than in those where it is most cultivated? And how is itpossible this should be the case, if we inflict more diseases uponourselves than medicine can supply us with remedies! The extremeinequalities in the manner of living of the several classes ofmankind, the excess of idleness in some, and of labour in others, thefacility of irritating and satisfying our sensuality and ourappetites, the too exquisite and out of the way aliments of the rich,which fill them with fiery juices, and bring on indigestions, theunwholesome food of the poor, of which even, bad as it is, they veryoften fall short, and the want of which tempts them, every opportunitythat offers, to eat greedily and overload their stomachs; watchings,excesses of every kind, immoderate transports of all the passions,fatigues, waste of spirits, in a word, the numberless pains andanxieties annexed to every condition, and which the mind of man isconstantly a prey to; these are the fatal proofs that most of our illsare of our own making, and that we might have avoided them all byadhering to the simple, uniform and solitary way of life prescribed tous by nature. Allowing that nature intended we should always enjoygood health, I dare almost affirm that a state of reflection is astate against nature, and that the man who meditates is a depravedanimal. We need only call to mind the good constitution of savages,of those at least whom we have not destroyed by our strong liquors; weneed only reflect, that they are strangers to almost every disease,except those occasioned by wounds and old age, to be in a mannerconvinced that the history of human diseases might be easily composedby pursuing that of civil societies. Such at least was the opinion ofPlato, who concluded from certain remedies made use of or approved byPodalyrus and Macaon at the Siege of Troy, that several disorders,which these remedies were found to bring on in his days, were notknown among men at that remote period.Man therefore, in a state of nature where there are so few sources ofsickness, can have no great occasion for physic, and still less forphysicians; neither is the human species more to be pitied in thisrespect, than any other species of animals. Ask those who make huntingtheir recreation or business, if in their excursions they meet withmany sick or feeble animals. They meet with many carrying the marks ofconsiderable wounds, that have been perfectly well healed and closedup; with many, whose bones formerly broken, and whose limbs almosttorn off, have completely knit and united, without any other surgeonbut time, any other regimen but their usual way of living, and whosecures were not the less perfect for their not having been torturedwith incisions, poisoned with drugs, or worn out by diet andabstinence. In a word, however useful medicine well administered maybe to us who live in a state of society, it is still past doubt, thatif, on the one hand, the sick savage, destitute of help, has nothingto hope from nature, on the other, he has nothing to fear but from hisdisease; a circumstance, which oftens renders his situation preferableto ours.Let us therefore beware of confounding savage man with the men, whomwe daily see and converse with. Nature behaves towards all animalsleft to her care with a predilection, that seems to prove how jealousshe is of that prerogative. The horse, the cat, the bull, nay the assitself, have generally a higher stature, and always a more robustconstitution, more vigour, more strength and courage in their foreststhan in our houses; they lose half these advantages by becomingdomestic animals; it looks as if all our attention to treat themkindly, and to feed them well, served only to bastardize them. It isthus with man himself. In proportion as he becomes sociable and aslave to others, he becomes weak, fearful, mean-spirited, and his softand effeminate way of living at once completes the enervation of hisstrength and of his courage. We may add, that there must be still awider difference between man and man in a savage and domesticcondition, than between beast and beast; for as men and beasts havebeen treated alike by nature, all the conveniences with which menindulge themselves more than they do the beasts tamed by them, are somany particular causes which make them degenerate more sensibly.Nakedness therefore, the want of houses, and of all theseunnecessaries, which we consider as so very necessary, are not suchmighty evils in respect to these primitive men, and much less stillany obstacle to their preservation. Their skins, it is true, aredestitute of hair; but then they have no occasion for any suchcovering in warm climates; and in cold climates they soon learn toapply to that use those of the animals they have conquered; they havebut two feet to run with, but they have two hands to defend themselveswith, and provide for all their wants; it costs them perhaps a greatdeal of time and trouble to make their children walk, but the motherscarry them with ease; an advantage not granted to other species ofanimals, with whom the mother, when pursued, is obliged to abandon heryoung ones, or regulate her steps by theirs. In short, unless we admitthose singular and fortuitous concurrences of circumstances, which Ishall speak of hereafter, and which, it is very possible, may neverhave existed, it is evident, in every state of the question, that theman, who first made himself clothes and built himself a cabin,supplied himself with things which he did not much want, since he hadlived without them till then; and why should he not have been able tosupport in his riper years, the same kind of life, which he hadsupported from his infancy?Alone, idle, and always surrounded with danger, savage man must befond of sleep, and sleep lightly like other animals, who think butlittle, and may, in a manner, be said to sleep all the time they donot think: self-preservation being almost his only concern, he mustexercise those faculties most, which are most serviceable in attackingand in defending, whether to subdue his prey, or to prevent hisbecoming that of other animals: those organs, on the contrary, whichsoftness and sensuality can alone improve, must remain in a state ofrudeness, utterly incompatible with all manner of delicacy; and as hissenses are divided on this point, his touch and his taste must beextremely coarse and blunt; his sight, his hearing, and his smellingequally subtle: such is the animal state in general, and accordinglyif we may believe travellers, it is that of most savage nations. Wemust not therefore be surprised, that the Hottentots of the Cape ofGood Hope, distinguish with their naked eyes ships on the ocean, at asgreat a distance as the Dutch can discern them with their glasses; northat the savages of America should have tracked the Spaniards withtheir noses, to as great a degree of exactness, as the best dogs couldhave done; nor that all these barbarous nations support nakednesswithout pain, use such large quantities of Piemento to give their fooda relish, and drink like water the strongest liquors of Europe.As yet I have considered man merely in his physical capacity; let usnow endeavour to examine him in a metaphysical and moral light.I can discover nothing in any mere animal but an ingenious machine, towhich nature has given senses to wind itself up, and guard, to acertain degree, against everything that might destroy or disorder it.I perceive the very same things in the human machine, with thisdifference, that nature alone operates in all the operations of thebeast, whereas man, as a free agent, has a share in his. One choosesby instinct; the other by an act of liberty; for which reason thebeast cannot deviate from the rules that have been prescribed to it,even in cases where such deviation might be useful, and man oftendeviates from the rules laid down for him to his prejudice. Thus apigeon would starve near a dish of the best flesh-meat, and a cat on aheap of fruit or corn, though both might very well support life withthe food which they thus disdain, did they but bethink themselves tomake a trial of it: it is in this manner dissolute men run intoexcesses, which bring on fevers and death itself; because the minddepraves the senses, and when nature ceases to speak, the will stillcontinues to dictate.All animals must be allowed to have ideas, since all animals havesenses; they even combine their ideas to a certain degree, and, inthis respect, it is only the difference of such degree, thatconstitutes the difference between man and beast: some philosophershave even advanced, that there is a greater difference between somemen and some others, than between some men and some beasts; it is nottherefore so much the understanding that constitutes, among animals,the specifical distinction of man, as his quality of a free agent.Nature speaks to all animals, and beasts obey her voice. Man feels thesame impression, but he at the same time perceives that he is free toresist or to acquiesce; and it is in the consciousness of thisliberty, that the spirituality of his soul chiefly appears: fornatural philosophy explains, in some measure, the mechanism of thesenses and the formation of ideas; but in the power of willing, orrather of choosing, and in the consciousness of this power, nothingcan be discovered but acts, that are purely spiritual, and cannot beaccounted for by the laws of mechanics.But though the difficulties, in which all these questions areinvolved, should leave some room to dispute on this difference betweenman and beast, there is another very specific quality thatdistinguishes them, and a quality which will admit of no dispute; thisis the faculty of improvement; a faculty which, as circumstancesoffer, successively unfolds all the other faculties, and resides amongus not only in the species, but in the individuals that compose it;whereas a beast is, at the end of some months, all he ever will beduring the rest of his life; and his species, at the end of a thousandyears, precisely what it was the first year of that long period. Whyis man alone subject to dotage? Is it not, because he thus returns tohis primitive condition? And because, while the beast, which hasacquired nothing and has likewise nothing to lose, continues always inpossession of his instinct, man, losing by old age, or by accident,all the acquisitions he had made in consequence of his perfectibility,thus falls back even lower than beasts themselves? It would be amelancholy necessity for us to be obliged to allow, that thisdistinctive and almost unlimited faculty is the source of all man'smisfortunes; that it is this faculty, which, though by slow degrees,draws them out of their original condition, in which his days wouldslide away insensibly in peace and innocence; that it is this faculty,which, in a succession of ages, produces his discoveries and mistakes,his virtues and his vices, and, at long run, renders him both his ownand nature's tyrant. It would be shocking to be obliged to commend, asa beneficent being, whoever he was that first suggested to the_Oronoco_ Indians the use of those boards which they bind on thetemples of their children, and which secure to them the enjoyment ofsome part at least of their natural imbecility and happiness.Savage man, abandoned by nature to pure instinct, or ratherindemnified for that which has perhaps been denied to him by facultiescapable of immediately supplying the place of it, and of raising himafterwards a great deal higher, would therefore begin with functionsthat were merely animal: to see and to feel would be his firstcondition, which he would enjoy in common with other animals. To willand not to will, to wish and to fear, would be the first, and in amanner, the only operations of his soul, till new circumstancesoccasioned new developments.Let moralists say what they will, the human understanding is greatlyindebted to the passions, which, on their side, are likewiseuniversally allowed to be greatly indebted to the human understanding.It is by the activity of our passions, that our reason improves: wecovet knowledge merely because we covet enjoyment, and it isimpossible to conceive why a man exempt from fears and desires shouldtake the trouble to reason. The passions, in their turn, owe theirorigin to our wants, and their increase to our progress in science;for we cannot desire or fear anything, but in consequence of the ideaswe have of it, or of the simple impulses of nature; and savage man,destitute of every species of knowledge, experiences no passions butthose of this last kind; his desires never extend beyond his physicalwants; he knows no goods but food, a female, and rest; he fears noevil but pain, and hunger; I say pain, and not death; for no animal,merely as such, will ever know what it is to die, and the knowledge ofdeath, and of its terrors, is one of the first acquisitions made byman, in consequence of his deviating from the animal state.I could easily, were it requisite, cite facts in support of thisopinion, and show, that the progress of the mind has everywhere keptpace exactly with the wants, to which nature had left the inhabitantsexposed, or to which circumstances had subjected them, andconsequently to the passions, which inclined them to provide for thesewants. I could exhibit in Egypt the arts starting up, and extendingthemselves with the inundations of the Nile; I could pursue them intheir progress among the Greeks, where they were seen to bud forth,grow, and rise to the heavens, in the midst of the sands and rocks ofAttica, without being able to take root on the fertile banks of theEurotas; I would observe that, in general, the inhabitants of thenorth are more industrious than those of the south, because they canless do without industry; as if nature thus meant to make all thingsequal, by giving to the mind that fertility she has denied to thesoil.But exclusive of the uncertain testimonies of history, who does notperceive that everything seems to remove from savage man thetemptation and the means of altering his condition? His imaginationpaints nothing to him; his heart asks nothing from him. His moderatewants are so easily supplied with what he everywhere finds ready tohis hand, and he stands at such a distance from the degree ofknowledge requisite to covet more, that he can neither have foresightnor curiosity. The spectacle of nature, by growing quite familiar tohim, becomes at last equally indifferent. It is constantly the sameorder, constantly the same revolutions; he has not sense enough tofeel surprise at the sight of the greatest wonders; and it is not inhis mind we must look for that philosophy, which man must have to knowhow to observe once, what he has every day seen. His soul, whichnothing disturbs, gives itself up entirely to the consciousness of itsactual existence, without any thought of even the nearest futurity;and his projects, equally confined with his views, scarce extend tothe end of the day. Such is, even at present, the degree of foresightin the Caribbean: he sells his cotton bed in the morning, and comes inthe evening, with tears in his eyes, to buy it back, not havingforeseen that he should want it again the next night.The more we meditate on this subject, the wider does the distancebetween mere sensation and the most simple knowledge become in oureyes; and it is impossible to conceive how man, by his own powersalone, without the assistance of communication, and the spur ofnecessity, could have got over so great an interval. How many agesperhaps revolved, before men beheld any other fire but that of theheavens? How many different accidents must have concurred to make themacquainted with the most common uses of this element? How often havethey let it go out, before they knew the art of reproducing it? Andhow often perhaps has not every one of these secrets perished with thediscoverer? What shall we say of agriculture, an art which requires somuch labour and foresight; which depends upon other arts; which, it isvery evident, cannot be practised but in a society, if not a formedone, at least one of some standing, and which does not so much serveto draw aliments from the earth, for the earth would yield themwithout all that trouble, as to oblige her to produce those things,which we like best, preferably to others? But let us suppose that menhad multiplied to such a degree, that the natural products of theearth no longer sufficed for their support; a supposition which, bythe bye, would prove that this kind of life would be very advantageousto the human species; let us suppose that, without forge or anvil, theinstruments of husbandry had dropped from the heavens into the handsof savages, that these men had got the better of that mortal aversionthey all have for constant labour; that they had learned to foretelltheir wants at so great a distance of time; that they had guessedexactly how they were to break the earth, commit their seed to it, andplant trees; that they had found out the art of grinding their corn,and improving by fermentation the juice of their grapes; alloperations which we must allow them to have learned from the gods,since we cannot conceive how they should make such discoveries ofthemselves; after all these fine presents, what man would be madenough to cultivate a field, that may be robbed by the first comer,man or beast, who takes a fancy to the produce of it. And would anyman consent to spend his day in labour and fatigue, when the rewardsof his labour and fatigue became more and more precarious inproportion to his want of them? In a word, how could this situationengage men to cultivate the earth, as long as it was not parcelled outamong them, that is, as long as a state of nature subsisted.Though we should suppose savage man as well versed in the art ofthinking, as philosophers make him; though we were, after them, tomake him a philosopher himself, discovering of himself the sublimesttruths, forming to himself, by the most abstract arguments, maxims ofjustice and reason drawn from the love of order in general, or fromthe known will of his Creator: in a word, though we were to supposehis mind as intelligent and enlightened, as it must, and is, in fact,found to be dull and stupid; what benefit would the species receivefrom all these metaphysical discoveries, which could not becommunicated, but must perish with the individual who had made them?What progress could mankind make in the forests, scattered up and downamong the other animals? And to what degree could men mutually improveand enlighten each other, when they had no fixed habitation, nor anyneed of each other's assistance; when the same persons scarcely mettwice in their whole lives, and on meeting neither spoke to, or somuch as knew each other?Let us consider how many ideas we owe to the use of speech; how muchgrammar exercises, and facilitates the operations of the mind; let us,besides, reflect on the immense pains and time that the firstinvention of languages must have required: Let us add thesereflections to the preceding; and then we may judge how many thousandages must have been requisite to develop successively the operations,which the human mind is capable of producing.I must now beg leave to stop one moment to consider the perplexitiesattending the origin of languages. I might here barely cite or repeatthe researches made, in relation to this question, by the Abbe deCondillac, which all fully confirm my system, and perhaps evensuggested to me the first idea of it. But, as the manner, in which thephilosopher resolves the difficulties of his own starting, concerningthe origin of arbitrary signs, shows that he supposes, what I doubt,namely a kind of society already established among the inventors oflanguages; I think it my duty, at the same time that I refer to hisreflections, to give my own, in order to expose the same difficultiesin a light suitable to my subject. The first that offers is howlanguages could become necessary; for as there was no correspondencebetween men, nor the least necessity for any, there is no conceivingthe necessity of this invention, nor the possibility of it, if it wasnot indispensable. I might say, with many others, that languages arethe fruit of the domestic intercourse between fathers, mothers, andchildren: but this, besides its not answering any difficulties, wouldbe committing the same fault with those, who reasoning on the state ofnature, transfer to it ideas collected in society, always considerfamilies as living together under one roof, and their members asobserving among themselves an union, equally intimate and permanentwith that which we see exist in a civil state, where so many commoninterests conspire to unite them; whereas in this primitive state, asthere were neither houses nor cabins, nor any kind of property, everyone took up his lodging at random, and seldom continued above onenight in the same place; males and females united without anypremeditated design, as chance, occasion, or desire brought themtogether, nor had they any great occasion for language to make knowntheir thoughts to each other. They parted with the same ease. Themother suckled her children, when just born, for her own sake; butafterwards out of love and affection to them, when habit and customhad made them dear to her; but they no sooner gained strength enoughto run about in quest of food than they separated even from her oftheir own accord; and as they scarce had any other method of notlosing each other, than that of remaining constantly in each other'ssight, they soon came to such a pass of forgetfulness, as not even toknow each other, when they happened to meet again. I must furtherobserve that the child having all his wants to explain, andconsequently more things to say to his mother, than the mother canhave to say to him, it is he that must be at the chief expense ofinvention, and the language he makes use of must be in a great measurehis own work; this makes the number of languages equal to that of theindividuals who are to speak them; and this multiplicity of languagesis further increased by their roving and vagabond kind of life, whichallows no idiom time enough to acquire any consistency; for to saythat the mother would have dictated to the child the words he mustemploy to ask her this thing and that, may well enough explain in whatmanner languages, already formed, are taught, but it does not show usin what manner they are first formed.Let us suppose this first difficulty conquered: Let us for a momentconsider ourselves at this side of the immense space, which must haveseparated the pure state of nature from that in which languages becamenecessary, and let us, after allowing such necessity, examine howlanguages could begin to be established. A new difficulty this, stillmore stubborn than the preceding; for if men stood in need of speechto learn to think, they must have stood in still greater need of theart of thinking to invent that of speaking; and though we couldconceive how the sounds of the voice came to be taken for theconventional interpreters of our ideas we should not be the nearerknowing who could have been the interpreters of this convention forsuch ideas, as, in consequence of their not having any sensibleobjects, could not be made manifest by gesture or voice; so that wecan scarce form any tolerable conjectures concerning the birth of thisart of communicating our thoughts, and establishing a correspondencebetween minds: a sublime art which, though so remote from its origin,philosophers still behold at such a prodigious distance from itsperfection, that I never met with one of them bold enough to affirm itwould ever arrive there, though the revolutions necessarily producedby time were suspended in its favour; though prejudice could bebanished from, or would be at least content to sit silent in thepresence of our academies, and though these societies shouldconsecrate themselves, entirely and during whole ages, to the study ofthis intricate object.The first language of man, the most universal and most energetic ofall languages, in short, the only language he had occasion for, beforethere was a necessity of persuading assembled multitudes, was the cryof nature. As this cry was never extorted but by a kind of instinct inthe most urgent cases, to implore assistance in great danger, orrelief in great sufferings, it was of little use in the commonoccurrences of life, where more moderate sentiments generally prevail.When the ideas of men began to extend and multiply, and a closercommunication began to take place among them, they laboured to devisemore numerous signs, and a more extensive language: they multipliedthe inflections of the voice, and added to them gestures, which are,in their own nature, more expressive, and whose meaning depends lesson any prior determination. They therefore expressed visible andmovable objects by gestures and those which strike the ear, byimitative sounds: but as gestures scarcely indicate anything exceptobjects that are actually present or can be easily described, andvisible actions; as they are not of general use, since darkness or theinterposition of an opaque medium renders them useless; and as besidesthey require attention rather than excite it: men at length bethoughtthemselves of substituting for them the articulations of voice, which,without having the same relation to any determinate object, are, inquality of instituted signs, fitter to represent all our ideas; asubstitution, which could only have been made by common consent, andin a manner pretty difficult to practise by men, whose rude organswere unimproved by exercise; a substitution, which is in itself moredifficult to be conceived, since the motives to this unanimousagreement must have been somehow or another expressed, and speechtherefore appears to have been exceedingly requisite to establish theuse of speech.We must allow that the words, first made use of by men, had in theirminds a much more extensive signification, than those employed inlanguages of some standing, and that, considering how ignorant theywere of the division of speech into its constituent parts; they atfirst gave every word the meaning of an entire proposition. Whenafterwards they began to perceive the difference between the subjectand attribute, and between verb and noun, a distinction which requiredno mean effort of genius, the substantives for a time were only somany proper names, the infinitive was the only tense, and as toadjectives, great difficulties must have attended the development ofthe idea that represents them, since every adjective is an abstractword, and abstraction is an unnatural and very painful operation.At first they gave every object a peculiar name, without any regard toits genus or species, things which these first institutors of languagewere in no condition to distinguish; and every individual presenteditself solitary to their minds, as it stands in the table of nature.If they called one oak A, they called another oak B: so that theirdictionary must have been more extensive in proportion as theirknowledge of things was more confined. It could not but be a verydifficult task to get rid of so diffuse and embarrassing anomenclature; as in order to marshal the several beings under commonand generic denominations, it was necessary to be first acquaintedwith their properties, and their differences; to be stocked withobservations and definitions, that is to say, to understand naturalhistory and metaphysics, advantages which the men of these times couldnot have enjoyed.Besides, general ideas cannot be conveyed to the mind without theassistance of words, nor can the understanding seize them without theassistance of propositions. This is one of the reasons, why mereanimals cannot form such ideas, nor ever acquire the perfectibilitywhich depends on such an operation. When a monkey leaves without theleast hesitation one nut for another, are we to think he has anygeneral idea of that kind of fruit, and that he compares these twoindividual bodies with his archetype notion of them? No, certainly;but the sight of one of these nuts calls back to his memory thesensations which he has received from the other; and his eyes,modified after some certain manner, give notice to his palate of themodification it is in its turn going to receive. Every general idea ispurely intellectual; let the imagination tamper ever so little withit, it immediately becomes a particular idea. Endeavour to representto yourself the image of a tree in general, you never will be able todo it; in spite of all your efforts it will appear big or little, thinor tufted, of a bright or a deep colour; and were you master to seenothing in it, but what can be seen in every tree, such a picturewould no longer resemble any tree. Beings perfectly abstract areperceivable in the same manner, or are only conceivable by theassistance of speech. The definition of a triangle can alone give youa just idea of that figure: the moment you form a triangle in yourmind, it is this or that particular triangle and no other, and youcannot avoid giving breadth to its lines and colour to its area. Wemust therefore make use of propositions; we must therefore speak tohave general ideas; for the moment the imagination stops, the mindmust stop too, if not assisted by speech. If therefore the firstinventors could give no names to any ideas but those they had already,it follows that the first substantives could never have been anythingmore than proper names.But when by means, which I cannot conceive, our new grammarians beganto extend their ideas, and generalize their words, the ignorance ofthe inventors must have confined this method to very narrow bounds;and as they had at first too much multiplied the names of individualsfor want of being acquainted with the distinctions called genus andspecies, they afterwards made too few genera and species for want ofhaving considered beings in all their differences; to push thedivisions far enough, they must have had more knowledge and experiencethan we can allow them, and have made more researches and taken morepains, than we can suppose them willing to submit to. Now if, even atthis present time, we every day discover new species, which had beforeescaped all our observations, how many species must have escaped thenotice of men, who judged of things merely from their firstappearances! As to the primitive classes and the most general notions,it were superfluous to add that these they must have likewiseoverlooked: how, for example, could they have thought of or understoodthe words, matter, spirit, substance, mode, figure, motion, since evenour philosophers, who for so long a time have been constantlyemploying these terms, can themselves scarcely understand them, andsince the ideas annexed to these words being purely metaphysical, nomodels of them could be found in nature?I stop at these first advances, and beseech my judges to suspend theirlecture a little, in order to consider, what a great way language hasstill to go, in regard to the invention of physical substantivesalone, (though the easiest part of language to invent,) to be able toexpress all the sentiments of man, to assume an invariable form, tobear being spoken in public and to influence society: I earnestlyentreat them to consider how much time and knowledge must have beenrequisite to find out numbers, abstract words, the aorists, and allthe other tenses of verbs, the particles, and syntax, the method ofconnecting propositions and arguments, of forming all the logic ofdiscourse. For my own part, I am so scared at the difficulties thatmultiply at every step, and so convinced of the almost demonstratedimpossibility of languages owing their birth and establishment tomeans that were merely human, that I must leave to whoever may pleaseto take it up, the task of discussing this difficult problem. \"Whichwas the most necessary, society already formed to invent languages, orlanguages already invented to form society?\"But be the case of these origins ever so mysterious, we may at leastinfer from the little care which nature has taken to bring mentogether by mutual wants, and make the use of speech easy to them, howlittle she has done towards making them sociable, and how little shehas contributed to anything which they themselves have done to becomeso. In fact, it is impossible to conceive, why, in this primitivestate, one man should have more occasion for the assistance ofanother, than one monkey, or one wolf for that of another animal ofthe same species; or supposing that he had, what motive could induceanother to assist him; or even, in this last case, how he, who wantedassistance, and he from whom it was wanted, could agree amongthemselves upon the conditions. Authors, I know, are continuallytelling us, that in this state man would have been a most miserablecreature; and if it is true, as I fancy I have proved it, that he musthave continued many ages without either the desire or the opportunityof emerging from such a state, this their assertion could only serveto justify a charge against nature, and not any against the beingwhich nature had thus constituted; but, if I thoroughly understandthis term miserable, it is a word, that either has no meaning, orsignifies nothing, but a privation attended with pain, and a sufferingstate of body or soul; now I would fain know what kind of misery canbe that of a free being, whose heart enjoys perfect peace, and bodyperfect health? And which is aptest to become insupportable to thosewho enjoy it, a civil or a natural life? In civil life we can scarcelymeet a single person who does not complain of his existence; many eventhrow away as much of it as they can, and the united force of divineand human laws can hardly put bounds to this disorder. Was ever anyfree savage known to have been so much as tempted to complain of life,and lay violent hands on himself? Let us therefore judge with lesspride on which side real misery is to be placed. Nothing, on thecontrary, must have been so unhappy as savage man, dazzled by flashesof knowledge, racked by passions, and reasoning on a state differentfrom that in which he saw himself placed. It was in consequence of avery wise Providence, that the faculties, which he potentiallyenjoyed, were not to develop themselves but in proportion as thereoffered occasions to exercise them, lest they should be superfluous ortroublesome to him when he did not want them, or tardy and uselesswhen he did. He had in his instinct alone everything requisite to livein a state of nature; in his cultivated reason he has barely what isnecessary to live in a state of society.It appears at first sight that, as there was no kind of moralrelations between men in this state, nor any known duties, they couldnot be either good or bad, and had neither vices nor virtues, unlesswe take these words in a physical sense, and call vices, in theindividual, the qualities which may prove detrimental to his ownpreservation, and virtues those which may contribute to it; in whichcase we should be obliged to consider him as most virtuous, who madeleast resistance against the simple impulses of nature. But withoutdeviating from the usual meaning of these terms, it is proper tosuspend the judgment we might form of such a situation, and be uponour guard against prejudice, till, the balance in hand, we haveexamined whether there are more virtues or vices among civilized men;or whether the improvement of their understanding is sufficient tocompensate the damage which they mutually do to each other, inproportion as they become better informed of the services which theyought to do; or whether, upon the whole, they would not be muchhappier in a condition, where they had nothing to fear or to hope fromeach other, than in that where they had submitted to an universalsubserviency, and have obliged themselves to depend for everythingupon the good will of those, who do not think themselves obliged togive anything in return.But above all things let us beware concluding with Hobbes, that man,as having no idea of goodness, must be naturally bad; that he isvicious because he does not know what virtue is; that he alwaysrefuses to do any service to those of his own species, because hebelieves that none is due to them; that, in virtue of that right whichhe justly claims to everything he wants, he foolishly looks uponhimself as proprietor of the whole universe. Hobbes very plainly sawthe flaws in all the modern definitions of natural right: but theconsequences, which he draws from his own definition, show that it is,in the sense he understands it, equally exceptionable. This author, toargue from his own principles, should say that the state of nature,being that where the care of our own preservation interferes leastwith the preservation of others, was of course the most favourable topeace, and most suitable to mankind; whereas he advances the veryreverse in consequence of his having injudiciously admitted, asobjects of that care which savage man should take of his preservation,the satisfaction of numberless passions which are the work of society,and have rendered laws necessary. A bad man, says he, is a robustchild. But this is not proving that savage man is a robust child; andthough we were to grant that he was, what could this philosopher inferfrom such a concession? That if this man, when robust, depended onothers as much as when feeble, there is no excess that he would not beguilty of. He would make nothing of striking his mother when shedelayed ever so little to give him the breast; he would claw, andbite, and strangle without remorse the first of his younger brothers,that ever so accidentally jostled or otherwise disturbed him. Butthese are two contradictory suppositions in the state of nature, to berobust and dependent. Man is weak when dependent, and his own masterbefore he grows robust. Hobbes did not consider that the same cause,which hinders savages from making use of their reason, as ourjurisconsults pretend, hinders them at the same time from making anill use of their faculties, as he himself pretends; so that we may saythat savages are not bad, precisely because they don't know what it isto be good; for it is neither the development of the understanding,nor the curb of the law, but the calmness of their passions and theirignorance of vice that hinders them from doing ill: _tantus plus inillis proficit vitiorum ignorantia, quam in his cognito virtutis_.There is besides another principle that has escaped Hobbes, and which,having been given to man to moderate, on certain occasions, the blindand impetuous sallies of self-love, or the desire of self-preservationprevious to the appearance of that passion, allays the ardour, withwhich he naturally pursues his private welfare, by an innateabhorrence to see beings suffer that resemble him. I shall not surelybe contradicted, in granting to man the only natural virtue, which themost passionate detractor of human virtues could not deny him, I meanthat of pity, a disposition suitable to creatures weak as we are, andliable to so many evils; a virtue so much the more universal, andwithal useful to man, as it takes place in him of all manner ofreflection; and so natural, that the beasts themselves sometimes giveevident signs of it. Not to speak of the tenderness of mothers fortheir young; and of the dangers they face to screen them from danger;with what reluctance are horses known to trample upon living bodies;one animal never passes unmoved by the dead carcass of another animalof the same species: there are even some who bestow a kind ofsepulture upon their dead fellows; and the mournful lowings of cattle,on their entering the slaughter-house, publish the impression madeupon them by the horrible spectacle they are there struck with. It iswith pleasure we see the author of the fable of the bees, forced toacknowledge man a compassionate and sensible being; and lay aside, inthe example he offers to confirm it, his cold and subtle style, toplace before us the pathetic picture of a man, who, with his handstied up, is obliged to behold a beast of prey tear a child from thearms of his mother, and then with his teeth grind the tender limbs,and with his claws rend the throbbing entrails of the innocent victim.What horrible emotions must not such a spectator experience at thesight of an event which does not personally concern him? What anguishmust he not suffer at his not being able to assist the fainting motheror the expiring infant?Such is the pure motion of nature, anterior to all manner ofreflection; such is the force of natural pity, which the mostdissolute manners have as yet found it so difficult to extinguish,since we every day see, in our theatrical representation, those mensympathize with the unfortunate and weep at their sufferings, who, ifin the tyrant's place, would aggravate the torments of their enemies.Mandeville was very sensible that men, in spite of all their morality,would never have been better than monsters, if nature had not giventhem pity to assist reason: but he did not perceive that from thisquality alone flow all the social virtues, which he would disputemankind the possession of. In fact, what is generosity, what clemency,what humanity, but pity applied to the weak, to the guilty, or to thehuman species in general? Even benevolence and friendship, if we judgeright, will appear the effects of a constant pity, fixed upon aparticular object: for to wish that a person may not suffer, what isit but to wish that he may be happy? Though it were true thatcommiseration is no more than a sentiment, which puts us in the placeof him who suffers, a sentiment obscure but active in the savage,developed but dormant in civilized man, how could this notion affectthe truth of what I advance, but to make it more evident. In fact,commiseration must be so much the more energetic, the more intimatelythe animal, that beholds any kind of distress, identifies himself withthe animal that labours under it. Now it is evident that thisidentification must have been infinitely more perfect in the state ofnature than in the state of reason. It is reason that engendersself-love, and reflection that strengthens it; it is reason that makesman shrink into himself; it is reason that makes him keep aloof fromeverything that can trouble or afflict him: it is philosophy thatdestroys his connections with other men; it is in consequence of herdictates that he mutters to himself at the sight of another indistress, You may perish for aught I care, nothing can hurt me.Nothing less than those evils, which threaten the whole species, candisturb the calm sleep of the philosopher, and force him from his bed.One man may with impunity murder another under his windows; he hasnothing to do but clap his hands to his ears, argue a little withhimself to hinder nature, that startles within him, from identifyinghim with the unhappy sufferer. Savage man wants this admirable talent;and for want of wisdom and reason, is always ready foolishly to obeythe first whispers of humanity. In riots and street-brawls thepopulace flock together, the prudent man sneaks off. They are thedregs of the people, the poor basket and barrow-women, that part thecombatants, and hinder gentle folks from cutting one another'sthroats.It is therefore certain that pity is a natural sentiment, which, bymoderating in every individual the activity of self-love, contributesto the mutual preservation of the whole species. It is this pitywhich hurries us without reflection to the assistance of those we seein distress; it is this pity which, in a state of nature, stands forlaws, for manners, for virtue, with this advantage, that no one istempted to disobey her sweet and gentle voice: it is this pity whichwill always hinder a robust savage from plundering a feeble child, orinfirm old man, of the subsistence they have acquired with pain anddifficulty, if he has but the least prospect of providing for himselfby any other means: it is this pity which, instead of that sublimemaxim of argumentative justice, Do to others as you would have othersdo to you, inspires all men with that other maxim of natural goodnessa great deal less perfect, but perhaps more useful, Consult your ownhappiness with as little prejudice as you can to that of others. It isin a word, in this natural sentiment, rather than in fine-spunarguments, that we must look for the cause of that reluctance whichevery man would experience to do evil, even independently of themaxims of education. Though it may be the peculiar happiness ofSocrates and other geniuses of his stamp, to reason themselves intovirtue, the human species would long ago have ceased to exist, had itdepended entirely for its preservation on the reasonings of theindividuals that compose it.With passions so tame, and so salutary a curb, men, rather wild thanwicked, and more attentive to guard against mischief than to do any toother animals, were not exposed to any dangerous dissensions: As theykept up no manner of correspondence with each other, and were ofcourse strangers to vanity, to respect, to esteem, to contempt; asthey had no notion of what we call Meum and Tuum, nor any true idea ofjustice; as they considered any violence they were liable to, as anevil that could be easily repaired, and not as an injury that deservedpunishment; and as they never so much as dreamed of revenge, unlessperhaps mechanically and unpremeditatedly, as a dog who bites thestone that has been thrown at him; their disputes could seldom beattended with bloodshed, were they never occasioned by a moreconsiderable stake than that of subsistence: but there is a moredangerous subject of contention, which I must not leave unnoticed.Among the passions which ruffle the heart of man, there is one of ahot and impetuous nature, which renders the sexes necessary to eachother; a terrible passion which despises all dangers, bears down allobstacles, and to which in its transports it seems proper to destroythe human species which it is destined to preserve. What must becomeof men abandoned to this lawless and brutal rage, without modesty,without shame, and every day disputing the objects of their passion atthe expense of their blood?We must in the first place allow that the more violent the passions,the more necessary are laws to restrain them: but besides that thedisorders and the crimes, to which these passions daily give riseamong us, sufficiently grove the insufficiency of laws for thatpurpose, we would do well to look back a little further and examine,if these evils did not spring up with the laws themselves; for at thisrate, though the laws were capable of repressing these evils, it isthe least that might be expected from them, seeing it is no more thanstopping the progress of a mischief which they themselves haveproduced.Let us begin by distinguishing between what is moral and what isphysical in the passion called love. The physical part of it is thatgeneral desire which prompts the sexes to unite with each other; themoral part is that which determines that desire, and fixes it upon aparticular object to the exclusion of all others, or at least gives ita greater degree of energy for this preferred object. Now it is easyto perceive that the moral part of love is a factitious sentiment,engendered by society, and cried up by the women with great care andaddress in order to establish their empire, and secure command to thatsex which ought to obey. This sentiment, being founded on certainnotions of beauty and merit which a savage is not capable of having,and upon comparisons which he is not capable of making, can scarcelyexist in him: for as his mind was never in a condition to formabstract ideas of regularity and proportion, neither is his heartsusceptible of sentiments of admiration and love, which, even withoutour perceiving it, are produced by our application of these ideas; helistens solely to the dispositions implanted in him by nature, and notto taste which he never was in a way of acquiring; and every womananswers his purpose.Confined entirely to what is physical in love, and happy enough not toknow these preferences which sharpen the appetite for it, at the sametime that they increase the difficulty of satisfying such appetite,men, in a state of nature, must be subject to fewer and less violentfits of that passion, and of course there must be fewer and lessviolent disputes among them in consequence of it. The imaginationwhich causes so many ravages among us, never speaks to the heart ofsavages, who peaceably wait for the impulses of nature, yield to theseimpulses without choice and with more pleasure than fury; and whosedesires never outlive their necessity for the thing desired.Nothing therefore can be more evident, than that it is society alone,which has added even to love itself as well as to all the otherpassions, that impetuous ardour, which so often renders it fatal tomankind; and it is so much the more ridiculous to represent savagesconstantly murdering each other to glut their brutality, as thisopinion is diametrically opposite to experience, and the Caribbeans,the people in the world who have as yet deviated least from the stateof nature, are to all intents and purposes the most peaceable in theiramours, and the least subject to jealousy, though they live in aburning climate which seems always to add considerably to the activityof these passions.As to the inductions which may be drawn, in respect to several speciesof animals, from the battles of the males, who in all seasons coverour poultry yards with blood, and in spring particularly cause ourforests to ring again with the noise they make in disputing theirfemales, we must begin by excluding all those species, where naturehas evidently established, in the relative power of the sexes,relations different from those which exist among us: thus from thebattle of cocks we can form no induction that will affect the humanspecies. In the species, where the proportion is better observed,these battles must be owing entirely to the fewness of the femalescompared with the males, or, which is all one, to the exclusiveintervals, during which the females constantly refuse the addresses ofthe males; for if the female admits the male but two months in theyear, it is all the same as if the number of females were five-sixthsless than what it is: now neither of these cases is applicable to thehuman species, where the number of females generally surpasses that ofmales, and where it has never been observed that, even among savages,the females had, like those of other animals, stated times of passionand indifference, Besides, among several of these animals the wholespecies takes fire all at once, and for some days nothing is, to beseen among them but confusion, tumult, disorder and bloodshed; a stateunknown to the human species where love is never periodical. We cannot therefore conclude from the battles of certain animals for thepossession of their females, that the same would be the case of man ina state of nature; and though we might, as these contests do notdestroy the other species, there is at least equal room to think theywould not be fatal to ours; nay it is very probable that they wouldcause fewer ravages than they do in society, especially in thosecountries where, morality being as yet held in some esteem, thejealousy of lovers, and the vengeance of husbands every day produceduels, murders and even worse crimes; where the duty of an eternalfidelity serves only to propagate adultery; and the very laws ofcontinence and honour necessarily contribute to increasedissoluteness, and multiply abortions.Let us conclude that savage man, wandering about in the forests,without industry, without speech, without any fixed residence, anequal stranger to war and every social connection, without standing inany shape in need of his fellows, as well as without any desire ofhurting them, and perhaps even without ever distinguishing themindividually one from the other, subject to few passions, and findingin himself all he wants, let us, I say, conclude that savage man thuscircumstanced had no knowledge or sentiment but such as are proper tothat condition, that he was alone sensible of his real necessities,took notice of nothing but what it was his interest to see, and thathis understanding made as little progress as his vanity. If hehappened to make any discovery, he could the less communicate it as hedid not even know his children. The art perished with the inventor;there was neither education nor improvement; generations succeededgenerations to no purpose; and as all constantly set out from the samepoint, whole centuries rolled on in the rudeness and barbarity of thefirst age; the species was grown old, while the individual stillremained in a state of childhood.If I have enlarged so much upon the supposition of this primitivecondition, it is because I thought it my duty, considering whatancient errors and inveterate prejudices I have to extirpate, to digto the very roots, and show in a true picture of the state of nature,how much even natural inequality falls short in this state of thatreality and influence which our writers ascribe to it.In fact, we may easily perceive that among the differences, whichdistinguish men, several pass for natural, which are merely the workof habit and the different kinds of life adopted by men living in asocial way. Thus a robust or delicate constitution, and the strengthand weakness which depend on it, are oftener produced by the hardy oreffeminate manner in which a man has been brought up, than by theprimitive constitution of his body. It is the same thus in regard tothe forces of the mind; and education not only produces a differencebetween those minds which are cultivated and those which are not, buteven increases that which is found among the first in proportion totheir culture; for let a giant and a dwarf set out in the same path,the giant at every step will acquire a new advantage over the dwarf.Now, if we compare the prodigious variety in the education and mannerof living of the different orders of men in a civil state, with thesimplicity and uniformity that prevails in the animal and savage life,where all the individuals make use of the same aliments, live in thesame manner, and do exactly the same things, we shall easily conceivehow much the difference between man and man in the state of naturemust be less than in the state of society, and how much everyinequality of institution must increase the natural inequalities ofthe human species.But though nature in the distribution of her gifts should reallyaffect all the preferences that are ascribed to her, what advantagecould the most favoured derive from her partiality, to the prejudiceof others, in a state of things, which scarce admitted any kind ofrelation between her pupils? Of what service can beauty be, wherethere is no love? What will wit avail people who don't speak, or craftthose who have no affairs to transact? Authors are constantly cryingout, that the strongest would oppress the weakest; but let themexplain what they mean by the word oppression. One man will rule withviolence, another will groan under a constant subjection to all hiscaprices: this is indeed precisely what I observe among us, but Idon't see how it can be said of savage men, into whose heads it wouldbe a harder matter to drive even the meaning of the words dominationand servitude. One man might, indeed, seize on the fruits whichanother had gathered, on the game which another had killed, on thecavern which another had occupied for shelter; but how is it possiblehe should ever exact obedience from him, and what chains of dependencecan there be among men who possess nothing? If I am driven from onetree, I have nothing to do but look out for another; if one place ismade uneasy to me, what can hinder me from taking up my quarterselsewhere? But suppose I should meet a man so much superior to me instrength, and withal so wicked, so lazy and so barbarous as to obligeme to provide for his subsistence while he remains idle; he mustresolve not to take his eyes from me a single moment, to bind me fastbefore he can take the least nap, lest I should kill him or give himthe slip during his sleep: that is to say, he must expose himselfvoluntarily to much greater troubles than what he seeks to avoid, thanany he gives me. And after all, let him abate ever so little of hisvigilance; let him at some sudden noise but turn his head another way;I am already buried in the forest, my fetters are broke, and he neversees me again.But without insisting any longer upon these details, every one mustsee that, as the bonds of servitude are formed merely by the mutualdependence of men one upon another and the reciprocal necessitieswhich unite them, it is impossible for one man to enslave another,without having first reduced him to a condition in which he can notlive without the enslaver's assistance; a condition which, as it doesnot exist in a state of nature, must leave every man his own master,and render the law of the strongest altogether vain and useless.Having proved that the inequality, which may subsist between man andman in a state of nature, is almost imperceivable, and that it hasvery little influence, I must now proceed to show its origin, andtrace its progress, in the successive developments of the human mind.After having showed, that perfectibility, the social virtues, and theother faculties, which natural man had received _in potentia_, couldnever be developed of themselves, that for that purpose there was anecessity for the fortuitous concurrence of several foreign causes,which might never happen, and without which he must have eternallyremained in his primitive condition; I must proceed to consider andbring together the different accidents which may have perfected thehuman understanding by debasing the species, render a being wicked byrendering him sociable, and from so remote a term bring man at lastand the world to the point in which we now see them.I must own that, as the events I am about to describe might havehappened many different ways, my choice of these I shall assign can begrounded on nothing but mere conjecture; but besides these conjecturesbecoming reasons, when they are not only the most probable that can bedrawn from the nature of things, but the only means we can have ofdiscovering truth, the consequences I mean to deduce from mine willnot be merely conjectural, since, on the principles I have justestablished, it is impossible to form any other system, that would notsupply me with the same results, and from which I might not draw thesame conclusions.This will authorize me to be the more concise in my reflections on themanner, in which the lapse of time makes amends for the littleverisimilitude of events; on the surprising power of very trivialcauses, when they act without intermission; on the impossibility thereis on the one hand of destroying certain Hypotheses, if on the otherwe can not give them the degree of certainty which facts must beallowed to possess; on its being the business of history, when twofacts are proposed, as real, to be connected by a chain ofintermediate facts which are either unknown or considered as such, tofurnish such facts as may actually connect them; and the business ofphilosophy, when history is silent, to point out similar facts whichmay answer the same purpose; in fine on the privilege of similitude,in regard to events, to reduce facts to a much smaller number ofdifferent classes than is generally imagined. It suffices me to offerthese objects to the consideration of my judges; it suffices me tohave conducted my inquiry in such a manner as to save common readersthe trouble of considering them.SECOND PARTThe first man, who, after enclosing a piece of ground, took it intohis head to say, \"This is mine,\" and found people simple enough tobelieve him, was the true founder of civil society. How many crimes,how many wars, how many murders, how many misfortunes and horrors,would that man have saved the human species, who pulling up the stakesor filling up the ditches should have cried to his fellows: Be surenot to listen to this imposter; you are lost, if you forget that thefruits of the earth belong equally to us all, and the earth itself tonobody! But it is highly probable that things were now come to such apass, that they could not continue much longer in the same way; for asthis idea of property depends on several prior ideas which could onlyspring up gradually one after another, it was not formed all at oncein the human mind: men must have made great progress; they must haveacquired a great stock of industry and knowledge, and transmitted andincreased it from age to age before they could arrive at this lastterm of the state of nature. Let us therefore take up things a littlehigher, and collect into one point of view, and in their most naturalorder, this slow succession of events and mental improvements.The first sentiment of man was that of his existence, his first carethat of preserving it. The productions of the earth yielded him allthe assistance he required; instinct prompted him to make use of them.Among the various appetites, which made him at different timesexperience different modes of existence, there was one that excitedhim to perpetuate his species; and this blind propensity, quite voidof anything like pure love or affection, produced nothing but an actthat was merely animal. The present heat once allayed, the sexes tookno further notice of each other, and even the child ceased to have anytie in his mother, the moment he ceased to want her assistance.Such was the condition of infant man; such was the life of an animalconfined at first to pure sensations, and so far from harbouring anythought of forcing her gifts from nature, that he scarcely availedhimself of those which she offered to him of her own accord. Butdifficulties soon arose, and there was a necessity for learning how tosurmount them: the height of some trees, which prevented his reachingtheir fruits; the competition of other animals equally fond of thesame fruits; the fierceness of many that even aimed at his life; thesewere so many circumstances, which obliged him to apply to bodilyexercise. There was a necessity for becoming active, swift-footed, andsturdy in battle. The natural arms, which are stones and the branchesof trees, soon offered themselves to his assistance. He learned tosurmount the obstacles of nature, to contend in case of necessity withother animals, to dispute his subsistence even with other men, orindemnify himself for the loss of whatever he found himself obliged topart with to the strongest.In proportion as the human species grew more numerous, and extendeditself, its pains likewise multiplied and increased. The differenceof soils, climates and seasons, might have forced men to observe somedifference in their way of living. Bad harvests, long and severewinters, and scorching summers which parched up all the fruits of theearth, required extraordinary exertions of industry. On the sea shore,and the banks of rivers, they invented the line and the hook, andbecame fishermen and ichthyophagous. In the forests they madethemselves bows and arrows, and became huntsmen and warriors. In thecold countries they covered themselves with the skins of the beaststhey had killed; thunder, a volcano, or some happy accident made themacquainted with fire, a new resource against the rigours of winter:they discovered the method of preserving this element, then that ofreproducing it, and lastly the way of preparing with it the flesh ofanimals, which heretofore they devoured raw from the carcass.This reiterated application of various beings to himself, and to oneanother, must have naturally engendered in the mind of man the idea ofcertain relations. These relations, which we express by the words,great, little, strong, weak, swift, slow, fearful, bold, and the like,compared occasionally, and almost without thinking of it, produced inhim some kind of reflection, or rather a mechanical prudence, whichpointed out to him the precautions most essential to his preservationand safety.The new lights resulting from this development increased hissuperiority over other animals, by making him sensible of it. He laidhimself out to ensnare them; he played them a thousand tricks; andthough several surpassed him in strength or in swiftness, he in timebecame the master of those that could be of any service to him, and asore enemy to those that could do him any mischief. 'Tis thus, thatthe first look he gave into himself produced the first emotion ofpride in him; 'tis thus that, at a time he scarce knew how todistinguish between the different ranks of existence, by attributingto his species the first rank among animals in general, he preparedhimself at a distance to pretend to it as an individual among those ofhis own species in particular.Though other men were not to him what they are to us, and he hadscarce more intercourse with them than with other animals, they werenot overlooked in his observations. The conformities, which in timehe might discover between them, and between himself and his female,made him judge of those he did not perceive; and seeing that they allbehaved as himself would have done in similar circumstances, heconcluded that their manner of thinking and willing was quiteconformable to his own; and this important truth, when once engraveddeeply on his mind, made him follow, by a presentiment as sure as anylogic, and withal much quicker, the best rules of conduct, which forthe sake of his own safety and advantage it was proper he shouldobserve towards them.Instructed by experience that the love of happiness is the soleprinciple of all human actions, he found himself in a condition todistinguish the few cases, in which common interest might authorizehim to build upon the assistance of his fellows, and those stillfewer, in which a competition of interests might justly render itsuspected. In the first case he united with them in the same flock, orat most by some kind of free association which obliged none of itsmembers, and lasted no longer than the transitory necessity that hadgiven birth to it. In the second case every one aimed at his ownprivate advantage, either by open force if he found himself strongenough, or by cunning and address if he thought himself too weak touse violence.Such was the manner in which men might have insensibly acquired somegross idea of their mutual engagements and the advantage of fulfillingthem, but this only as far as their present and sensible interestrequired; for as to foresight they were utter strangers to it, and farfrom troubling their heads about a distant futurity, they scarcethought of the day following. Was a deer to be taken? Every one sawthat to succeed he must faithfully stand to his post; but suppose ahare to have slipped by within reach of any one of them, it is not tobe doubted but he pursued it without scruple, and when he had seizedhis prey never reproached himself with having made his companions misstheirs.We may easily conceive that such an intercourse scarce required a morerefined language than that of crows and monkeys, which flock togetheralmost in the same manner. Inarticulate exclamations, a great manygestures, and some imitative sounds, must have been for a long timethe universal language of mankind, and by joining to these in everycountry some articulate and conventional sounds, of which, as I havealready hinted, it is not very easy to explain the institution, therearose particular languages, but rude, imperfect, and such nearly asare to be found at this day among several savage nations. My penstraightened by the rapidity of time, the abundance of things I haveto say, and the almost insensible progress of the first improvements,flies like an arrow over numberless ages, for the slower thesuccession of events, the quicker I may allow myself to be in relatingthem.At length, these first improvements enabled man to improve at agreater rate. Industry grew perfect in proportion as the mind becamemore enlightened. Men soon ceasing to fall asleep under the firsttree, or take shelter in the first cavern, lit upon some hard andsharp kinds of stone resembling spades or hatchets, and employed themto dig the ground, cut down trees, and with the branches build huts,which they afterwards bethought themselves of plastering over withclay or dirt. This was the epoch of a first revolution, which producedthe establishment and distinction of families, and which introduced aspecies of property, and along with it perhaps a thousand quarrels andbattles. As the strongest however were probably the first to makethemselves cabins, which they knew they were able to defend, we mayconclude that the weak found it much shorter and safer to imitate thanto attempt to dislodge them: and as to those, who were alreadyprovided with cabins, no one could have any great temptation to seizeupon that of his neighbour, not so much because it did not belong tohim, as because it could be of no service to him; and as besides tomake himself master of it, he must expose himself to a very sharpconflict with the present occupiers.The first developments of the heart were the effects of a newsituation, which united husbands and wives, parents and children,under one roof; the habit of living together gave birth to thesweetest sentiments the human species is acquainted with, conjugal andpaternal love. Every family became a little society, so much the morefirmly united, as a mutual attachment and liberty were the only bondsof it; and it was now that the sexes, whose way of life had beenhitherto the same, began to adopt different manners and customs. Thewomen became more sedentary, and accustomed themselves to stay at homeand look after the children, while the men rambled abroad in quest ofsubsistence for the whole family. The two sexes likewise by living alittle more at their ease began to lose somewhat of their usualferocity and sturdiness; but if on the one hand individuals becameless able to engage separately with wild beasts, they on the otherwere more easily got together to make a common resistance againstthem.In this new state of things, the simplicity and solitariness of man'slife, the limitedness of his wants, and the instruments which he hadinvented to satisfy them, leaving him a great deal of leisure, heemployed it to supply himself with several conveniences unknown to hisancestors; and this was the first yoke he inadvertently imposed uponhimself, and the first source of mischief which he prepared for hischildren; for besides continuing in this manner to soften both bodyand mind, these conveniences having through use lost almost all theiraptness to please, and even degenerated into real wants, the privationof them became far more intolerable than the possession of them hadbeen agreeable; to lose them was a misfortune, to possess them nohappiness.Here we may a little better discover how the use of speech insensiblycommences or improves in the bosom of every family, and may likewisefrom conjectures concerning the manner in which divers particularcauses might have propagated language, and accelerated its progress byrendering it every day more and more necessary. Great inundations orearthquakes surrounded inhabited districts with water or precipices,portions of the continent were by revolutions of the globe torn offand split into islands. It is obvious that among men thus collected,and forced to live together, a common idiom must have started up muchsooner, than among those who freely wandered through the forests ofthe main land. Thus it is very possible that the inhabitants of theislands formed in this manner, after their first essays in navigation,brought among us the use of speech; and it is very probable at leastthat society and languages commenced in islands and even acquiredperfection there, before the inhabitants of the continent knewanything of either.Everything now begins to wear a new aspect. Those who heretoforewandered through the woods, by taking to a more settled way of life,gradually flock together, coalesce into several separate bodies, andat length form in every country distinct nations, united in characterand manners, not by any laws or regulations, but by an uniform mannerof life, a sameness of provisions, and the common influence of theclimate. A permanent neighborhood must at last infallibly create someconnection between different families. The transitory commercerequired by nature soon produced, among the youth of both sexes livingin contiguous cabins, another kind of commerce, which besides beingequally agreeable is rendered more durable by mutual intercourse. Menbegin to consider different objects, and to make comparisons; theyinsensibly acquire ideas of merit and beauty, and these soon producesentiments of preference. By seeing each other often they contract ahabit, which makes it painful not to see each other always. Tender andagreeable sentiments steal into the soul, and are by the smallestopposition wound up into the most impetuous fury: Jealousy kindleswith love; discord triumphs; and the gentlest of passions requiressacrifices of human blood to appease it.In proportion as ideas and sentiments succeed each other, and the headand the heart exercise themselves, men continue to shake off theiroriginal wildness, and their connections become more intimate andextensive. They now begin to assemble round a great tree: singing anddancing, the genuine offspring of love and leisure, become theamusement or rather the occupation of the men and women, free fromcare, thus gathered together. Every one begins to survey the rest, andwishes to be surveyed himself; and public esteem acquires a value. Hewho sings or dances best; the handsomest, the strongest, the mostdexterous, the most eloquent, comes to be the most respected: this wasthe first step towards inequality, and at the same time towards vice.From these first preferences there proceeded on one side vanity andcontempt, on the other envy and shame; and the fermentation raised bythese new leavens at length produced combinations fatal to happinessand innocence.Men no sooner began to set a value upon each other, and know whatesteem was, than each laid claim to it, and it was no longer safe forany man to refuse it to another. Hence the first duties of civilityand politeness, even among savages; and hence every voluntary injurybecame an affront, as besides the mischief, which resulted from it asan injury, the party offended was sure to find in it a contempt forhis person more intolerable than the mischief itself. It was thus thatevery man, punishing the contempt expressed for him by others inproportion to the value he set upon himself, the effects of revengebecame terrible, and men learned to be sanguinary and cruel. Suchprecisely was the degree attained by most of the savage nations withwhom we are acquainted. And it is for want of sufficientlydistinguishing ideas, and observing at how great a distance thesepeople were from the first state of nature, that so many authors havehastily concluded that man is naturally cruel, and requires a regularsystem of police to be reclaimed; whereas nothing can be more gentlethan he in his primitive state, when placed by nature at an equaldistance from the stupidity of brutes, and the pernicious good senseof civilized man; and equally confined by instinct and reason to thecare of providing against the mischief which threatens him, he iswithheld by natural compassion from doing any injury to others, so farfrom being ever so little prone even to return that which he hasreceived. For according to the axiom of the wise Locke, Where there isno property, there can be no injury.But we must take notice, that the society now formed and the relationsnow established among men required in them qualities different fromthose, which they derived from their primitive constitution; that as asense of morality began to insinuate itself into human actions, andevery man, before the enacting of laws, was the only judge and avengerof the injuries he had received, that goodness of heart suitable tothe pure state of nature by no means suited infant society; that itwas necessary punishments should become severer in the same proportionthat the opportunities of offending became more frequent, and thedread of vengeance add strength to the too weak curb of the law. Thus,though men were become less patient, and natural compassion hadalready suffered some alteration, this period of the development ofthe human faculties, holding a just mean between the indolence of theprimitive state, and the petulant activity of self-love, must havebeen the happiest and most durable epoch. The more we reflect on thisstate, the more convinced we shall be, that it was the least subjectof any to revolutions, the best for man, and that nothing could havedrawn him out of it but some fatal accident, which, for the publicgood, should never have happened. The example of the savages, most ofwhom have been found in this condition, seems to confirm that mankindwas formed ever to remain in it, that this condition is the real youthof the world, and that all ulterior improvements have been so manysteps, in appearance towards the perfection of individuals, but infact towards the decrepitness of the species.As long as men remained satisfied with their rustic cabins; as long asthey confined themselves to the use of clothes made of the skins ofother animals, and the use of thorns and fish-bones, in putting theseskins together; as long as they continued to consider feathers andshells as sufficient ornaments, and to paint their bodies of differentcolours, to improve or ornament their bows and arrows, to form andscoop out with sharp-edged stones some little fishing boats, or clumsyinstruments of music; in a word, as long as they undertook such worksonly as a single person could finish, and stuck to such arts as didnot require the joint endeavours of several hands, they lived free,healthy, honest and happy, as much as their nature would admit, andcontinued to enjoy with each other all the pleasures of an independentintercourse; but from the moment one man began to stand in need ofanother's assistance; from the moment it appeared an advantage for oneman to possess the quantity of provisions requisite for two, allequality vanished; property started up; labour became necessary; andboundless forests became smiling fields, which it was found necessaryto water with human sweat, and in which slavery and misery were soonseen to sprout out and grow with the fruits of the earth.Metallurgy and agriculture were the two arts whose invention producedthis great revolution. With the poet, it is gold and silver, but withthe philosopher it is iron and corn, which have civilized men, andruined mankind. Accordingly both one and the other were unknown to thesavages of America, who for that very reason have always continuedsavages; nay other nations seem to have continued in a state ofbarbarism, as long as they continued to exercise one only of thesearts without the other; and perhaps one of the best reasons that canbe assigned, why Europe has been, if not earlier, at least moreconstantly and better civilized than the other quarters of the world,is that she both abounds most in iron and is best qualified toproduce corn.It is a very difficult matter to tell how men came to know anything ofiron, and the art of employing it: for we are not to suppose that theyshould of themselves think of digging it out of the mines, andpreparing it for fusion, before they knew what could be the result ofsuch a process. On the other hand, there is the less reason toattribute this discovery to any accidental fire, as mines are formednowhere but in dry and barren places, and such as are bare of treesand plants, so that it looks as if nature had taken pains to keep fromus so mischievous a secret. Nothing therefore remains but theextraordinary circumstance of some volcano, which, belching forthmetallic substances ready fused, might have given the spectators anotion of imitating that operation of nature; and after all we mustsuppose them endued with an extraordinary stock of courage andforesight to undertake so painful a work, and have, at so great adistance, an eye to the advantages they might derive from it;qualities scarcely suitable but to heads more exercised, than those ofsuch discoverers can be supposed to have been.As to agriculture, the principles of it were known a long time beforethe practice of it took place, and it is hardly possible that men,constantly employed in drawing their subsistence from trees andplants, should not have early hit on the means employed by nature forthe generation of vegetables; but in all probability it was very latebefore their industry took a turn that way, either because trees,which with their land and water game supplied them with sufficientfood, did not require their attention; or because they did not knowthe use of corn; or because they had no instruments to cultivate it;or because they were destitute of foresight in regard to futurenecessities; or in fine, because they wanted means to hinder othersfrom running away with the fruit of their labours. We may believe thaton their becoming more industrious they began their agriculture bycultivating with sharp stones and pointed sticks a few pulse or rootsabout their cabins; and that it was a long time before they knew themethod of preparing corn, and were provided with instruments necessaryto raise it in large quantities; not to mention the necessity thereis, in order to follow this occupation and sow lands, to consent tolose something at present to gain a great deal hereafter; a precautionvery foreign to the turn of man's mind in a savage state, in which, asI have already taken notice, he can hardly foresee his wants frommorning to night.For this reason the invention of other arts must have been necessaryto oblige mankind to apply to that of agriculture. As soon as menwere wanted to fuse and forge iron, others were wanted to maintainthem. The more hands were employed in manufactures, the fewer handswere left to provide subsistence for all, though the number of mouthsto be supplied with food continued the same; and as some requiredcommodities in exchange for their iron, the rest at last found out themethod of making iron subservient to the multiplication ofcommodities. Hence on the one hand husbandry and agriculture, and onthe other the art of working metals and of multiplying the uses ofthem.To the tilling of the earth the distribution of it necessarilysucceeded, and to property once acknowledged, the first rules ofjustice: for to secure every man his own, every man must havesomething. Moreover, as men began to extend their views to futurity,and all found themselves in possession of more or less goods capableof being lost, every one in particular had reason to fear, lestreprisals should be made on him for any injury he might do to others.This origin is so much the more natural, as it is impossible toconceive how property can flow from any other source but industry; forwhat can a man add but his labour to things which he has not made, inorder to acquire a property in them? 'Tis the labour of the handsalone, which giving the husbandman a title to the produce of the landhe has tilled gives him a title to the land itself, at least till hehas gathered in the fruits of it, and so on from year to year; andthis enjoyment forming a continued possession is easily transformedinto a property. The ancients, says Grotius, by giving to Ceres theepithet of Legislatrix, and to a festival celebrated in her honour thename of Thesmorphoria, insinuated that the distribution of landsproduced a new kind of right; that is, the right of property differentfrom that which results from the law of nature.Things thus circumstanced might have remained equal, if men's talentshad been equal, and if, for instance, the use of iron, and theconsumption of commodities had always held an exact proportion to eachother; but as this proportion had no support, it was soon broken. Theman that had most strength performed most labour; the most dexterousturned his labour to best account; the most ingenious found outmethods of lessening his labour; the husbandman required more iron, orthe smith more corn, and while both worked equally, one earned a greatdeal by his labour, while the other could scarce live by his. It isthus that natural inequality insensibly unfolds itself with thatarising from a variety of combinations, and that the difference amongmen, developed by the difference of their circumstances, becomes moresensible, more permanent in its effects, and begins to influence inthe same proportion the condition of private persons.Things once arrived at this period, it is an easy matter to imaginethe rest. I shall not stop to describe the successive inventions ofother arts, the progress of language, the trial and employments oftalents, the inequality of fortunes, the use or abuse of riches, norall the details which follow these, and which every one may easilysupply. I shall just give a glance at mankind placed in this new orderof things.Behold then all our faculties developed; our memory and imagination atwork, self-love interested; reason rendered active; and the mindalmost arrived at the utmost bounds of that perfection it is capableof. Behold all our natural qualities put in motion; the rank andcondition of every man established, not only as to the quantum ofproperty and the power of serving or hurting others, but likewise asto genius, beauty, strength or address, merit or talents; and as thesewere the only qualities which could command respect, it was foundnecessary to have or at least to affect them. It was requisite for mento be thought what they really were not. To be and to appear becametwo very different things, and from this distinction sprang pomp andknavery, and all the vices which form their train. On the other hand,man, heretofore free and independent, was now in consequence of amultitude of new wants brought under subjection, as it were, to allnature, and especially to his fellows, whose slave in some sense hebecame even by becoming their master; if rich, he stood in need oftheir services, if poor, of their assistance; even mediocrity itselfcould not enable him to do without them. He must therefore have beencontinually at work to interest them in his happiness, and make them,if not really, at least apparently find their advantage in labouringfor his: this rendered him sly and artful in his dealings with some,imperious and cruel in his dealings with others, and laid him underthe necessity of using ill all those whom he stood in need of, asoften as he could not awe them into a compliance with his will, anddid not find it his interest to purchase it at the expense of realservices. In fine, an insatiable ambition, the rage of raising theirrelative fortunes, not so much through real necessity, as to over-topothers, inspire all men with a wicked inclination to injure eachother, and with a secret jealousy so much the more dangerous, as tocarry its point with the greater security, it often puts on the faceof benevolence. In a word, sometimes nothing was to be seen but acontention of endeavours on the one hand, and an opposition ofinterests on the other, while a secret desire of thriving at theexpense of others constantly prevailed. Such were the first effects ofproperty, and the inseparable attendants of infant inequality.Riches, before the invention of signs to represent them, could scarceconsist in anything but lands and cattle, the only real goods whichmen can possess. But when estates increased so much in number and inextent as to take in whole countries and touch each other, it becameimpossible for one man to aggrandise himself but at the expense ofsome other; and the supernumerary inhabitants, who were too weak ortoo indolent to make such acquisitions in their turn, impoverishedwithout losing anything, because while everything about them changedthey alone remained the same, were obliged to receive or force theirsubsistence from the hands of the rich. And hence began to flow,according to the different characters of each, domination and slavery,or violence and rapine. The rich on their side scarce began to tastethe pleasure of commanding, when they preferred it to every other; andmaking use of their old slaves to acquire new ones, they no longerthought of anything but subduing and enslaving their neighbours; likethose ravenous wolves, who having once tasted human flesh, despiseevery other food, and devour nothing but men for the future.It is thus that the most powerful or the most wretched, respectivelyconsidering their power and wretchedness as a kind of title to thesubstance of others, even equivalent to that of property, the equalityonce broken was followed by the most shocking disorders. It is thusthat the usurpations of the rich, the pillagings of the poor, and theunbridled passions of all, by stifling the cries of naturalcompassion, and the as yet feeble voice of justice, rendered manavaricious, wicked and ambitious. There arose between the title of thestrongest, and that of the first occupier a perpetual conflict, whichalways ended in battery and bloodshed. Infant society became a sceneof the most horrible warfare: Mankind thus debased and harassed, andno longer able to retreat, or renounce the unhappy acquisitions it hadmade; labouring, in short merely to its confusion by the abuse ofthose faculties, which in themselves do it so much honour, broughtitself to the very brink of ruin and destruction. Attonitus novitate mali, divesque miserque, Effugere optat opes; et quoe modo voverat, odit.But it is impossible that men should not sooner or later have madereflections on so wretched a situation, and upon the calamities withwhich they were overwhelmed. The rich in particular must have soonperceived how much they suffered by a perpetual war, of which theyalone supported all the expense, and in which, though all risked life,they alone risked any substance. Besides, whatever colour they mightpretend to give their usurpations, they sufficiently saw that theseusurpations were in the main founded upon false and precarious titles,and that what they had acquired by mere force, others could again bymere force wrest out of their hands, without leaving them the leastroom to complain of such a proceeding. Even those, who owed all theirriches to their own industry, could scarce ground their acquisitionsupon a better title. It availed them nothing to say, 'Twas I builtthis wall; I acquired this spot by my labour. Who traced it out foryou, another might object, and what right have you to expect paymentat our expense for doing that we did not oblige you to do? Don't youknow that numbers of your brethren perish, or suffer grievously forwant of what you possess more than suffices nature, and that youshould have had the express and unanimous consent of mankind toappropriate to yourself of their common, more than was requisite foryour private subsistence? Destitute of solid reasons to justify, andsufficient force to defend himself; crushing individuals with ease,but with equal ease crushed by numbers; one against all, and unable,on account of mutual jealousies, to unite with his equals againstbanditti united by the common hopes of pillage; the rich man, thuspressed by necessity, at last conceived the deepest project that everentered the human mind: this was to employ in his favour the veryforces that attacked him, to make allies of his enemies, to inspirethem with other maxims, and make them adopt other institutions asfavourable to his pretensions, as the law of nature was unfavourableto them.With this view, after laying before his neighbours all the horrors ofa situation, which armed them all one against another, which renderedtheir possessions as burdensome as their wants were intolerable, andin which no one could expect any safety either in poverty or riches,he easily invented specious arguments to bring them over to hispurpose. \"Let us unite,\" said he, \"to secure the weak fromoppression, restrain the ambitious, and secure to every man thepossession of what belongs to him: Let us form rules of justice andpeace, to which all may be obliged to conform, which shall not exceptpersons, but may in some sort make amends for the caprice of fortune,by submitting alike the powerful and the weak to the observance ofmutual duties. In a word, instead of turning our forces againstourselves, let us collect them into a sovereign power, which maygovern us by wise laws, may protect and defend all the members of theassociation, repel common enemies, and maintain a perpetual concordand harmony among us.\"Much fewer words of this kind were sufficient to draw in a parcel ofrustics, whom it was an easy matter to impose upon, who had besidestoo many quarrels among themselves to live without arbiters, and toomuch avarice and ambition to live long without masters. All offeredtheir necks to the yoke in hopes of securing their liberty; for thoughthey had sense enough to perceive the advantages of a politicalconstitution, they had not experience enough to see beforehand thedangers of it; those among them, who were best qualified to foreseeabuses, were precisely those who expected to benefit by them; even thesoberest judged it requisite to sacrifice one part of their liberty toensure the other, as a man, dangerously wounded in any of his limbs,readily parts with it to save the rest of his body.Such was, or must have been, had man been left to himself, the originof society and of the laws, which increased the fetters of the weak,and the strength of the rich; irretrievably destroyed natural liberty,fixed for ever the laws of property and inequality; changed an artfulusurpation into an irrevocable title; and for the benefit of a fewambitious individuals subjected the rest of mankind to perpetuallabour, servitude, and misery. We may easily conceive how theestablishment of a single society rendered that of all the restabsolutely necessary, and how, to make head against united forces, itbecame necessary for the rest of mankind to unite in their turn.Societies once formed in this manner, soon multiplied or spread tosuch a degree, as to cover the face of the earth; and not to leave acorner in the whole universe, where a man could throw off the yoke,and withdraw his head from under the often ill-conducted sword whichhe saw perpetually hanging over it. The civil law being thus becomethe common rule of citizens, the law of nature no longer obtained butamong the different societies, in which, under the name of the law ofnations, it was qualified by some tacit conventions to render commercepossible, and supply the place of natural compassion, which, losing bydegrees all that influence over societies which it originally had overindividuals, no longer exists but in some great souls, who considerthemselves as citizens of the world, and forcing the imaginarybarriers that separate people from people, after the example of theSovereign Being from whom we all derive our existence, make the wholehuman race the object of their benevolence.Political bodies, thus remaining in a state of nature amongthemselves, soon experienced the inconveniences which had obligedindividuals to quit it; and this state became much more fatal to thesegreat bodies, than it had been before to the individuals which nowcomposed them. Hence those national wars, those battles, thosemurders, those reprisals, which make nature shudder and shock reason;hence all those horrible prejudices, which make it a virtue and anhonour to shed human blood. The worthiest men learned to consider thecutting the throats of their fellows as a duty; at length men began tobutcher each other by thousands without knowing for what; and moremurders were committed in a single action, and more horrible disordersat the taking of a single town, than had been committed in the stateof nature during ages together upon the whole face of the earth. Suchare the first effects we may conceive to have arisen from the divisionof mankind into different societies. Let us return to theirinstitution.I know that several writers have assigned other origins of politicalsociety; as for instance, the conquests of the powerful, or the unionof the weak; and it is no matter which of these causes we adopt inregard to what I am going to establish; that, however, which I havejust laid down, seems to me the most natural, for the followingreasons: First, because, in the first case, the right of conquestbeing in fact no right at all, it could not serve as a foundation forany other right, the conqueror and the conquered ever remaining withrespect to each other in a state of war, unless the conquered,restored to the full possession of their liberty, should freely choosetheir conqueror for their chief. Till then, whatever capitulationsmight have been made between them, as these capitulations were foundedupon violence, and of course _de facto_ null and void, there could nothave existed in this hypothesis either a true society, or a politicalbody, or any other law but that of the strongest. Second, becausethese words strong and weak, are ambiguous in the second case; forduring the interval between the establishment of the right of propertyor prior occupation and that of political government, the meaning ofthese terms is better expressed by the words poor and rich, as beforethe establishment of laws men in reality had no other means ofreducing their equals, but by invading the property of these equals,or by parting with some of their own property to them. Third, becausethe poor having nothing but their liberty to lose, it would have beenthe height of madness in them to give up willingly the only blessingthey had left without obtaining some consideration for it: whereas therich being sensible, if I may say so, in every part of theirpossessions, it was much easier to do them mischief, and thereforemore incumbent upon them to guard against it; and because, in fine, itis but reasonable to suppose, that a thing has been invented by him towhom it could be of service rather than by him to whom it must provedetrimental.Government in its infancy had no regular and permanent form. For wantof a sufficient fund of philosophy and experience, men could see nofurther than the present inconveniences, and never thought ofproviding remedies for future ones, but in proportion as they arose.In spite of all the labours of the wisest legislators, the politicalstate still continued imperfect, because it was in a manner the workof chance; and, as the foundations of it were ill laid, time, thoughsufficient to discover its defects and suggest the remedies for them,could never mend its original vices. Men were continually repairing;whereas, to erect a good edifice, they should have begun as Lycurgusdid at Sparta, by clearing the area, and removing the old materials.Society at first consisted merely of some general conventions whichall the members bound themselves to observe, and for the performanceof which the whole body became security to every individual.Experience was necessary to show the great weakness of such aconstitution, and how easy it was for those, who infringed it, toescape the conviction or chastisement of faults, of which the publicalone was to be both the witness and the judge; the laws could notfail of being eluded a thousand ways; inconveniences and disorderscould not but multiply continually, till it was at last foundnecessary to think of committing to private persons the dangeroustrust of public authority, and to magistrates the care of enforcingobedience to the people: for to say that chiefs were elected beforeconfederacies were formed, and that the ministers of the laws existedbefore the laws themselves, is a supposition too ridiculous to deserveI should seriously refute it.It would be equally unreasonable to imagine that men at first threwthemselves into the arms of an absolute master, without any conditionsor consideration on his side; and that the first means contrived byjealous and unconquered men for their common safety was to run handover head into slavery. In fact, why did they give themselvessuperiors, if it was not to be defended by them against oppression,and protected in their lives, liberties, and properties, which are ina manner the constitutional elements of their being? Now in therelations between man and man, the worst that can happen to one manbeing to see himself at the discretion of another, would it not havebeen contrary to the dictates of good sense to begin by making over toa chief the only things for the preservation of which they stood inneed of his assistance? What equivalent could he have offered themfor so fine a privilege? And had he presumed to exact it on pretenseof defending them, would he not have immediately received the answerin the apologue? What worse treatment can we expect from an enemy? Itis therefore past dispute, and indeed a fundamental maxim of politicallaw, that people gave themselves chiefs to defend their liberty andnot be enslaved by them. If we have a prince, said Pliny to Trajan, itis in order that he may keep us from having a master.Political writers argue in regard to the love of liberty with the samephilosophy that philosophers do in regard to the state of nature; bythe things they see they judge of things very different which theyhave never seen, and they attribute to men a natural inclination toslavery, on account of the patience with which the slaves within theirnotice carry the yoke; not reflecting that it is with liberty as withinnocence and virtue, the value of which is not known but by those whopossess them, though the relish for them is lost with the thingsthemselves. I know the charms of your country, said Brasidas to asatrap who was comparing the life of the Spartans with that of thePersepolites; but you can not know the pleasures of mine.As an unbroken courser erects his mane, paws the ground, and rages atthe bare sight of the bit, while a trained horse patiently suffersboth whip and spur, just so the barbarian will never reach his neck tothe yoke which civilized man carries without murmuring but prefers themost stormy liberty to a calm subjection. It is not therefore by theservile disposition of enslaved nations that we must judge of thenatural dispositions of man for or against slavery, but by theprodigies done by every free people to secure themselves fromoppression. I know that the first are constantly crying up that peaceand tranquillity they enjoy in their irons, and that _miserrimamservitutem pacem appellant_: but when I see the others sacrificepleasures, peace, riches, power, and even life itself to thepreservation of that single jewel so much slighted by those who havelost it; when I see free-born animals through a natural abhorrence ofcaptivity dash their brains out against the bars of their prison; whenI see multitudes of naked savages despise European pleasures, andbrave hunger, fire and sword, and death itself to preserve theirindependency; I feel that it belongs not to slaves to argue concerningliberty.As to paternal authority, from which several have derived absolutegovernment and every other mode of society, it is sufficient, withouthaving recourse to Locke and Sidney, to observe that nothing in theworld differs more from the cruel spirit of despotism that thegentleness of that authority, which looks more to the advantage of himwho obeys than to the utility of him who commands; that by the law ofnature the father continues master of his child no longer than thechild stands in need of his assistance; that after that term theybecome equal, and that then the son, entirely independent of thefather, owes him no obedience, but only respect. Gratitude is indeeda duty which we are bound to pay, but which benefactors can not exact.Instead of saying that civil society is derived from paternalauthority, we should rather say that it is to the former that thelatter owes its principal force: No one individual was acknowledged asthe father of several other individuals, till they settled about him.The father's goods, which he can indeed dispose of as he pleases, arethe ties which hold his children to their dependence upon him, and hemay divide his substance among them in proportion as they shall havedeserved his attention by a continual deference to his commands. Nowthe subjects of a despotic chief, far from having any such favour toexpect from him, as both themselves and all they have are hisproperty, or at least are considered by him as such, are obliged toreceive as a favour what he relinquishes to them of their ownproperty. He does them justice when he strips them; he treats themwith mercy when he suffers them to live. By continuing in this mannerto compare facts with right, we should discover as little solidity astruth in the voluntary establishment of tyranny; and it would be ahard matter to prove the validity of a contract which was binding onlyon one side, in which one of the parties should stake everything andthe other nothing, and which could turn out to the prejudice of himalone who had bound himself.This odious system is even, at this day, far from being that of wiseand good monarchs, and especially of the kings of France, as may beseen by divers passages in their edicts, and particularly by that of acelebrated piece published in 1667 in the name and by the orders ofLouis XIV. \"Let it therefore not be said that the sovereign is notsubject to the laws of his realm, since, that he is, is a maxim of thelaw of nations which flattery has sometimes attacked, but which goodprinces have always defended as the tutelary divinity of their realms.How much more reasonable is it to say with the sage Plato, that theperfect happiness of a state consists in the subjects obeying theirprince, the prince obeying the laws, and the laws being equitable andalways directed to the good of the public?\" I shall not stop toconsider, if, liberty being the most noble faculty of man, it is notdegrading one's nature, reducing one's self to the level of brutes,who are the slaves of instinct, and even offending the author of one'sbeing, to renounce without reserve the most precious of his gifts, andsubmit to the commission of all the crimes he has forbid us, merely togratify a mad or a cruel master; and if this sublime artist ought tobe more irritated at seeing his work destroyed than at seeing itdishonoured. I shall only ask what right those, who were not afraidthus to degrade themselves, could have to subject their dependants tothe same ignominy, and renounce, in the name of their posterity,blessings for which it is not indebted to their liberality, andwithout which life itself must appear a burthen to all those who areworthy to live.Puffendorf says that, as we can transfer our property from one toanother by contracts and conventions, we may likewise divest ourselvesof our liberty in favour of other men. This, in my opinion, is a verypoor way of arguing; for, in the first place, the property I cede toanother becomes by such cession a thing quite foreign to me, and theabuse of which can no way affect me; but it concerns me greatly thatmy liberty is not abused, and I can not, without incurring the guiltof the crimes I may be forced to commit, expose myself to become theinstrument of any. Besides, the right of property being of mere humanconvention and institution, every man may dispose as he pleases ofwhat he possesses: But the case is otherwise with regard to theessential gifts of nature, such as life and liberty, which every manis permitted to enjoy, and of which it is doubtful at least whetherany man has a right to divest himself: By giving up the one, wedegrade our being; by giving up the other we annihilate it as much asit is our power to do so; and as no temporal enjoyments can indemnifyus for the loss of either, it would be at once offending both natureand reason to renounce them for any consideration. But though we couldtransfer our liberty as we do our substance, the difference would bevery great with regard to our children, who enjoy our substance but bya cession of our right; whereas liberty being a blessing, which as menthey hold from nature, their parents have no right to strip them ofit; so that as to establish slavery it was necessary to do violence tonature, so it was necessary to alter nature to perpetuate such aright; and the jurisconsults, who have gravely pronounced that thechild of a slave comes a slave into the world, have in other wordsdecided, that a man does not come a man into the world.It therefore appears to me incontestably true, that not onlygovernments did not begin by arbitrary power, which is but thecorruption and extreme term of government, and at length brings itback to the law of the strongest, against which governments were atfirst the remedy, but even that, allowing they had commenced in thismanner, such power being illegal in itself could never have served asa foundation to the rights of society, nor of course to the inequalityof institution.I shall not now enter upon the inquiries which still remain to be madeinto the nature of the fundamental pacts of every kind of government,but, following the common opinion, confine myself in this place to theestablishment of the political body as a real contract between themultitude and the chiefs elected by it. A contract by which bothparties oblige themselves to the observance of the laws that aretherein stipulated, and form the bands of their union. The multitudehaving, on occasion of the social relations between them, concenteredall their wills in one person, all the articles, in regard to whichthis will explains itself, become so many fundamental laws, whichoblige without exception all the members of the state, and one ofwhich laws regulates the choice and the power of the magistratesappointed to look to the execution of the rest. This power extends toeverything that can maintain the constitution, but extends to nothingthat can alter it. To this power are added honours, that may renderthe laws and the ministers of them respectable; and the persons of theministers are distinguished by certain prerogatives, which may makethem amends for the great fatigues inseparable from a goodadministration. The magistrate, on his side, obliges himself not touse the power with which he is intrusted but conformably to theintention of his constituents, to maintain every one of them in thepeaceable possession of his property, and upon all occasions preferthe good of the public to his own private interest.Before experience had demonstrated, or a thorough knowledge of thehuman heart had pointed out, the abuses inseparable from such aconstitution, it must have appeared so much the more perfect, as thoseappointed to look to its preservation were themselves most concernedtherein; for magistracy and its rights being built solely on thefundamental laws, as soon as these ceased to exist, the magistrateswould cease to be lawful, the people would no longer be bound to obeythem, and, as the essence of the state did not consist in themagistrates but in the laws, the members of it would immediatelybecome entitled to their primitive and natural liberty.A little reflection would afford us new arguments in confirmation ofthis truth, and the nature of the contract might alone convince usthat it can not be irrevocable: for if there was no superior powercapable of guaranteeing the fidelity of the contracting parties and ofobliging them to fulfil their mutual engagements, they would remainsole judges in their own cause, and each of them would always have aright to renounce the contract, as soon as he discovered that theother had broke the conditions of it, or that these conditions ceasedto suit his private convenience. Upon this principle, the right ofabdication may probably be founded. Now, to consider as we do nothingbut what is human in this institution, if the magistrate, who has allthe power in his own hands, and who appropriates to himself all theadvantages of the contract, has notwithstanding a right to divesthimself of his authority; how much a better right must the people, whopay for all the faults of its chief, have to renounce their dependenceupon him. But the shocking dissensions and disorders without number,which would be the necessary consequence of so dangerous a privilege,show more than anything else how much human governments stood in needof a more solid basis than that of mere reason, and how necessary itwas for the public tranquillity, that the will of the Almighty shouldinterpose to give to sovereign authority, a sacred and inviolablecharacter, which should deprive subjects of the mischievous right todispose of it to whom they pleased. If mankind had received no otheradvantages from religion, this alone would be sufficient to make themadopt and cherish it, since it is the means of saving more blood thanfanaticism has been the cause of spilling. But to resume the thread ofour hypothesis.The various forms of government owe their origin to the variousdegrees of inequality between the members, at the time they firstcoalesced into a political body. Where a man happened to be eminentfor power, for virtue, for riches, or for credit, he became solemagistrate, and the state assumed a monarchical form; if many ofpretty equal eminence out-topped all the rest, they were jointlyelected, and this election produced an aristocracy; those, betweenwhose fortune or talents there happened to be no such disproportion,and who had deviated less from the state of nature, retained in commonthe supreme administration, and formed a democracy. Time demonstratedwhich of these forms suited mankind best. Some remained altogethersubject to the laws; others soon bowed their necks to masters. Theformer laboured to preserve their liberty; the latter thought ofnothing but invading that of their neighbours, jealous at seeingothers enjoy a blessing which themselves had lost. In a word, richesand conquest fell to the share of the one, and virtue and happiness tothat of the other.In these various modes of government the offices at first were allelective; and when riches did not preponderate, the preference wasgiven to merit, which gives a natural ascendant, and to age, which isthe parent of deliberateness in council, and experience in execution.The ancients among the Hebrews, the Geronts of Sparta, the Senate ofRome, nay, the very etymology of our word seigneur, show how much grayhairs were formerly respected. The oftener the choice fell upon oldmen, the oftener it became necessary to repeat it, and the more thetrouble of such repetitions became sensible; electioneering tookplace; factions arose; the parties contracted ill blood; civil warsblazed forth; the lives of the citizens were sacrificed to thepretended happiness of the state; and things at last came to such apass, as to be ready to relapse into their primitive confusion. Theambition of the principal men induced them to take advantage of thesecircumstances to perpetuate the hitherto temporary charges in theirfamilies; the people already inured to dependence, accustomed to easeand the conveniences of life, and too much enervated to break theirfetters, consented to the increase of their slavery for the sake ofsecuring their tranquillity; and it is thus that chiefs, becomehereditary, contracted the habit of considering magistracies as afamily estate, and themselves as proprietors of those communities, ofwhich at first they were but mere officers; to call theirfellow-citizens their slaves; to look upon them, like so many cows orsheep, as a part of their substance; and to style themselves the peersof Gods, and Kings of Kings.By pursuing the progress of inequality in these different revolutions,we shall discover that the establishment of laws and of the right ofproperty was the first term of it; the institution of magistrates thesecond; and the third and last the changing of legal into arbitrarypower; so that the different states of rich and poor were authorizedby the first epoch; those of powerful and weak by the second; and bythe third those of master and slave, which formed the last degree ofinequality, and the term in which all the rest at last end, till newrevolutions entirely dissolve the government, or bring it back nearerto its legal constitution.To conceive the necessity of this progress, we are not so much toconsider the motives for the establishment of political bodies, as theforms these bodies assume in their administration; and theinconveniences with which they are essentially attended; for thosevices, which render social institutions necessary, are the same whichrender the abuse of such institutions unavoidable; and as (Spartaalone excepted, whose laws chiefly regarded the education of children,and where Lycurgus established such manners and customs, as in a greatmeasure made laws needless,) the laws, in general less strong than thepassions, restrain men without changing them; it would be no hardmatter to prove that every government, which carefully guardingagainst all alteration and corruption should scrupulously comply withthe ends of its institution, was unnecessarily instituted; and that acountry, where no one either eluded the laws, or made an ill use ofmagistracy, required neither laws nor magistrates.Political distinctions are necessarily attended with civildistinctions. The inequality between the people and the chiefsincrease so fast as to be soon felt by the private members, andappears among them in a thousand shapes according to their passions,their talents, and the circumstances of affairs. The magistrate cannot usurp any illegal power without making himself creatures, withwhom he must divide it. Besides, the citizens of a free state sufferthemselves to be oppressed merely in proportion as, hurried on by ablind ambition, and looking rather below than above them, they come tolove authority more than independence. When they submit to fetters,'tis only to be the better able to fetter others in their turn. It isno easy matter to make him obey, who does not wish to command; and themost refined policy would find it impossible to subdue those men, whoonly desire to be independent; but inequality easily gains groundamong base and ambitious souls, ever ready to run the risks offortune, and almost indifferent whether they command or obey, as sheproves either favourable or adverse to them. Thus then there must havebeen a time, when the eyes of the people were bewitched to such adegree, that their rulers needed only to have said to the most pitifulwretch, \"Be great you and all your posterity,\" to make him immediatelyappear great in the eyes of every one as well as in his own; and hisdescendants took still more upon them, in proportion to their removesfrom him: the more distant and uncertain the cause, the greater theeffect; the longer line of drones a family produced, the moreillustrious it was reckoned.Were this a proper place to enter into details, I could easily explainin what manner inequalities in point of credit and authority becomeunavoidable among private persons the moment that, united into onebody, they are obliged to compare themselves one with another, and tonote the differences which they find in the continual use every manmust make of his neighbour. These differences are of several kinds;but riches, nobility or rank, power and personal merit, being ingeneral the principal distinctions, by which men in society measureeach other, I could prove that the harmony or conflict between thesedifferent forces is the surest indication of the good or bad originalconstitution of any state: I could make it appear that, as among thesefour kinds of inequality, personal qualities are the source of all therest, riches is that in which they ultimately terminate, because,being the most immediately useful to the prosperity of individuals,and the most easy to communicate, they are made use of to purchaseevery other distinction. By this observation we are enabled to judgewith tolerable exactness, how much any people has deviated from itsprimitive institution, and what steps it has still to make to theextreme term of corruption. I could show how much this universaldesire of reputation, of honours, of preference, with which we are alldevoured, exercises and compares our talents and our forces: how muchit excites and multiplies our passions; and, by creating an universalcompetition, rivalship, or rather enmity among men, how manydisappointments, successes, and catastrophes of every kind it dailycauses among the innumerable pretenders whom it engages in the samecareer. I could show that it is to this itch of being spoken of, tothis fury of distinguishing ourselves which seldom or never gives us amoment's respite, that we owe both the best and the worst things amongus, our virtues and our vices, our sciences and our errors, ourconquerors and our philosophers; that is to say, a great many badthings to a very few good ones. I could prove, in short, that if webehold a handful of rich and powerful men seated on the pinnacle offortune and greatness, while the crowd grovel in obscurity and want,it is merely because the first prize what they enjoy but in the samedegree that others want it, and that, without changing theircondition, they would cease to be happy the minute the people ceasedto be miserable.But these details would alone furnish sufficient matter for a moreconsiderable work, in which might be weighed the advantages anddisadvantages of every species of government, relatively to the rightsof man in a state of nature, and might likewise be unveiled all thedifferent faces under which inequality has appeared to this day, andmay hereafter appear to the end of time, according to the nature ofthese several governments, and the revolutions time must unavoidablyoccasion in them. We should then see the multitude oppressed bydomestic tyrants in consequence of those very precautions taken bythem to guard against foreign masters. We should see oppressionincrease continually without its being ever possible for the oppressedto know where it would stop, nor what lawful means they had left tocheck its progress. We should see the rights of citizens, and theliberties of nations extinguished by slow degrees, and the groans, andprotestations and appeals of the weak treated as seditious murmurings.We should see policy confine to a mercenary portion of the people thehonour of defending the common cause. We should see imposts madenecessary by such measures, the disheartened husbandman desert hisfield even in time of peace, and quit the plough to take up the sword.We should see fatal and whimsical rules laid down concerning the pointof honour. We should see the champions of their country sooner orlater become her enemies, and perpetually holding their poniards tothe breasts of their fellow citizens. Nay, the time would come whenthey might be heard to say to the oppressor of their country: Pectore si fratris gladium juguloque parentis Condere me jubeas, gravidoeque in viscera partu Conjugis, in vita peragam tamen omnia dextra.From the vast inequality of conditions and fortunes, from the greatvariety of passions and of talents, of useless arts, of perniciousarts, of frivolous sciences, would issue clouds of prejudices equallycontrary to reason, to happiness, to virtue. We should see the chiefsfoment everything that tends to weaken men formed into societies bydividing them; everything that, while it gives society an air ofapparent harmony, sows in it the seeds of real division; everythingthat can inspire the different orders with mutual distrust and hatredby an opposition of their rights and interest, and of coursestrengthen that power which contains them all.'Tis from the bosom of this disorder and these revolutions, thatdespotism gradually rearing up her hideous crest, and devouring inevery part of the state all that still remained sound and untainted,would at last issue to trample upon the laws and the people, andestablish herself upon the ruins of the republic. The timesimmediately preceding this last alteration would be times of calamityand trouble: but at last everything would be swallowed up by themonster; and the people would no longer have chiefs or laws, but onlytyrants. At this fatal period all regard to virtue and manners wouldlikewise disappear; for despotism, _cui ex honesto nulla est spes_,tolerates no other master, wherever it reigns; the moment it speaks,probity and duty lose all their influence, and the blindest obedienceis the only virtue the miserable slaves have left them to practise.This is the last term of inequality, the extreme point which closesthe circle and meets that from which we set out. 'Tis here that allprivate men return to their primitive equality, because they are nolonger of any account; and that, the subjects having no longer any lawbut that of their master, nor the master any other law but hispassions, all notions of good and principles of justice againdisappear. 'Tis here that everything returns to the sole law of thestrongest, and of course to a new state of nature different from thatwith which we began, in as much as the first was the state of naturein its purity, and the last the consequence of excessive corruption.There is, in other respects, so little difference between these twostates, and the contract of government is so much dissolved bydespotism, that the despot is no longer master than he continues thestrongest, and that, as soon as his slaves can expel him, they may doit without his having the least right to complain of their using himill. The insurrection, which ends in the death or despotism of asultan, is as juridical an act as any by which the day before hedisposed of the lives and fortunes of his subjects. Force alone upheldhim, force alone overturns him. Thus all things take place and succeedin their natural order; and whatever may be the upshot of these hastyand frequent revolutions, no one man has reason to complain ofanother's injustice, but only of his own indiscretion or bad fortune.By thus discovering and following the lost and forgotten tracks, bywhich man from the natural must have arrived at the civil state; byrestoring, with the intermediate positions which I have been justindicating, those which want of leisure obliges me to suppress, orwhich my imagination has not suggested, every attentive reader mustunavoidably be struck at the immense space which separates these twostates. 'Tis in this slow succession of things he may meet with thesolution of an infinite number of problems in morality and politics,which philosophers are puzzled to solve. He will perceive that, themankind of one age not being the mankind of another, the reason whyDiogenes could not find a man was, that he sought among hiscotemporaries the man of an earlier period: Cato, he will then see,fell with Rome and with liberty, because he did not suit the age inwhich he lived; and the greatest of men served only to astonish thatworld, which would have cheerfully obeyed him, had he come into itfive hundred years earlier. In a word, he will find himself in acondition to understand how the soul and the passions of men byinsensible alterations change as it were their nature; how it comes topass, that at the long run our wants and our pleasures change objects;that, original man vanishing by degrees, society no longer offers toour inspection but an assemblage of artificial men and factitiouspassions, which are the work of all these new relations, and have nofoundation in nature. Reflection teaches us nothing on that head, butwhat experience perfectly confirms. Savage man and civilised mandiffer so much at bottom in point of inclinations and passions, thatwhat constitutes the supreme happiness of the one would reduce theother to despair. The first sighs for nothing but repose and liberty;he desires only to live, and to be exempt from labour; nay, theataraxy of the most confirmed Stoic falls short of his consummateindifference for every other object. On the contrary, the citizenalways in motion, is perpetually sweating and toiling, and racking hisbrains to find out occupations still more laborious: He continues adrudge to his last minute; nay, he courts death to be able to live, orrenounces life to acquire immortality. He cringes to men in power whomhe hates, and to rich men whom he despises; he sticks at nothing tohave the honour of serving them; he is not ashamed to value himself onhis own weakness and the protection they afford him; and proud of hischains, he speaks with disdain of those who have not the honour ofbeing the partner of his bondage. What a spectacle must the painfuland envied labours of an European minister of state form in the eyesof a Caribbean! How many cruel deaths would not this indolent savageprefer to such a horrid life, which very often is not even sweetenedby the pleasure of doing good? But to see the drift of so many cares,his mind should first have affixed some meaning to these words powerand reputation; he should be apprised that there are men who consideras something the looks of the rest of mankind, who know how to behappy and satisfied with themselves on the testimony of others soonerthan upon their own. In fact, the real source of all thosedifferences, is that the savage lives within himself, whereas thecitizen, constantly beside himself, knows only how to live in theopinion of others; insomuch that it is, if I may say so, merely fromtheir judgment that he derives the consciousness of his own existence.It is foreign to my subject to show how this disposition engenders somuch indifference for good and evil, notwithstanding so many and suchfine discourses of morality; how everything, being reduced toappearances, becomes mere art and mummery; honour, friendship, virtue,and often vice itself, which we at last learn the secret to boast of;how, in short, ever inquiring of others what we are, and never daringto question ourselves on so delicate a point, in the midst of so muchphilosophy, humanity, and politeness, and so many sublime maxims, wehave nothing to show for ourselves but a deceitful and frivolousexterior, honour without virtue, reason without wisdom, and pleasurewithout happiness. It is sufficient that I have proved that this isnot the original condition of man, and that it is merely the spirit ofsociety, and the inequality which society engenders, that thus changeand transform all our natural inclinations.I have endeavoured to exhibit the origin and progress of inequality,the institution and abuse of political societies, as far as thesethings are capable of being deduced from the nature of man by the merelight of reason, and independently of those sacred maxims which giveto the sovereign authority the sanction of divine right. It followsfrom this picture, that as there is scarce any inequality among men ina state of nature, all that which we now behold owes its force and itsgrowth to the development of our faculties and the improvement of ourunderstanding, and at last becomes permanent and lawful by theestablishment of property and of laws. It likewise follows that moralinequality, authorised by any right that is merely positive, clasheswith natural right, as often as it does not combine in the sameproportion with physical inequality: a distinction which sufficientlydetermines, what we are able to think in that respect of that kind ofinequality which obtains in all civilised nations, since it isevidently against the law of nature that infancy should command oldage, folly conduct wisdom, and a handful of men should be ready tochoke with superfluities, while the famished multitude want thecommonest necessaries of life.[Transcriber's Note: Some words which appear to be potential typos areprinted as such in the original book: These possible words includecotemporaries and oftens. The paragraph starting with the words \"Thisodius system is even\" contains unmatched quotes, which have beenreproduced as they appeared in the orginal.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date. If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year. http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06 (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way. The year of a release date is no longer partof the directory path. The path is based on the etext number (which isidentical to the filename). The path to the file is made up of singledigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename. Forexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at: http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234or filename 24689 would be found at: http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689An alternative method of locating eBooks: http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL Copyright of Discourse upon the Origin & the Foundation of the Inequality Among Mankind is the property of J.
