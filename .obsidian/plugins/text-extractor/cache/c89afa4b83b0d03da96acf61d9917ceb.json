Environmental, social, and logisticalissues are motivating Americans to abandon automobility in favor of more efficient, clean, and sociallyresponsible public transportation. (Enright. p665).As this trend continues, it is incumbent upon the city of Portland Maine's government, businessleaders, and community members to continue to build and maintain systems and schedules of publictransportation that do the most good for the most people, while simultaneously and specifically avoidingharm to underserved and high need constituent consumers.This article aims to propose and defend the creation of a free and equitable public transport systemfor Portland, to serve the values and interests of the majority of Portland's populationEarly Transportation Network in Portland, MaineIn 1909, when Portland urban border extended from the Peninsula to Ocean Avenue, the cityboasted a transportation system that ran hourly to destinations as far afield as South Windham, OldOrchard Beach, and Lewiston.Interestingly, the trolly system of this era was established and maintained by the Grand TrunkRailroad, a British North American [Canadain] company, and as with most transportation systems of thetime, was intended to foster commerce in the North Eastern region of North America.It is startling to observe how sparse the population was in some of the areas serviced circa 1909. Inthis \"Birds Eye View\" we see that the lines extending out of the urban region of Portland are populatedby only a few homes. This illustrates the contemporary social justice agendas of that era. In 1909,farming and agriculture in Maine were predominantly, family operated and lower income families tendedto live and work in the urban center.All transport infrastructures condense social and political ideals. Mass urban transit in otherwords is always pursued for distinct purposes, and for the benefit of some urban dwellers and tothe detriment of others. (Enright. p666)Fig 1.Reflecting on the story being told by this transportation illustration (Fig 1.), it is clear that the\"exemplary public good,\" (Enright. p667) that these systems served aligned with connecting agriculturalproducts and tourist destinations to consumers and tourists, and not, specifically, towards promotingsocial equity and justice.21st Century Portland TransportAn economic appealAs we enter this post-auto-mobility era, it is crucial that we consider what impact our lower andmiddle-income population has had and will have on the economic, tourism, and cultural successes ofPortland. Without a thriving working class, businesses of Portland may face a labor shortage, andincreasing salaries, as lower and middle income families struggle to access employment within areasonable commute from their homes.Further, it is important to consider the value that artists, musicians, street vendors, and othercreatives bring to our city's success. As those populations find it increasingly difficult to find affordablehousing within walking distance of the centers of commerce, we must endeavor to prioritize their accessand sense of belonging to this community, lest they seek to find that belonging in more deservingcommunities.A social justice appealMass transit systems are imbricated in fundamental questions about who belongs in the city,who is allowed to participate fully in urban activities, who decides how space will be planned andproduced, and who gains from urban transformation (Enright p666)[Transit-led urbanism] also has the potential to entrench existing hierarchies and to createnew forms of urban marginality, inequality, and exclusion. Transit can be a vector of progressivechange, or it can threaten bodily integrity, drive uneven development, segregate populations,‘splinter’ urban space (Graham and Marvin 2001), reduce democratic influence, contribute toenvironmental injustice, and replicate and generate oppressive social relations. (Enright. p666)Fig 2.Fig 2. shows Portland's transportation map, overlayed with the Red (\"Hazardous\") and Yellow(\"Definitely Declining\") zones from the 1935 City of Portland \"Redline Map.\" It is remarkable to see how,in all cases except where access to \"Best\" and \"Still Desirable\" zones demand, the Red zones andYellow zones seem to be circumvented completely.With affordable housing on the peninsula all but out of reach for low and middle income families andindividuals, access to employment, services, entertainment, and in fact, belonging are, by intention oroversight, denied to these populations.Further, this overlay, while useful in describing the service area does not address the scheduling orcardinality of travel for these lines. For example, a Casco Bay High School student, living onWashington Ave can take a quick 20 minute ride to school on the 9B in the morning, but must take a 45minute ride on the 9A on the way home, if they are not able to walk for 15 minutes. For a student with adisability, this is an enormous burden. Note on the overlay transportation map, how the 9A/B lines servelargely \"Definitely Declining,\" communities.For a community to champion values such as desegregation, equality, inclusion, bodily autonomy,and justice, it must ensure that the fundamental access for a people to the services and affordances ofthat community are equally available to all. A fair, free, and just public transportation system providingaccess to and from all parts of the community is within reach, and absolutely necessary if Portland is toembody these values.Whether one wishes to optimize the Transport Good for social benefit (e.g. ideal personaccessibility) (Martins. p6), or seeks to optimize for economic benefit, some outcomes will remainconstant. This paper limits its focus to those areas of overlapping benefit.If Portland wishes to maintain its reputation as a small relaxed seaside city, we must ensure that theworking people of the city continue to have relaxed, well supported lives, so that ease will be naturallyapparent when they interface with the visiting population.Portland is currently an unfriendly city to the automobile commuter. With an overabundance of 2hour (or less) parking in the downtown area, there are precious few available day-long parking spots forretail workers. With 1 bedroom rents in the downtown area largely out of reach for retail income earners,this presents a significant obstacle for business owners in the area. How can employees working for lowhourly rates even afford to get to work?This paucity of available, day-long parking, combined with the aforementioned socioeconomicbenefit begs the question whether public transportation belongs in its on distributive sphere of socialjustice. That is to say, should transportation be refactored as a public service like parks, wastemanagement and sanitation, street cleaning, education, and environmental protection.In his paper\"Justice in transport as justice in accessibility:\" Martens explains how goods (such astransport) \"with distinct social meanings\" should be distributed \"solely on the basis of criteria that arerelevant for those goods.\" (p15) According to Walzer,To summarize, Martens via Walzer is suggesting that allowing free market economics to govern themanagement of a social good like transportation, is inherently unjust and will ultimately lead todiminishing the benefits that that good is meant to provide for society.Freedom of choice and potential mobility are strongly intertwined—with a high level ofpotential mobility implying a high level of choice in terms of employment opportunities, health careservices, leisure facilities, and so forth.\"a distributive sphere should guarantee that the distribution of the particular good isautonomous from the way in which other goods are distributed. According to Walzer, injusticeoccurs if spheres are not autonomous. In that case, the distribution of one good or one set ofgoods can become dominant and determine the distributions in all, or many, spheres ofdistribution. Typically, according to Walzer, money and power are the goods to claim dominance,and much of the policy debates, like those in the fields of basic education or health services, areabout limiting their domination. (Martins. p3)A free public transport system in Portland could engender the social, economic and evenenvironmental outcomes that serve the myriad values of Portland residents, visitors and businessowners hold. By removing capitalist drivers, city administrators would be empowered to focus ondelivery of service to lower and middle income regions, improve the infrastructure—perhapsreintroducing an electric trolly system, powered by local solar fields—and refactor scheduling andordinality of routes, so that students, retail/service workers, and tourists, have swift, reliable, and lowemission service to their destinations of choice.Goods to which a particular society ascribes a distinct social meaning, in contrast, are to betaken out of the sphere of free exchange. Typical examples in modern Western societies arehealth and education. These and comparable goods, Walzer argues, ‘deserve’ their owndistributive sphere.
