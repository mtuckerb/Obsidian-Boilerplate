Please pay close attention to these instructions. Requirement #1: One Initial Posting - (350 words minimum) Suggestions for Initial Postings: • Contribute well-explained ideas/insights, with careful reference to assigned resources (including the additional reading/listening assignments from outside the textbook) • Be sure to write your thoughts in your own words • Pose pertinent questions that expand our thinking • Refer us to relevant additional resources such as websites, articles, authors, ideas, etc., to further understand the issues involved • Write clearly and support your perspectives with concepts from the course materials Requirement #2: Two responses to other students’ postings (at least 250 words each) (Need clarification before responding to someone? Just ask the other student before offering your full response!) Suggestions for Responses: • Make connections among various points made by others, leading to new understandings • Point out critical issues neglected in initial posting and suggest redirection of thought • Fully respond to a question & take the discussion forward another step • Some characteristics I consider to be part of excellent discussion contributions are outlined below. I will consider these characteristics when assessing the quality and level of student participation. • Submit initial post(s) early and subsequent responses to the posts of other learners at timely intervals throughout the duration of the discussion. The goal is to have a dynamic discussion around the topic that lasts throughout assignment period. • Posts and responses should be substantive, thorough, and thoughtful. Just posting an \"I agree\" or \"Good ideas\" will not be considered adequate. Support statements with examples from the class materials, other references, and experiences. Keep in mind that fellow learners will be reading and responding to you too. • If you quote the text or another resource, you must cite this quote according to APA style: (Pastorino & Soyle-Portillo, 2019). • Response posts should be within a range of 250-500 words. If a response post does not meet the minimum word count of 250, it may not count toward your grade. • Make certain that all posts and responses address the question, problem, or situation as presented for discussion. This does not mean you should not extend the topic, but do not stray from the topic. • Discussions occur when there is dialogue; therefore, you need to build upon the posts and responses of other learners to create discussion threads. Make sure to revisit the discussion forum and respond (if necessary) to what other learners have posted to your initial responses. • When relevant, add to the discussion by including prior knowledge, work experiences, references, websites, resources, etc. (giving credit when appropriate). • Contributions to the discussions (posts and responses) should be complete and free of grammatical or structural errors. What do I mean by a substantive post? The following are some ideas to set the stage for substantive participation for the development of your critical thinking skills: 1. Ensure that the posting contributes to the overall discussion thread that is being developed. Your response must contain some reference back to the original discussion question and to the text and/or class materials. Stay on track by always referring back to that original discussion question. 2. Try to use your posting to add value to the discussion. This is more effective than simply responding to meet a requirement. 3. Check to see that the posting expands on the main theme (in the discussion question, or assignment posting). Additional ideas for online participation: • Share a related experience • Comment on others' experiences • Ask students questions about their ideas • Consider an idea being discussed and offer a different perspective on it • Describe an interesting idea from the reading and explain what insights you gained from it • Ask the group a question about the week's reading • Disagree (respectfully, of course) with a point that someone else has made • Discuss a related issue on which you would like some feedback • Describe how you have applied the recent course concepts to your personal/professional life • Share another resource you have used as you explored the course topics Discussion Question Grading Rubric (27 points): Levels of Achievement Criteria Unsatisfactory Needs More Work Satisfactory Exemplary Quality and timeliness of initial post 0 Points No initial post, late initial post, or overly short initial post (fewer than 350 words). 2 Points Initial post submitted on time but was a bit short of the required 350 words and/or did not fully answer all of the questions posed. 4 Points Initial post submitted before the deadline, was 350 words or more, AND adequately answered (in complete sentences) all of the questions posed. 5 Points Initial post submitted before the deadline, was 350 words or more, AND FULLY answered all of the questioned posed in a thorough manner.
