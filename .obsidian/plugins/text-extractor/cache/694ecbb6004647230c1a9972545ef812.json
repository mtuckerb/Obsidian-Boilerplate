The theme of diver- sity in terms of gender and its interplay with mobility and leisure have attracted some scholarly attention. However, research into transgender and gender diverse mobilities and its impact to leisure access remains limited, particularly from non-Western perspectives. This paper endeavors to fill this gap by investigating transgender and gender diverse mobilities in Istanbul, Turkey. Drawing upon 49 qualitative interviews with gender diverse and transgender public transport users in Istanbul, this study contributes to a scholarly dis- cussion exploring the relationship between gender diversity, mobil- ity, and their access to leisure. As such, it furthers the field of gender-oriented leisure. Transgender and gender diverse individuals continue to face significant issues, such as violence, discrimination, and harassment, when using public transport. Based on the experi- ences of the respondents, this paper concludes that driver training and education, and proactive educational messaging around gender minorities in public spaces could significantly improve the comfort and safety of transgender and gender diverse public transport users. ARTICLE HISTORY Received 6 March 2021 Accepted 15 October 2021 KEYWORDS Access to leisure; gender minorities; mobility justice; public transport; transgender mobilities Introduction In the last decade, transgender and gender diverse communities have become increas- ingly visible, particularly, in the Global North. This is partially due to the successful campaigns by international human rights advocacy movements around the globe (Jones et al., 2015). Nonetheless, transgender and gender diverse people continue to experience marginalization and exclusion across all aspects of their lives including the limitations associated with accessing leisure opportunities (Monterrubio et al., 2020; Padilla et al., 2016). Research into transgender and gender diverse mobilities, and their access to leisure opportunities in urban environments remains limited. Particularly, there is a significant lack of such research from non-Western perspectives, especially from countries and \u0001 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC CONTACT Oscar Vorobjovas-Pinta o.pinta@ecu.edu.au School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Western Australia, Australia LEISURE SCIENCES 2024, VOL. 46, NO. 5, 639–657 https://doi.org/10.1080/01490400.2021.2023372 regions where LGBTQIþ 1 individuals are legally and/or socially punishable (Vorobjovas-Pinta & Hardy, 2016). Transphobia, like homophobia, is a product of reli- gious, political and/or state-sponsored manifestations (Vorobjovas-Pinta & Hardy, 2021). Socially and politically engrained homophobia and transphobia often results in risky and unsafe mobilities for vulnerable members of the society. As such, mobility justice attempts to explore the ethical and political issues associated with one’s access to mobility and, more broadly, with their belonging and identity in society (Ilcan, 2013; Sheller, 2018). The intertwined nature and, indeed, the complicated relationship between mobility and discrimination of particular social groups have been recently framed through the lens of privilege, social exclusion, and politics (Benevenuto & Caulfield, 2019; Cook & Butz, 2018; Doughty & Murray, 2016; Hananel & Berechman, 2016; Vorobjovas-Pinta & Hardy, 2021; Weintrob et al., 2021). Drawing upon the concept of mobility justice, this paper is structured around two overarching objectives. Firstly, the paper critically examines the structural, interpersonal, and intrapersonal constraints that transgender and gender diverse people face while engaging in urban leisure in Istanbul, Turkey. By focusing on mobility and accessibility, the paper explores the interrelationship between public transport provision and access to leisure. When investigating such leisure activities, one should understand its intersec- tion with key determinants such as social stigma, which is discrimination against or dis- approval of particular groups of people based on their perceivable social characteristics that distinguish them from other members of the society (Olson & Reddy-Best, 2019). Additionally, while evaluating urban leisure activities, public transport becomes a sig- nificant catalyst in understanding mobility patterns and its impact to urban leisure access. Indeed, the provision of adequate and safe public transport is a key to quality leisure (Gronau & Kagermeier, 2007). Secondly, this paper furthers the field of gender-oriented mobility by offering a more nuanced understanding of gender. Within this context, we include the unique limita- tions and problems of transgender and gender diverse people in the scope of gender- oriented mobility studies. Drawing upon 49 qualitative interviews with transgender and gender diverse public transport users, this paper suggests that to have a successful and comprehensive study of participation in urban leisure and mobility justice, it must include a broader sense of gendered experiences and their impacts on mobility. By linking the abovementioned objectives, we aim to contribute to the ongoing dis- cussion and understanding of the interrelations between social stigma-related con- straints, and mobility justice as experienced by transgender and gender diverse individuals, through their use of public transport to access urban leisure. Theoretical framework and research background Leisure can serve as a vehicle for sustainable community development by contributing to social justice and equity and is, therefore, worthy of detailed analysis in urban areas. The concept of social justice and its relation to leisure access is rather nuanced as it 1The LGBTQI þ acronym stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex and other sexuality and gender identities. The authors of this paper acknowledge the fluidity and complexity of sexualities and gender identities. 640 S. SHAKIBAEI AND O. VOROBJOVAS-PINTA pertains to ‘the specific end state of social change that accounts for power differentials’ (Parry et al., 2013, p. 82). Tourism and leisure literature have explored the notion of social justice and marginalized communities (Jamal & Camargo, 2018; McCabe & Qiao, 2020; Rastegar, 2020; Vorobjovas-Pinta & Hardy, 2021). Similarly, mobilities studies examined the topics pertaining to transport-related social exclusion (Lubitow et al., 2017; Weintrob et al., 2021). However, research into transgender and gender diverse mobilities and its impact to leisure access remains rather limited (Lubitow et al., 2017; Ritterbusch, 2016; Weintrob et al., 2021). Notably, albeit not in leisure context, Lubitow et al. (2017, 2020) investigated the interrelationships between the normalization of vio- lence against transgender and gender diverse individuals and the problems they face using public transport. Indeed, fear of violence, crime, and harassment on and around public transport are some of the contributing factors that prevent transgender and gen- der diverse people from accessing leisure (Weintrob et al., 2021). This paper evaluates the uneven mobility and access of transgender and gender diverse people to urban leisure thorough the lens of social stigma theory. Subsequently, it connects the specific problems of transgender people while accessing leisure on public transport, focusing on inter- and intra- personal scales. Consequently, it challenges the mobility of gender diverse people pivoting around mobility justice issues. The above-mentioned discriminatory practices are deeply rooted in society and nega- tively affect transgender and gender diverse individuals’ socio-economic status and their access to public spaces in Istanbul. All these show that transgender and gender diverse people are stigmatized and negatively perceived in Turkish society which may affect their participation in urban/social activities and their mobility. Public transport and mobility justice Public transport is one of the key components in public spaces. Public transport also plays a key role in providing access to leisure activities in urban environments (Gronau & Kagermeier, 2007). However, violence and other problematic factors in public trans- port have adverse impacts on citizens’ rights to mobility. Scholars have attempted to address issues related to the quality in public transport since early 1990s (De Sousa et al., 2017). Addressing the mobility needs of the population and providing reliable, quality, efficient, and safe public transport should be given a significant thought not only by researchers but also by public transport authorities and government officials. Mobility justice offers one way of understanding the political, cultural, and ethical interpretations associated with accessibility to public transport and, as such, leisure. Sheller (2018, p. 30) defines mobility justice as ‘an overarching concept for thinking about how inequality and power inform the control of movement, shaping the patterns of unequal mobility and immobility in the circulation of people, resources, and informa- tion.’ The nexus of mobility justice and leisure can be explored through the leisure con- straints model. The model (Crawford et al., 1991) suggests that development of an individual’s preference for leisure activities occurs because of micro and macro-level fac- tors encompassing individual motivations and intra- and inter-personal constraints. While approaching the safety factors in public transport, a number of issues, such as harassment, verbal and physical violence, theft, social and political violence, come into LEISURE SCIENCES 641 prominence. Race, gender, age, as well as religious or political beliefs are among those factors motivating such violence. Therefore, understanding violence associated with public transport is an issue of great importance (Ceccato & Uittenbogaard, 2014). Mobilities scholarship explores a wide range of issues pertaining to both daily and local- ized movement patterns, as well as large scale movements of people and objects (Hannam et al., 2006; Hanson, 2010). Literature on the local level of mobility justice investigates the impacts of differential access to resources and power on the potentials of mobility and movement. This literature shows that some minorities and marginalized groups experience forms of immobility (Sheller & Urry, 2006). To evaluate violence and crime on public transport, researchers have used both quali- tative and quantitative methods (De Sousa et al., 2017). Sheller (2018) examines the concept of mobility on a local level by focusing on the flow and dispersal of people, resources and information, as well as on an urban level by critically debating citizens’ rights to public transport and, indeed, the city. Besides, the research explores the issue on a global scale and challenges the elites’ ability to roam freely and contrasts it with people who are seemingly left abandoned and, indeed, “imprisoned” within the set or imaginary borders. Sheller’s(2018) “mobility justice” is a call to rethink the politics of movement. Martens (2012) applies Walzer’s “spheres of justice” to the transport sector. The research advocates for public transport to be accessible for all. The right to use public transport should be independent from the way other resources, such as money and power, are distributed. The research adds a new perspective for evaluating mobility just- ice. It opens a discussion about the social meaning of transport in hyper-mobile soci- eties. It necessitates policies that consider distributive principles and inclusive practices. Gender is one of the key issues in studies exploring inequalities and mobility justice (Iqbal et al., 2020; Maciejewska et al., 2019). Some studies in the field of human geog- raphy suggest that public spaces reproduce gender hierarchies since they are constructed as gender normative and heterosexual (Cresswell & Uteng, 2008; Vorobjovas-Pinta & Hardy, 2016). For instance, Valentine (1993) illustrates this issue through the experien- ces of lesbians who generally find themselves “out of place” in public spaces since these spaces are organized and appropriated by heterosexuals, and so express and reproduce asymmetrical socio-sexual relations. It has also been posited that fear of violence is an inevitable aspect of the gendering of public space (Pain, 1997). Such situations have led to the development of gay spaces – points of coherence for like-minded LGBTQI þ individuals, where one can escape the heteronormative strictures, bullying and animosity (Vorobjovas-Pinta, 2018). However, this is hard to achieve in public spaces, as they are inherently heteronormative, and even heterosexually masculine (Vorobjovas-Pinta & Hardy, 2016). On the other hand, the study by Vorobjovas-Pinta (2018) calls for a resistance of homogenized portrayals of the LGBTQI þ communities not only in the academic inquiry but also in other cultural spheres. Although statistics suggest that men are more likely to be victims of violent crimes (except sexual assault and rape) in public spaces, women report higher rates of fear of violence (May et al., 2010). This perception of potential violence in public spaces affects movement of women and results in limited access to public spaces – making these spaces a territory of men (Dunckel Graglia, 2016; Hollander, 2001). In addition, some 642 S. SHAKIBAEI AND O. VOROBJOVAS-PINTA researchers have evaluated men’s experiences of violence and fear based on their class, color, race, physical abilities and sexual orientation in public spaces (Meyer, 2012; Schafer et al., 2006). It should be noted that majority of the studies exploring violence and access to public spaces focus on cis-gender people. However, the issue of violence and harassment, which are common experiences of transgender and gender diverse individuals in public spaces, has only recently gained some visibility in scholarship (Lubitow et al., 2017). Social stigma theory and leisure constraints theory In this study, we apply both social stigma and leisure constraints theories to evaluate transgender and gender diverse people’s participation in urban leisure activities through the lens of mobility justice on public transport. Social stigma theory refers to discrimin- ation against or disapproval of individuals based on the social factors distinguishing them from the remaining part of society (Kleinman & Hall-Clifford, 2009). As such, stigmatization can be understood as a social process in which individuals with specific characteristics are being labeled, stereotyped, and rejected (Link & Phelan, 2001). Arguably, this is a form of social control. Stigmatization can be conceptualized in terms of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural forms (White Hughto et al., 2015). Manifestations of stigma at the structural level can be asserted by institutional laws, norms of the society and environmental conditions. These factors may restrict stigma- tized people’s access to wellbeing, resources, social activities, and opportunities (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2010). For example, transgender and gender diverse individuals lack support in health insurance coverage and the right to access tertiary education in Turkey (Akg€un, 2019). In its interpersonal form, stigma can be associated with beliefs and societal norms that may have an adverse impact on stigmatized people’s interac- tions with others. For example, one might express violence against transgender or gen- der diverse people simply because such violence has become a societal norm. Finally, an important aspect of social stigmatization, which can shape stigmatized individuals’ self- understanding, is intrapersonal level of stigma. In this context, certain factors, such as dressing style, sexual orientation, might instinctively generate avoidance and shame in regard to adopted and internalized stereotypes (Madera et al., 2019). Leisure constraints theory focuses on the relationships between leisure preferences and barriers/constraints (Godbey et al., 2010). In the last couple of decades, numerous studies have addressed constraints that restrict participation in leisure activities (Huber et al., 2018; Hudson & Gilbert, 2000; Theriault, 2014). Constraints in leisure which are generally based on gender, race, and age (Gao & Kerstetter, 2016) have a dynamic nature influencing individuals’ recreational choices, activities and travel behavior. When it comes to the study of leisure activities in transgender and gender diverse populations in Istanbul, it should be noted that entertainment sector including bars, discos, night clubs, pubs beside its leisure entity, are one of the (rare) fields in which many trans- gender and gender diverse people are actively participating or employed (Luhur & Engin, 2020). Therefore, their commuting patterns and transport modes should be studied in their own right. Transgender and gender diverse people’s involvement in leis- ure activities, mobility equity while accessing these activities, and constraints can be LEISURE SCIENCES 643 evaluated in a general framework with the overlap of structural, interpersonal, and intrapersonal constrains. Study context: public transport and gender minorities in Istanbul Istanbul is a megacity in Turkey that straddles Asia and Europe. The population of the city is approximately 16 million. As such, public transport is vital to the everyday com- mute. Public transport comprises multiple rail systems, bus and mini-bus networks, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), maritime services, aerial cable car lines and funiculars. Metro Istanbul is a public enterprise controlled by the metropolitan municipality with six existing and four planned/under construction metro (by the time of writing this paper) and light rail lines. Total length of the rail system is 233 km, where Metro Istanbul operates 154 km of it (Metro Istanbul, 2019). The remaining part belongs to the Marmaray rail line which is controlled by the Turkish State Railways (TCDD). BRT, which is also known as “Metrob€us”, extends in east-west axis of the city with a length of 52 km connecting the Asian and the European parts of Istanbul. In terms of the mar- ine transport, there are 17 ferry-lines on the shores of Marmara Sea and Bosporus. BRT provides a 24-hour nonstop service. All rail facilities operate between 06:00 and 00:00 during weekdays. However, on weekends the major facilities controlled by Metro Istanbul operate 24-hours. LGBTQI þ individuals in Istanbul may face legal challenges, discrimination, harass- ment and even violence from their relatives, neighbors, coworkers, teachers, and even the police (Luhur & Engin, 2020). The intention of the Turkish Government to join the European Union has put some pressure on the government to recognize LGBTQI þ rights (Kara & C¸alık, 2016). In this context, Turkey became the first Muslim-majority country in which a gay pride was held since 2003. However, this has been banned by the government since 2015 due to potential or imagined security and cultural concerns (Kara & C¸alık, 2016). In Turkey, individuals belonging to gender and sexual minority groups prefer to move to and live in big cities, such as Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. This phenomenon was confirmed in our study, where around half of the respondents moved to Istanbul from other parts of the country or even internationally. This is highly motivated by the belief that they can live more freely and express their lifestyle preferences in a much bigger city. Istanbul is a multi-central megacity with 39 municipalities with no formally established queer neighborhood. Anecdotally, districts such as Tarlabasi, Aksaray, and some parts of Sisli host a higher proportion of LGBTQI þ population. Scope of the interviews The data for this study derives from 49 in-depth interviews with transgender and gen- der diverse public transport users in Istanbul. Data collection took place over the period of nine months in 2019 and 2020. To satisfy the criteria for this study, respondents had to self-identify as transgender or gender diverse and use public transport in Istanbul at least 3–4 times a week. The pilot interview in June 2019 included seven respondents belonging to an LGBTQI þ association. The remaining respondents were approached 644 S. SHAKIBAEI AND O. VOROBJOVAS-PINTA through either a snow-balling technique or by using a match-making smartphone appli- cation MeetMe, which is popular among the LGBTQI þ individuals in Turkey. This resulted in a diverse range of participants in terms of their gender identity, socio-eco- nomic status, and residency. Participants’ age ranges between 20 and 54. Except for the pilot interview, which was a group conversation, the remaining inter- views were conducted on a one-on-one basis and were audio-recorded. The interviews were conducted in Turkish and translated by the lead author of this paper. To ensure participants’ safety and comfort, the face-to-face interviews with 42 participants took place at a LGBTQI þ space in Istanbul (a local LGBTQI þ association), whereas 7 inter- views were conducted over a phone. No real names were collected. Figure 1 and Table 1 summarize demographics and some additional information of the respondents. In order to protect participants’ identity, this study uses gender-neutral aliases. By asking the participants about their car ownership, it was uncovered that partici- pants who were employed in underground economies, particularly prostitution, did not own a car. They discussed their dependency on public transport facilities. Some of the respondents identified that they have male procurers who own a car; as such, these par- ticipants could access a private car in case of need. Figure 1. Socio-demographics of participants (a) car ownership (b) education level (c) employment (d) income level. LEISURE SCIENCES 645 Methodologically, each interview started by asking the respondents to freely talk about their gender and their background. This has made the participants to feel at ease with the interview process and helped to build a rapport between the participants and the researcher (Vorobjovas-Pinta & Robards, 2017). Interviews deliberately did not start with a rigid and preexisting set of questions allowing the interviewees to feel comfort- able and be more conversational, the opposite approach could have adversely affected the interview process (Doan, 2016). However, each interview concluded by asking for the respondents’ age, nationality, education, employment, income level and car Table 1. Demographics of the participants.

The average dur- ation of interviews was approximately 30 minutes. The interviewer and the lead author of this paper was a cis-gender man. The paper has been co-written with a researcher who identifies as gay man. Interviews were analyzed thematically identifying and organizing the emerging themes across the data (Patton, 2002). The aim here was to find out what were the experiences of transgender and gender diverse people using public transport. Thematic analysis is a useful and flexible method, as it is not grounded in any preexisting theoret- ical framework (Kjaran & J\u0002ohannesson, 2013). As such, it provides a useful research tool for analyzing rich and complex data. Following thematic analysis, the themes were further reviewed, defined, and named (Patton, 2002). The following three themes were identified: passerby-caused harassment and discrimination; passenger-caused harassment and discrimination; and public transport employee-caused harassment and discrimination. Findings: violence, harassment, and discrimination on public transport Public transport is an integral part of urban life for many individuals living in Istanbul. However, transgender and gender diverse individuals using public transport face dis- crimination on a daily basis. As part of the interview schedule, participants were asked to express their memorable negative and positive experiences when using public trans- port. Almost all participants recalled a range of negative experiences and memories per- taining to discrimination, violence or harassment. The negative experiences ranged from low level harassment, such as finger-pointing and name-calling to instances of physical assault. 44 participants could recall at least one case of violence, discrimination or har- assment triggered by cissexism. Cissexism is defined as an assumption that cis people’s gender identities, expressions, and embodiments are more natural and legitimate than those of transgender or gender diverse people (Serano, 2007). Notably, two out of five participants who did not experience negative actions on public transport were foreigners - a Russian gender diverse person and a Ukrainian transgender woman. In many cases, the victimization of the participants was based on their public appearance as non-bin- ary. Participants who were seeking to conceal their gender identity were less likely to be exposed to harassment and violence on public transport. However, many respondents were unable or un-willing to express and conform to the normative notions of gender. Passerby-caused harassment and discrimination Bus and tram stops can be challenging and problematic for transgender and gender diverse individuals. Most of the bus stops in Istanbul are simply marked by a road sign on the sidewalk and some others have glass or plastic shelters. As such, people at bus stops are highly visible to the passersby. Minibuses are even more problematic as they do not have formal stops, which means that they can pick up and drop off passengers wherever needed. In Istanbul, most buses have schedules so that average waiting time is around 10–30 minutes during the daytime. However, the frequency of buses decreases LEISURE SCIENCES 647 remarkably toward the nighttime and the headway for 24-hours services are mostly more than an hour. This section predominantly focuses on the experiences of violence and harassment against gender minorities at bus stops or train platforms. Gray, a transgender woman, narrates her experience that clarifies the vulnerability of gender minorities while waiting at a bus stop: It was Friday, around 11:30pm and we were waiting for the bus at S¸is¸hane station. In fact, two of my trans friends and I left the party of another trans friend to catch the last bus [ … ]. The bus stop was crowded. A luxury car with deafening music approached the bus stop and came to a sudden stop just ahead of us. There were two idiots in the car yelling at us asking “How much do you three prostitutes get for a night-long stand with us?” They were drunk, yelling at us and laughing like evil. Ironically, other passengers waiting for their buses started to cuss us out, blaming us. Some elderly passengers and a young woman beside her husband/boyfriend were complaining in a nagging voice that “prostitutes like you break up families.” There were other young girls around, who were “dressed to kill”, but only we drew the criticism because of our gender which was evident because of our tone of voice and height. At that moment, I wished that the ground would swallow me up. Anyway, we took a taxi and moved away. Every time I wait for a bus, I unavoidably remember [it] and feel angry. Sam, a gender diverse person, similarly agrees that bus stops and train platforms are potential locations for gender-related violence and discrimination. A few years ago, when I was a university student, I was frequently using 141M bus to go to the university. Normally, I did not have any contact with those waiting at the bus stop or on the bus. One day, I was in a hurry trying to catch the bus. A few seconds before my arrival at station, a bus left the bus stop and I did not recognize whether it was 141M or not. I approached the nearest one waiting for bus at the station asking whether she has seen the bus number. She suddenly started to tell bad words to me: “Get the hell out! I never talk to characterless idiots like you. Look at his girl dressing. Are you human? Is such a manner and dressing acceptable in our culture? Aren’t you ashamed?” I really did not understand what my guilt was. I did not humiliate anyone. I did not harm public order. I experienced such a sad, violent and discriminatory behavior only because of my appearance and preferences”. Eleven other participants reported similar instances of verbal abuse while waiting at bus stops. In their opinion, the hatred toward transgender and gender diverse individu- als is triggered by transphobia, people’s religious beliefs, lack of education, as well as lack of serious government measures preventing and punishing such behavior. In gen- eral, the rail infrastructure such as stations and platforms, the visibility of the security officers, reliability of schedules and shorter waiting times contributed to participants reporting less violence or discrimination while waiting for trains compared to waiting for buses. Passenger-caused harassment and discrimination The overwhelming majority of cases of violence and harassment against gender minor- ities occur onboard the busses and trains. 37 participants reported various forms of abuse, harassment and violence including but not limited to passing sexual comments, catcalling, indecent gestures, “flashing” and sexual assault. Most participants believed 648 S. SHAKIBAEI AND O. VOROBJOVAS-PINTA that this is due to the absence of staff such as conductors or security officers on the bus or train. Courtney, a 30-year old gender diverse individual, who works at a night-club, recalled an incident that took place on BRT while taking a long trip from Kadık€oy to Beylikd€uz€u (50 kilometers, a one-hour one-way trip): It was Sunday, around 3:00-3:30am. I was on my way from a night-club to my sibling’s home. I got on the BRT towards backside of the bus. There were 10-15 passengers, most of them were staring at me [ … ]. Passengers were getting off the bus along the way and at Sefak€oy station we were only two remaining passengers. We were sitting face to face with a distance of 3-5 meters between us. He was like a “bearish” man with a huge knife scar on his face. My God, I could hardly believe my eyes. He started to masturbate calmly, staring at me with a demonic smile. I could not even imagine how he dared doing this. Anyway, I suddenly got off the bus in the next station. Although I knew there were security cameras on the bus, I did not even want to make a complaint about the issue to the police or transport officers. I was sure that everyone would blame me for my outfit, gender and question what I was doing outside at that time of the night. [ … ] from that time on I stand or sit in close proximity to the driver. It was not my first bad experience and I am sure it will not be the last one. This is Istanbul! Another unpleasant case was reported by Lennox and Morgan while using M-2 metro line. They are transgender women and flat mates. We did our shopping for our forthcoming party at a mall in S¸is¸li district and walked to the metro to go home. Accidentally, there was a football match between “Galatasaray” and another club in the Turkish football league. When we arrived at the underground metro platform, there was a congested crowd of “Galatasary” fans waiting for metro to go to the stadium. They were mostly dressed in team jerseys. When the metro arrived, we saw that a similar atmosphere was dominant on the train. The fans were whistling and shouting slogans in favor of “Galatasaray” and anti-rival insulting slogans. We were in the middle of this crowd where a young fan with his group of friends which were shouting noticed us and talked among themselves. They suddenly started shouting a common and known slogan which includes bad and comic words against individuals like us. Within 10-15 seconds the whole train was shouting the same slogan and laughing at us. I am sure that 99% of the passengers did not even know why they were shouting such an irrelevant slogan. Fortunately, we did not face any physical harassment, but this has shown us how our society can easily humiliate individuals like us in a scoffing manner. Justice, an Iranian transgender woman living in Istanbul, noted her experience of dis- crimination. In fact, other two foreign participants did not report any unpleasant cases of harassment. They even stated that when it comes to respect and understanding, Istanbul is far better than their respective hometowns. However, Justice did not agree with them. I was on the bus in a district which was famous for its conservative and religious neighborhoods. It was the end of the business day and the bus was almost full. I was standing next to the window, looking outside. I felt I was touched 1-2 times, but I thought it was not a deliberate touch in that crowd. However, after a few more touches I recognized that there is a guy trying to rest against me. I got really angry and shouted at him. What happened afterwards?! Yes, you guessed it right. I was thrown out of the bus into the street and the guy was allowed to continue. My only fault was being outside of the perceived society’s norms based on my appearance. LEISURE SCIENCES 649 In addition to the aforementioned cases, most of the participants reported some other similar experiences. They were mostly disturbed by passengers trying to take photo- graphs of them. For example, Logan, a gender diverse person, accidently came across a picture of them taking metro as a profile photo of an anonymous user in a matchmak- ing application. Another aspect experienced by many participants was disrespectful and intense looks from mostly elderly passengers. Many participants also reported that women with children tend to look at them as if they are “monsters”. They proactively distract their children to avoid making the eye contact. Public transport employee-caused harassment and discrimination Violence and harassment on public transport usually originate from the passengers on the bus or train and from the passersby whilst waiting for a public transport. However, a small number of participants reported cases of discrimination and verbal harassment from public transport employees such as drivers, operators, security officers and fare- checkers. Although the participants recalled several instances of minor negative experi- ences such as being misgendered (e.g., a trans woman being referred to as “sir”), four participants reported verbal or more serious harassment from public transport employ- ees. This suggests that public transport employees are mostly duty-bound and explains the participants’ call for more staff on public transport and stops. River, a young transgender woman, stated that bus drivers do not make any effort to protect public transport users like her in case of violence or assault. I was on bus 97-M, going to work. I was standing just beside an elderly couple (they were sitting) who were giving me the “stink-eye”. Gradually, they behaved rudely and started to say very impolite and transphobic things straight to my face. Other passengers around were only looking. I decided to report it to the driver and when I did that, his reaction was intolerable. He said: “I think they are not wrong. You are lucky that you have not been touched [ … ] by passengers”. I immediately got off the bus and realized that public authorities must apply diversity training to the drivers and to all other transport employees. Drivers should know how and when to intervene. They cannot remain indifferent”. Quinn, a 40-years old gender diverse individual, elaborated on a verbal harassment committed by a mini-bus driver in Esenler. I was once walking down the street with another [gender diverse] friend when a minibus driver pulled over his vehicle full of passengers and catcalled. He continued for 10- 15 seconds but no one from the passerby reacted. We are generally the target of catcalls and people mostly think we have to accept it because of our gender. Tatum, a transgender woman, discussed her case of discrimination committed by a woman bus driver. Cis-female bus drivers are uncommon in the city. I was alone waiting for the bus and I saw that my bus was coming. As the bus was approaching the station, I noticed that the driver is a woman. It was so interesting for me because it was my first time seeing a woman bus driver on the streets of Istanbul. She reached the stop, looked at me, probably found something strange [about me] and left without opening the door. Cameron, a gender diverse individual, also reported a problematic case with a woman security officer on ‘Marmaray’ metro line. Marmaray is the longest rail line in Istanbul 650 S. SHAKIBAEI AND O. VOROBJOVAS-PINTA stretching from ‘Halkalı’ on the European side of the city to ‘Gebze’ at the edge of the Asian part (76 kilometers, a 115-minute one-way trip). I arrived at the platform heading towards ‘Halkalı’ direction. I was going to a shopping mall in ‘Florya’. The longer trip services between Halkalı and Gebze had just recently started and the information on whether the train is going to ‘Halkalı’ or not was not clear. So, I decided to enquire the officers about the next train service. I approached a woman officer and I asked whether the coming train is passing through ‘Florya’ or not. She looked at me and replied in an angry way: “I do not know, and I do not have to answer.” She then turned her back and moved away. Discussion While mobility is often associated with freedom and progress (Cresswell, 2010), some groups of people continue to experience uneven access to it. This study finds that trans- gender and gender diverse individuals face discrimination, violence, and harassment while accessing and using public transport in Istanbul. This in turn limits their mobility and, as such, access to leisure. Indeed, mobility rights, ethics and justice have become critical in the field of mobility justice (Sheller, 2011), yet there has been a significant lack of such attention pertaining to the transgender and gender diverse communities using public transport. We argue that the causes associated with the negative experien- ces stemming from the usage of public transport spaces are triggered by social stigma. In this case, the social stigma is inadvertently connected to ‘politics of mobility’ (Cresswell, 2010), which attempts to articulate the intersection of mobility and justice. Social stigma is rooted in Turkish society’s cultural, social, and religious ideals where people that do not conform to their assigned gender-at-birth are marginalized (Lennon & Mistler, 2014). Transgender and gender diverse study participants frequently experi- ence vulnerable situations such as verbal and physical violence and discrimination while using public transport. Transphobia is experienced in leisure, urban mobility, and travel contexts. This has synergies with Lubitow et al. (2017) study who found that gender diverse people would often schedule their itineraries around times and transport routes that are safer and less problematic. Rejection, violence and discrimination against transgender and gender diverse popula- tion are rooted in social stigma and its structural, interpersonal, and intrapersonal con- texts. From a sociological perspective, structural constraints encompass a wide range of social, cultural, political, and economic factors that constrict individuals’ ability to make decisions (Monterrubio et al., 2020). These constraints shape the interpersonal barriers which gradually transform to intrapersonal constraints. From a mobility justice perspec- tive, the individual mobility should not be limited by social constraints such as threats of violence (Sheller, 2008). Importantly, fear of being victimized feeds into the issues associated with wellbeing of transgender and gender diverse communities (Weintrob et al., 2021). Arguably, there is an inherent link between one’s wellbeing and mobility justice. Interviews with the participants suggest that transgender individuals are fully aware of sociocultural and economic conditions in which they live. Around 75% of the respondents do not prefer to use public transport in the mornings and in the evening rush hours, as well as late at night. They also do not participate in leisure activities that take place in the areas and destinations known for their transphobic reputation. As LEISURE SCIENCES 651 such, the individual mobility of transgender and gender diverse people is restricted by heteronormative strictures and regimes. Another issue of a great importance is gendered facilities in leisure or entertainment places such as malls, clubs, etc. and public transport hubs such as metro stations. For instance, almost all transgender women report problems associated with misgendering, particularly when accessing public toilets. This is in line with the findings by Lubitow et al. (2017) and Weintrob et al. (2021) who suggest that transgender and gender diverse individuals suffer most from acts of harassment. Many participants also feel unsafe when using public transport in groups; even though they mostly travel to engage in leisure activities as one group. As for interpersonal context, major problematic cases stem from verbal and physical violence, as well as other forms of discrimination. This form of abuse toward transgender and gender diverse people mostly originates from other passengers on-board, passersby at stations and, in rare cases, from public trans- port employees. Most participants report frequent cases of negative experiences coming from other passengers, passersby or employees while moving through the city on public transport. Although the isolated and controlled space of trains, platforms, bus, and bus stops may potentially decrease the risk of severe physical violence and harassment, normalization of the negative experiences may have permanent impacts on gender minorities. Thus, such violence, discrimination and harassment must be minimized since these negative experiences may limit the mobility potential of transgender and gender diverse individu- als. Many participants routinely reconsider or avoid trips on certain public transport lines, especially while traveling in groups during daytime or traveling alone at night. This has a severe impact on their access to leisure. Practical implications The final 5–10 minutes of the interviews were dedicated for a loose brainstorming around potential recommendations that could enhance safety for transgender and gen- der diverse public transport users in Istanbul. Besides some personal strategies to man- age negative experiences, a range of policies and practices were suggested to increase the safety of gender minorities on public transport. In summary, the recommendations could be classified as follows: (1) driver training and education; (2) proactive educa- tional-messaging around gender minorities; (3) utilization of smart phone applications and web-based approaches; (4) gradual cultural shift and education; and (5) control and observation measures. Some participants report that while they were violated or harassed by other passen- gers, the drivers often did not intervene, or they did not know how to manage such sit- uations in an effective way. Thus, public transport agencies, whether operated by the public or private sectors, should train their drivers and employees around gender identi- ties and the potential challenges gender minorities face. An essential step in advance- ment of safety for gender diverse public transport users would be knowing that public transport employees, including drivers, acknowledge them and the discrimination they experience. The employees should be trained to de-escalate or resolve problematic situa- tions. The drivers and other employees within the public transport sector, should make 652 S. SHAKIBAEI AND O. VOROBJOVAS-PINTA an effort to use gender-neutral language when communicating with transgender and gender diverse individuals. Public transport agencies should promote the visibility of transgender and gender diverse individuals through proactive messaging, signs, advertisement, and other digital or printed materials on public transport. Participants in this study unanimously believe that their social rights and nation-wide acceptance is a matter of education. In this context, the safety issue on public transport is not only related to the prevention of violence and harassment, but it also pertains to a wider cultural and societal change. Participants note that Turkey’s educational system, weakness of laws protecting gender minorities, society’s cultural norms and family structures pave the way for the perpetration of violence against gender minorities in public spaces, including public transport. Another strategy that participants believe would increase their safety on public trans- port is the presence of security measures such as CCTV, panic alarm buttons on buses and trains, fixed and random patrols in and around stations and means of transport by uniformed and plain-clothed officers. In contrast to the findings of a similar study in Portland, Oregon by Lubitow et al. (2020), transgender and gender diverse public trans- port users in Istanbul would feel safer if there was an increase of visible presence of transport officers and other security measures. Lastly, some participants note that long inter-station distances in some lower socio-economic and more conservative neighbor- hoods increased the risk of harassment and violence. Individuals belonging to gender minorities are exposed to such threats while walking to their destination after getting off the bus. Thus, adding more bus stops in these neighborhoods might be another pre- ventive measure. Concluding remarks, future research and limitations By exploring mobility justice of transgender and gender diverse communities through the angle of social stigma and leisure constraints theories, we further mobility justice theory in two ways. Firstly, we argue that identities of the participants can shape their mobility experiences and access to urban leisure; and, secondly, we affirm that social stigma and leisure constraints theories are useful approaches in exploring mobility just- ice for marginalized groups of people. We find a wide range of routine experiences of violence, discrimination, and harassment among the participants of this study. The major sources of such violence and harassment are other passengers, public transport employees including drivers and security staff as well as other members of the public. On the other hand, the lack of appropriate infrastructure (e.g., public toilets in metro stations), exacerbates the problems transgender and gender diverse individuals routinely face. The diversity of these sources suggests that spatial components of public transport encompassing inner spaces of trains and buses, bus stops and train platforms are not that different from other non-institutional public spaces. Therefore, future research should also evaluate the cultural, social, and environmental factors inciting violence and discrimination against gender minorities in public spaces. From a theoretical perspective, discrimination whilst waiting for a public transport could be further explored through the mobilities literature on waiting (e.g., Bissell, LEISURE SCIENCES 653 2007; Cresswell, 2012). This would add another layer of perception of accessibility in the fields of transportation, urban planning, and leisure. Within this context, the term “accessibility” must not be limited only to its physical form of transportation among different transport modes in the city. In addition, it must contain mobility justice for all marginalized and minority groups making public transport truly accessible for everyone. Such achievement would have synergies with UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 11 addressing sustainable cities and communities, and Goal 5 focusing on gender equality (United Nations, 2015). To date most of the studies explor- ing gender-based mobility and access to leisure relate to the differences in mobilities and leisure participation among cis-gender women and men. This does not reflect the wider entity of gender studies. Experiences of transgender and gender diverse individu- als must be part of it in order to further improve the extant concepts. As with any research, the findings presented in this paper should be considered in light of some limitations. Firstly, this study was conducted in Turkey, where transgender and gender diverse people experience overt public and governmental disapproval and discrimination (Luhur & Engin, 2020). As such, the experiences of our participants might not be the same as of those transgender and gender diverse people living in other (e.g., Global North) countries. Future research could offer comparative studies from other regions in the world. Secondly, this paper offered some practical recommenda- tions, however these are based purely on the interviews with the participants, public and private transport companies were not interviewed. Future research could explore the perceptions of these stakeholders. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the participants of the interviews. Their participation has greatly enhanced the understanding of the topic. This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
