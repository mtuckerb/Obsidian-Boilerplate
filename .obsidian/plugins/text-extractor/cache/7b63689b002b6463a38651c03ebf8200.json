Scanlan* Over half o f the United States population currently lives near a coast. As shorelines are used by more people, developed by private owners, and altered by extreme weather, competition over access to water and beaches will intensify, as will the need for a clearer legal theory capable o f accommodating competing private and public interests. One such public interest is the ability to walk along the beach, which seems simple enough. However, beach walking often occurs on this ambulatory shoreline where public rights grounded in the public trust doctrine and private rights grounded in property ownership intersect. To varying degrees, each state has a public trust doctrine that defines public rights on beaches. The extent to which a court subscribes to a sovereignty theory influences the outcome for public rights. Under this theory, the public trust doctrine is an attribute o f state sovereignty, and as such, the states lack the power to eliminate it. Applying a sovereignty theory leads courts to conceptualize public trust rights as an inalienable easement that burdens coastal private property, regardless o f its omission in the recorded deed. Courts that interpret coastal property in this way allow for a coexistence o f public and private rights that accommodates shared uses o f the beach, consistent with centuries o f English common law. In contrast, courts that theorize that state power includes the power to transfer public trust property into private ownership free o f public rights view the public trust doctrine as an ownership doctrine, drawing a distinct line in the sand dividing public use from private fee simple estates. These courts tend to favor exclusive use o f the beach by private landowners, asserting that the dividing line for title purposes is also the boundary for all public rights. This Article examines divergent approaches to public access to beaches across the United States, demonstrates how legal theory influences substantive public and private rights, and discusses takings considerations on beaches. The Article suggests that public and private interests are best served by a historically grounded sovereignty theory—recognizing that a public trust easement always burdens coastal private titles—coupled with a theory o f evolving public rights. These background principles not only protect shared uses o f the beach, but also provide greater clarity regarding what constitutes a taking o f coastal property. I.

In t r o d u c t io n In a Wisconsin village on Lake Michigan’s coast, private property owners asked the village to fence off the beach to keep the public out.1 Just across the Lake, adjacent to Michigan’s Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, a homeowners’ association posted signs declaring the beach to be private property.2 3 Moving out from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Ocean, the Los Angeles Urban Rangers educated the public about beach access and how to react to private property owners’ efforts to dissuade the public from reaching the beach in Malibu, such as hiring private security guards and posting faux “private property” signs that adorn parking spaces and access roads/’ On the Atlantic 1.

On May 10, 2011, the Author observed the posted signs while visiting Michigan’s Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. 3.

The Los Angeles Urban Rangers take groups on beach tours in which: [They] instruct their participants to stake out spots on public easements—the patch of sand between the ocean and private property that the public is legally permitted to occupy. Easements can be difficult to discern because they literally shift with the tide— 2013] Public Access and Private Property Along the Coast 297 Ocean, a small business owner litigated a case to the Supreme Court of Maine to obtain recognition of the public right to simply cross the tidelands to scuba dive.* * * 4 Beaches, whether they are along oceans or lakes, constitute an example of contentious property where private interests bump up against public interests.5 Like other shared commons,6 beaches can be public spaces that seem private, become private, or have no public access.7 Conversely, coastal property owners may perceive beaches as private spaces in danger of redefinition as shared public spaces by eminent domain, by easements, or—unconstitutionally—through takings without just compensation.8 In legal terms, the questions are: Does the public retain the right to use the beach despite the legal title held by private landowners? Does private title determine all rights, or does private title to the beach contain inherent limitations in favor of the public? The answers to these legal questions are influenced by whether a court subscribes to a “sovereignty theory” of public trust property that restricts a state’s power to privatize trust property and eliminate public rights. As a general matter of property law across the United States, ownership of the dry uplands above the ordinary or mean high-water mark9 is private and the official boundary is the mean high-tide line over the last several months. Once situated, participants are asked to perform typical ‘beach activities,’ such as yoga, building sand castles and reading trashy magazines. The intent, according to the Rangers, is for people to exercise their right to be on the beach as demonstratively as possible. David Ng, Urban Rangers on 'Safari' in L.A., L.A.

T im e s , June 13, 2013, at A14 (revealing that, even though the beaches of Malibu are public, only about seven of the twenty-seven miles of Malibu beaches are accessible by the public, and homeowners go to great lengths to make it appear that the beaches are private). 8.

See, e.g., N.C. GEN. St a t . § 77-20 (2011) (“The seaward boundary of all property within the State of North Carolina, not owned by the State, which adjoins the ocean, is the mean high-water mark.”); IDAHO CODE A n n . § 58-1302 (2012) (‘“Natural or ordinary high-water mark’ means the high water elevation in a lake over a period of years . . . . ”). Mean high- and low-water mark are generally employed when discussing ocean beaches, while ordinary high- and low-water mark are generally used to refer to lake beaches. See JACK H. ARCHER ET AL., THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE AND THE M a n a g e m e n t o f A m e r ic a ’s C o a s t s 15 (1994). Because this Article discusses cases from oceans and lakes, the Author attempts to avoid confusion from these different terms of art by simply calling this zone between ordinary or mean high- and low-water marks the “public/private beach zone.” 298 S o u t h C a r o l in a L a w R e v ie w [VOL. 65: 295 established in the upland owner’s fee to the land.10 Likewise, ownership below the mean or ordinary low-water mark of tidal or “navigable” 1 waters is uniformly in the state, and the public’s right to use the water in the oceans and navigable lakes and rivers is rarely contested.12 However, the zone between the ordinary or mean high- and low-water marks, referred to as the “public/private beach zone” in this Article, is subject to variable state interpretations of property rights that impact public access and private rights on the beach.12 In some states, the private owner of the upland takes title all the way to the low-water mark.14 However, in most states, private property stops at the high-water mark, and the public has the fee below this line—subject to certain private riparian or littoral rights.13 This public/private beach zone, as well as the scope of public rights within it, is the primary focus of this Article. The narrowness of this strip of beach belies the complexity and controversy that accompany it.16 Rules governing coastal property boundaries and legal rights are complex because of the variation among states17 in types of water bodies, navigability determinations, and alterations based on nature and climate change—water level 10. See Kenneth K. Kilbert, The Public Trust Doctrine and the Great Lakes Shores, 58 CLEV. St. L. REV. 1,17 (2010). However, in states like New Jersey and Oregon, the upland owner’s fee does not include the right to exclude. See Matthews v. Bay Head Improvement Ass’n, 471 A.2d 355, 365 (N.J. 1984) (basing its holding on the public trust doctrine); State ex rel. Thornton v. Hay, 462 P.2d 671, 673, 678 (Or. 1969) (basing its holding on custom instead of the public trust doctrine). 11. Navigable, as it is used here, means navigable for title waters. Rivers “are navigable in fact when they are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.” The Daniel Ball, 77 U.S. (10 Wall.) 557, 563 (1870). While uncommon, a few states—such as Arizona—have gone to great lengths to define most of the waters within their borders as non-navigable and not held in trust by the state. See Defenders of Wildlife v. Hull, 18 P.3d 722, 737 (Ariz. Ct.

After a storm altered a beach on the Gulf of Mexico so dramatically that the homes were completely seaward of the vegetation line, the State of Texas ordered the private property owners to remove the homes from the public beach.

The no takings/compensation rule does not apply to waters made navigable by a private owner’s expense and alterations. Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 179—80 (1979) (holding that imposing a navigational servitude on a marina that was created and rendered navigable through private expense constituted a taking when the area had originally been a pond that was not considered navigable). This federal power under the navigational servitude to destroy property free of a takings claim is similar to the takings immunity enjoyed by the states pursuant to the public trust doctrine.

The Article argues for theories of state sovereignty, property, and public rights that strike a balance between being historically grounded, yet flexible enough to meet the demands of contemporary society. When new states entered the Union on equal footing with the original thirteen states, the federal government transferred title to the new states over the submerged lands beneath all navigable and tidal waters within their boundaries up to the ordinary or mean high-water mark.\"7 To varying degrees, each state 24.

Jordan, 140 U.S. 371, 381 (1891) (stating that when the federal government granted newly formed states title to submerged land, the boundary for the title was from the submerged land to the high-water mark). The rule that states hold title to navigable and tidal waters in their sovereign capacity has its origins in English common law. PPL Mont., LLC v. Montana, 132 S. Ct. 1215, 1226 (2012). In PPL Montana, the Supreme Court noted that, under the equal footing doctrine, “a State’s title to these 2013] P u b l ic A c c e s s a n d P r iv a t e P r o p e r t y A l o n g t h e C o a s t 301 has defined a public trust doctrine under state law to govern the management of these waters and the lands underlying them.28 Many states ground their public trust doctrine in English common law.29 However, as in property law more generally, states diverge regarding the rights inherent in coastal private property titles and the degree to which private titles are, and always have been, subject to a public trust easement.30 Specifically, in determining public rights on beaches, states define the property at issue and the activities protected as public rights.31 A state that bases its public trust doctrine on English common law and an easement theory of overlapping rights in the public/private beach zone will protect the public’s right to walk freely along beaches.’\" In contrast, states that ground their property rights in state law— without regard to English common law precedent—are more likely to draw a distinct line in the sand between public and private titles and favor exclusive use of the shoreline by private landowners.33 Thus, the key difference is whether courts view the dividing line for title purposes as the boundary for all public rights or whether courts recognize a public trust easement overlapping the private title.34 The meta-theory driving a court’s decision to use a lineal title or an easement approach considers whether the public trust doctrine is an attribute of state sovereignty such that it is beyond the power of the state to redefine public trust property as private property and eliminate public rights.35 lands was conferred not by Congress but by the Constitution itself.” Id. at 1227 (quoting Oregon ex rel.

'7 One might assume that courts adopting a fixed seventeenth century approach to public rights would also adopt a more historically grounded approach to the property line question. However, the opposite is true: courts adopting a fixed approach to public rights adopt a lineal title approach to the property boundary that is not based on English common law.3s For those courts, the common thread is a focus on establishing fixed property lines and rights.39 This Article examines public access to beaches across the United States and demonstrates how a court’s choice of legal theory influences the outcome. For instance, even when comparing two states that identically draw the private property boundary at the low-water mark, the outcome for public rights differs based on the theories undergirding courts’ decisions. Part II frames the Article by describing current controversies over beach access and the importance of coastal areas. Part III turns to the historical origins of beach property and the public trust doctrine in the United States and England. To provide context to current controversies and the sovereignty meta-theory, this Part describes the equal footing doctrine and the federal government’s transfer of navigable waters and their beds up to the ordinary or mean high-water mark to each state as it entered the Union. Part IV identifies the competing legal theories courts apply to resolve beach access controversies. Part V analyzes court decisions that apply these theories to beach property. This Part clusters the case analysis around states that come from the same legal foundation, such as the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the Northwest Territories. It then explains the role of takings claims 36. Compare Bell v. Town of Wells (Bell II), 557 A.2d 168, 179 (Me. 1989) (declaring legislation that gave the public the right to use private littoral owners’ intertidal land for purposes other than fishing, fowling, and navigation was an unconstitutional taking), with Borough of Neptune City v.

Part VI suggests public and private interests are best served by a historically grounded sovereignty theory recognizing that a public trust easement burdens coastal property, coupled with a theory of evolving public rights. These background principles inform the coexistence of private and public rights on coastal properties, which lessens the need to discern the particulars of specific deeds or account for variations in boundary drawing by each state. Such a framework alerts property owners to the contingent and variable nature of coastal property and allows the law to more nimbly adapt to contemporary challenges, rather than remain ossified in a context that has long since passed. II. Conflicts on the Sand A walk along a beach seems simple enough—and yet, if the walk is taken on a beach to which another holds title, it may result in a lawsuit or criminal prosecution for trespass.40 The United States Supreme Court decided over one hundred years ago, and affirmed most recently in PPL Montana, LLC v. Montana, 1 that all states entered the union as sovereign owners of the beds of tidal and navigable waters for the use and enjoyment of the public.42 Although a variety of states recognize the public’s right to walk and recreate along these publicly held shores in the public/private beach zone,43 some states exclude the public from this zone.44 The issue remains vexed by uncertainty and controversy. ' At the root of the beach access issue are two competing values deeply entrenched in American legal traditions since the American Revolution: protections for private property and assertions of public trust interests in tidal and navigable waters.46 40. See, e.g., Glass v. Goeckel, 703 N.W.2d 58, 61 (Mich. 2005) (discussing a lawsuit for trespass that arose from a walk along a shoreline). 41. 132 S. Ct. 1215 (2012). 42.

Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1, 57 (1894) (stating that title and control of lands under tide waters “are vested in the sovereign for the benefit of the whole people”); Hardin v.

Beach access controversies are often brought by diametrically opposed advocates of these competing values, as exemplified by the Surfrider Foundation on the 304 South Carolina Law Review [VOL. 65:295 Accommodating even longstanding public and private property rights becomes inherently difficult when they overlap or collide on the beach.47 As shorelands shift because of natural processes and climate change, as population densities increase,49 and as more private developments spring up along ocean coasts and lakeshores,50 competition and conflicts over accessing the beach will become more frequent.3' It is perhaps because of this scarcity and competition that the public interest in beaches has become more pronounced.32 public trust side and the Pacific Legal Foundation on the private property side.

Borough o f Avon-by-the-Sea54 the New Jersey Supreme Court— cognizant of the scarcity of public beaches along the Atlantic Ocean—stated that the “demands upon them by reason of increased population, industrial development and their popularity for recreational uses and open space are much heavier, and their importance to the public welfare has become much more apparent.”55 In Marks v. Whitney,56 the California Supreme Court similarly addressed competing uses of the coast along the Pacific Ocean, declaring that “[t]his matter is of great public importance, particularly in view of population pressures, demands for recreational property, and the increasing development of seashore and waterfront property.”5 The concerns expressed by these justices over forty years ago are even more pressing today. As of 2003, over half of the U.S. population lived in coastal counties, and twenty-three of the twenty-five most densely populated U.S. counties were coastal.^ These are “some of the most developed areas in the nation.”59 Increased coastal population density has led to disputes regarding the boundary between public trust and private property in a variety of circumstances and jurisdictions.60 When the law is uncertain or vague, violations of legal rights can occur on either side: members of the public can trespass and diminish valuable private property rights,61 or private property owners can erect signs and fences or hire private security guards that unreasonably exclude the public from exercising rights to use beaches, thereby privatizing land that belongs to all.62 Krautkraemer, Economics o f Natural Resource Scarcity: The State o f the Debate 5 (Resources for the Future, Discussion Paper 05-14, 2005))). 53.

Only two of the eight Great Lakes states have published court decisions concerning the public’s right to walk on the public/private beach zone, with diametrically opposed results.64 This leaves most of the Great Lakes shoreline under a cloud of uncertainty regarding the expectations of private property owners and the public.65 For instance, in the Wisconsin case of Doemel v. Jantz,6b the court recognized an exclusive right of the private property owner to use the beach that prohibits beach walking above the water line.67 In contrast, Michigan’s Supreme Court in Glass v. Goeckef8 resolved the beach walking controversy in favor of the public’s right to walk along the shores of the Great Lakes in the public/private beach zone.69 To some, Glass v. Goeckel was an “expansion” of public use rights along the Great Lakes shoreline and a “redefinition” of the scope of public trust property.7\" To others, the decision was a predictable result of precedent, grounded in a public trust doctrine that has been a critical component of state sovereignty since the founding of the United States that is based on even earlier precedent from English and Roman law.71 With regard to ocean coastal areas, although public access to the public/private beach zone— and even the dry uplands— is well-established in many states, it is still in flux in others.

Before delving into the legal theories at work, however, it is important to understand the historical origins of the property at issue in the public/private beach zone, as well as the scope of the public trust doctrine. III. F o u n d a t i o n a l D o c t r i n e s : P u b l i c T r u s t a n d E q u a l F o o t i n g The public trust doctrine is the body of common, constitutional, and statutory law that generally provides that the state shall hold and manage tidal and navigable waters, along with the lands beneath them, in trust for the public.77 The property protected by the public trust doctrine, as well as the scope of the public rights that can be exercised on this property, are key issues that define the contours of public and private rights on beaches.78 Originally, courts interpreted public trust rights as the rights to use trust waters for navigation, commerce, and fishing.79 Some decisions include in these historical public rights the right of “passage and repassage,” interpreted today as the right to walk along the beach.80 73. See, e.g., Leydon v. Town of Greenwich, 111 A.2d 552, 557-58, 565-66 (Conn. 2001) (stating that the public may or may not have a right to use the beach property at issue and refusing to resolve the public trust issues); Fabrikant v.

In the early seventeenth century, during the establishment of the original American colonies, the public trust doctrine was an important principle of English common law.84 After the American Revolution, courts in the United States referred to English common law as the “direct ancestor of, and thus the presumptive authority and precedent for, application of the common law in the United States.”85 Thus, the public trust doctrine under English common law established the foundation of the American doctrine.86 As for the original scope of property held in trust under English common law, for all tidal waters, the “law recognized title in the crown up to the high- water mark . . . ,”87 According to the Supreme Court in Shively v. Bowlby,88 the King had “both the title and the dominion of the sea, and of rivers and arms of the sea, where the tide ebbs and flows, and of all the lands below high-water mark, within the jurisdiction of the Crown of England . . . ,”89 The King held the engage in other protected public rights of “fishing, hunting and navigation for commerce or pleasure”). 81.

According to one scholar: In cases like Martin v.

Keokuk,100 the Court explained the American departure from the English rule limiting Crown ownership to the beds under tidal waters.\"\" In the United States, settled law recognizes that the states obtained the lands under navigable freshwater lakes and rivers, as well as lands under tidal waters, when they entered into the Union— subject only to the federal navigation servitude and commerce power of Congress.102 The Court famously described this initial federal grant of navigable waters and the lands beneath them in Illinois Central R.R. Co. v. Illinois in 1892,103 and then again in Shively v. Bowlby in 1894.104 In Illinois Central, the Court ultimately upheld the Illinois legislature’s rescission of a grant to a railroad corporation of the bed of Lake Michigan in the Chicago Harbor because such a grant would be void under the public trust in the hands of the United States, so the national government was not competent to impair the trust and all states succeeded to the interest of the previous foreign sovereign.

The boundaries of the state were prescribed by congress and accepted by the state in its original Constitution. 107 Two years later, in Shively v. Bowlby, the United States Supreme Court built on the Illinois Central foundation and identified the boundary of the original grant from the federal government to the states as covering “soil below [the] high-water m ark . . . . ” 118 This demarcation line is consistent with English common law, under which the King’s trust holdings went up to the high-water mark on the shore. 101 Thus, when the federal government granted navigable and tidal waters to the states as they entered the Union, it did so up to the ordinary high-water mark. 110 105.

For oceans, the high-water mark may be called the mean high tide line, which is defined as “the average height of all the high waters” over the lunar cycle of 18.6 years that governs the tides. Borax Consol., Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296 U.S. 10, 26-27 (1935) (quoting Marmur, Tidal Datum Planes 76, Special Publication No. 135, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (1927)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This line can change significantly over the years. See id. For inland lakes, water levels fluctuate based on forces that lack the regularity of lunar tides, such as precipitation and barometric pressure: This fluctuation results in temporary exposure of land that may then remain exposed above where water currently lies. This land, although not immediately and presently submerged, falls within the ambit of the public trust because the lake has not permanently receded from that point and may yet again exert its influence up to that point. Glass v. Goeckel, 703 N.W.2d 58, 71 (Mich. 2005). The physical location of the ordinary high- water mark on lakes is often a discernible line landward of the point at which the water is in contact 312 S o u t h C a r o l in a L a w R e v ie w [Vol. 65:295 Since Shively v. Bowlby and Illinois Central, the United States Supreme Court has been relatively silent on the equal footing doctrine. However, the Court more recently reaffirmed in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Mississippi 11 in 1988 and PPL Montana, LLCU2 in 2012 that, under the equal footing doctrine, the federal government transferred ownership to the states over all lands subject to tidal influence, regardless of navigability, as well as all lands under rivers that were navigable in fact at the time of statehood.114 These decisions underscore the quality distinguishing the equal footing doctrine from the public trust doctrine.11' The equal footing doctrine, defined by federal law, describes the original grant of water-related property to the states as determined at the time of statehood; these waters are referred to as navigable for title purposes.116 Hence, the original demarcation line for trust lands and waters is the same for all states—consistent with the equal footing doctrine—and is set at the ordinary high-water mark pursuant to federal law.117 In contrast, the public trust doctrine, with the shore.

IV. Sovereignty Meta-Theory, Property, and Public Rights With regard to the question of locating the line where the coastal private fee title ends, states are divided. 123 Most states fall into the mean or ordinary high- water mark group124— consistent with the original federal grant of property to the states ' — while a minority fall into the mean or ordinary low-water mark group. 1-6 In this Article, these states will be referred to as “high-water” or “low- water states.” High-water states fix the boundary at the mean or ordinary high- water mark: private property in the uplands ends at the ordinary high-water 118.

Yet, even in the low-water states, the existence of private property to the low-water boundary alone does not determine the shared/exclusive nature of the property between the high- and low-water marks or the scope of public rights in that public/private beach zone.1”9 More surprising, perhaps, is that even in high- water states, there may be deeds that grant title to an individual private property owner down to the low-water mark or beyond.130 Thus, while all states have relatively clear rules regarding the dividing line between state and private title on the shore,1'' the particular legal theory undergirding their courts’ decisions is far more important in determining the contours of public and private rights,132 A fundamental difference between the beach access cases is whether courts view the dividing line for title purposes as the boundary for all public rights or whether courts recognize a public trust easement overlapping the private title.133 The meta-theory driving a court’s decision to use a lineal title or an easement approach focuses on whether the public trust doctrine is considered an attribute of state sovereignty.134 If so, the court will conclude that it is beyond the power of the state to redefine public trust property as private property and eliminate public rights.135 In other words, even if the state redrew the private property boundary at the low-water mark and was silent about the impact on public trust rights, a public trust easement must continue to exist up to the ordinary high- water mark because the state lacks the power to extinguish it. 1 16 Secondly, after determining whether the lineal title or the easement approach applies to the public/private beach property, the court will define the scope of public rights on the property.1 ’7 Whether a court views public rights as fixed or evolving influences the nature and category of rights protected in the public/private beach zone. 127.

Sovereignty Theory and Implications for the Choice o f Public Trust Easement or Lineal Title The extent to which the public trust doctrine protects public uses of the beach up to the ordinary high-water mark depends on whether courts are persuaded by an overarching sovereignty meta-theory: the public trust doctrine is an attribute of state sovereignty, and as such, the state lacks the power to eliminate it.13S According to this theory, it is “beyond the power of the state” to completely abdicate trust responsibility over lands and waters the federal government originally transferred at statehood to be held in trust. 139 Given the strong protections for exclusive use of private property in the United States, Professor Carol Rose highlighted this anomalous approach to public trust property, stating that “[m]ost property is not impressed with a ‘public trust’ allowing access; why should the beaches be? ” 140 Drawing on the definitional-historical approach to understanding property taken by the Supreme Court in Phillips Petroleum and Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 141 courts motivated by a sovereignty theory view public access as inherent in the title to the public/private beach zone, even when the terms of the deed are silent about the existence of an easement. 142 In takings terms—as will be discussed below—this forms the foundation of background principles necessary to understanding property rights. 143 Some courts have concluded that states cannot 138.

Under Roman law, this was not an open question because the great waters and the lands below the highest tide were not only publicly owned, but they were considered in the class of things incapable of private ownership. 149 England continued to use a similar property construction, but it substituted the King as the steward of resources for the Roman concept of the laws of nature. 1511 However, unlike Roman natural law, vesting title in the Crown did not mean that the foreshore area was incapable of private ownership; rather, it meant that private title was severed from and needed to coexist along with public rights. 151 The English common law concepts of jus privatum and jus publicum encapsulate the inalienable public easement with overlapping public and private rights. 152 Jus privatum is the legal title to the land that the Crown may transfer to a private owner. 155 Jus publicum, however, is the sovereign’s duty to hold property in trust for the public benefit. 154 Out of these English common law descriptions, a sovereignty theory developed that led to the conclusion that the King could not convey the public trust easement or jus publicum'55: “Although 144.

The jus publicum included uses ‘for highways of navigation and commerce, domestic and foreign, and for the purpose of fishing by all the King’s subjects. ’” 156 Under English common law, the dividing line for private title was not the same as the line for public rights. 157 Put another way, the holder of the jus privatum (title) in the public/private beach zone could not “impede the public’s customary use of public trust land . . . ,” 1:>8 During the early development of the public trust doctrine in the United States, this sovereignty theory permeated some of the landmark Supreme Court cases.1' For instance, in Pollard v. Hagan, ' 60 the Supreme Court described the “right to the shore between high and low water-mark” as “an attribute of sovereignty.” 161 The Court declared that “[r]ivers must be kept open; they are not land, which may be sold, and the right to them passes with a transfer of sovereignty [from the United States to the states] . ” 162 Similarly, in Illinois Central, the Court explained that ownership of the navigable waters and lakebeds is a “subject of public concern to the whole people of the State.” 163 The Court also reasoned that “[t]he sovereign power, itself, therefore, cannot. . . make a direct and absolute grant of the waters of the State, divesting all the citizens of their common right.” 164 Thus, according to a sovereignty theory, if after being admitted into the Union, a state chooses to transfer to private owners the title to the public/private beach zone between the ordinary high- and low-water marks, those lands are still burdened with a public 156. Opinion of the Justices, 649 A.2d 604, 607-08 (N.H. 1994) (citing Shively, 152 U.S. at 11,13). According to Kilbert: Both private, jus privatum, and public, jus publicum, interests were recognized in the lands underlying navigable waters. While legal title to the lands under navigable waters (jus privatum) could be transferred by the crown to a private party, the crown would continue to hold the public's interest in using the lands (jus publicum) in trust for the people.

Such an approach does not outright prohibit all private ownership in this area, but it does maintain public rights if the property’s title is conveyed into private ownership. The Supreme Court limited the situations in which a state may make valid grants of trust property to when parcels “are used in promoting the interests of the public” or “can be disposed of without any substantial impairment of the public interest in the lands and waters 172remaining.” According to Professor Robert Abrams, the holding in Illinois Central “clearly announced the burden on states: the foreshore was trust property, not only while it was in the hands of the federal government in the pre-statehood 165. See id. States may alienate trust lands below the ordinary high-water mark, but such grants cannot interfere with the superior rights of public use and navigation. See Shively v.

In Shively, the Court did not need to address whether a state must maintain public rights on trust lands conveyed or granted to private owners because the Oregon law that allowed for the sale of tidelands down to the low-water mark expressly stated that the grant was subject to the public easement.

Whitney179 typifies a sovereignty theory and easement construct. 180 In that case, the court rejected an attempt by a landowner to fill tidelands, based on an understanding that the beach property was a divided estate on which the private title was burdened by public rights that “restrained private development. . . .” 181 Marks v. Whitney is an excellent example of how an easement approach allows a court to simultaneously recognize the state’s sovereign ownership of tidelands up to the mean high-tide line and not disturb individual patents that grant private ownership in land to the mean low-tide line. ' 82 Accounting for the sale of tidelands to private owners, the court asserted that the “only practicable theory” was to recognize that the sale of these lands did not divest the public of their rights. ’ In this way, an easement approach accommodates multiple interests 173.

See id. at 380 (quoting City of Long Beach v. Mansell, 476 P.2d 423, 437 (Cal. 1970)). For instance, the court opined that the legislature could convey tidelands into private absolute ownership freed of the public trust if the legislature finds the lands were “no longer useful for trust purposes” and “not subject to the constitutional prohibition forbidding S o u t h C a r o l in a L a w R e v ie w320 [V o l . 65: 295 and harmonizes otherwise discordant laws. 184 Drawing upon English common law, the California Supreme Court restated: Our opinion is that the buyer of land under these statutes receives the title to the soil, the jus privatum, subject to the public right of navigation, and in subordination to the right of the state to take possession and use and improve it for that purpose, as it may deem necessary. In this way the public right will be preserved, and the private right of the purchaser will be given as full effect as the public interests will permit. 1 5 Another example of a state court employing the sovereignty theory comes from Wisconsin. 18 When Wisconsin entered the Union on equal footing with the original states and obtained title to all navigable waters, as well as the lands beneath them, it incorporated the language of the Northwest Ordinance into the state constitution as follows187: “[T]he navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between the same, shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the state, as to the citizens of the United States, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor.” Following Illinois Central and Shively, 189 the Wisconsin Supreme Court interpreted this provision to form the foundation of the public trust doctrine, which it applied to the original federal grant of trust property to the state. 190 The court also articulated this doctrine as a limitation on state sovereignty: the state holds title to navigable waters and the lands beneath them “solely fo r. . . trust purposes, and . . . any conveyance in violation of such trust is necessarily alienation . .. .” Id. (quoting Mansell, 476 P.2d at 437). The court described such a decision as a “political question” for the legislature. Id. at 381. 184. See id. at 379 (quoting Cal. Fish Co., 138 P. at 87). 185. Id.

Goeckel, 703 N.W.2d 58, 65 (Mich. 2005).

Husting,19- illustrates how a sovereignty theory allows courts to reconcile the concept of maintaining the public trust doctrine with a state’s power to define property rights. 193 In Diana Shooting Club, the court explained that although Wisconsin decided to divest its ownership of the beds of navigable rivers and allow private ownership, public rights must limit that private title. 194 According to the court, “As long as the state secures to the people all the rights they would be entitled to if it owned the beds of navigable rivers, it fulfills the trust imposed upon it by the organic law, which declares that all navigable waters shall be forever free.” 195 With regard to public trust rights, the court stated that “it is entirely immaterial who holds the title, the state or the riparian owners. . . . It is beyond the power of the state to alienate [beds underlying navigable waters] freed from such rights.” ' 96 Thus, the Diana Shooting Club court viewed public trust rights as a kind of easement that burdened the private estate and could never be eliminated. 197 This easement prevented the state from conveying the typical ownership right to exclude, along with the private title to the riverbed. 198 Ultimately, the court rejected the trespassing claim before it and held that the public maintained a public trust right to hunt on the riverbed up to the ordinary high-water mark—despite the private ownership of the riverbed. 99 Moreover, the coexistence of public and private rights on the same property accommodates the various rights at issue in contemporary beach access controversies. 10 A court can recognize overlapping rights in this area: the 192. 145 N.W. 816 (Wis. 1914). 193.

' 04 Nonetheless, a public trust easement continues to protect public rights to the high-water mark.205 Thus, the public trust easement on the private fees protects public usufructuary rights just like riparian or littoral rights extend private rights into public waters.206 Under an easement approach, private property holders have more limited rights to exclude the public from exercising public trust uses on the property. ' 07 In contrast to the sovereignty theory that leads to an easement approach, ' 08 a competing theory is that the state has ultimate control to define (i.e., shrink) the scope of trust property, subject only to the Federal Government’s constitutional right to control commerce and navigation. ' 110 Support for that theory is found in the fact that some states have conveyed trust property to private owners effectively free of public rights.210 201.

Our decision today does nothing to change ownership rights in States which previously relinquished a public trust claim to tidelands such as those at issue here.” 215 The Court went on to state that, “even where States have given dominion over tidelands to private property owners, some States have retained for the general public the right to fish, hunt, or bathe on these lands.” 216 The Supreme Court’s discussion in Phillips Petroleum indicates that states may, but not necessarily must, retain a public trust easement on those trust lands.217 Professor Kenneth Kilbert offered a finer point on the debate.218 He described the original federal grant as only the “starting point” for the demarcation line between public and private, suggesting that states are able to change the boundaries of private title to extend below the high-water mark within certain limited circumstances.219 He argued—consistently with Shively and Phillips Petroleum—that the states “have some authority to redefine the geographic scope of the lands held in public trust,” but that authority is neither boundless nor ossified in the original purposes of the public trust doctrine.220 He asserted—consistently with Illinois Central—that a state can only contract the 211.

However, the Shively decision did not involve the issue of whether a state can extinguish the public trust easement when it conveys trust lands into private ownership. 324 S o u t h C a r o l in a L a w R e v ie w [Vol. 65: 295 scope of lands protected by the public trust doctrine when (1) “the legislature’s intent to do so is clear,” (2) “the public’s rights to engage in uses protected by the public trust doctrine are not substantially impaired,” and (3) “where an important public interest is promoted.”221 Courts that reject a sovereignty theory in favor of a more absolute state power to define property rights tend to focus on a lineal title interpretation of the property boundaries.222 Under a lineal title approach, the dividing line for title purposes is exactly the same as the dividing line for public rights.2\"’ Courts adopting this approach view the public trust doctrine as rooted in ownership and divide coastal property into public and private fee simples.224 Thus, under the lineal title approach, no public rights exist on the private property side of the line.225 Courts that follow a lineal title approach draw a bright line between private and public property—both for title and for use rights.'\"6 However, this approach is a double-edged sword that can also limit private rights.2' 7 For instance, the New Jersey Supreme Court followed a lineal title approach in Arnold v. Mundy, denying private rights to harvest oysters.22S According to Professor Michael Blumm, that approach led the court to conclude: The beds of waters influenced by the tides or that are navigable-in-fact were state-owned in trust for the public, while lands submerged beneath non tidal, non-navigable waters could be privately owned. Sovereign lands and private lands existed side-by-side, with the lands critically important for navigation and fishing in public hands.\"4 B.

Town o f Wells (Bell I l f ' exemplifies a fixed theory of common law public rights.236 In that case, the court explained that public rights in Maine historically included “fishing, fowling, and navigation (whether for recreation or business) and any other uses reasonably incidental or related” to those rights.237 The court saw these public rights as “long-established property rights” in the form of an easement on private fees that the state could not simply alter to accommodate new public needs.238 To do so, according to the court in Bell II, may run afoul of “constitutional prohibitions on the taking of private property without compensation.” 239 Referring to the public rights of fishing, fowling, and navigation as “the ancient easement,” the court rejected the assertion that adding rights for bathing, sunbathing, and recreational walking would be “no more burdensome” on the private landowner.240 The rationale that undergirds this fixed theory of public uses is that it reasonably anchors public rights and does not burden private property by requiring accommodations for “new recreational needs.”24' Proponents of the theory critique the evolving public rights theory on the grounds that such an open-ended interpretation of public uses would make private property rights on 230.

Whitney exemplifies an evolving theory of common law public rights. In that case, the court determined whether the respondent could fill and develop tidelands to which he had title when such actions would cut off his neighbor’s access to the ocean.25’ The California Supreme Court described public rights as “sufficiently flexible to encompass changing public needs” and held that the court was “not burdened with an outmoded classification” of rights.\" 54 The court included as protected public trust rights— based on “a growing public recognition” of its importance—“the preservation of those [tide]lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area.” ' 55 Thus, the court applied an evolving theory of public rights, along with an easement approach based on a sovereignty theory, and held that Marks did not have the right to fill and develop the tidelands to which he held title. ' 56 The court reasoned that Marks’ jus privatum was subject to public rights to protect the area as an open natural space.257 Similarly, as explained further in Part V, courts in New Jersey, New Hampshire, Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have explicitly adopted an evolving theory of public trust rights.258 V. Beach Access Cases A majority of states maintains the division of title between private owners and the state at the mean or ordinary high-water mark—consistent with the nature of the property the federal government transferred to the states when they entered the Union.259 In these high-water states, beach walking is usually allowed in the public/private beach zone.260 Even in high-water states, however, 252. See Marks v. Whitney, 491 P.2d 374, 380-81 (Cal. 1971) (denying tideland development and recognizing ecological protections that would limit public access to land to which the owner had title in a high-water state, and recognizing ecological protection as a public trust use); McGarvey, 28 A.3d at 636 (allowing access for scuba diving in a low-water state). 253.

See, e.g., West v. Slick, 326 S.E.2d 601, 618 (N.C. 1985) (finding that “passage by the public by foot, vehicle and boat must be free and substantially unobstructed over the entire width of the foreshore”). North Carolina is an example of a state in which the right of public access to 328 S o u t h C a r o l in a L a w R e v ie w [VOL. 65: 295 boundary issues arise when individual deeds purport to grant title to land within or below the public/private beach zone.261 In those cases, the court’s theory of coastal property rights influences how the court interprets the deeds. Recall that the California Supreme Court applied a sovereignty theory in Marks v. Whitney, concluding that an easement existed in the public/private beach zone—thus beaches for walking, as well as all forms of recreation, has long been recognized and protected. See N.C. G e n . STAT. § 1-45.1 (2011) (declaring that “public trust rights .. . include, but are not limited to, the right to navigate, swim, hunt, fish, and enjoy all recreational activities in the watercourses of the State and the right to freely use and enjoy the State's ocean and estuarine beaches and public access to the beaches.”); Fabrikant v. Currituck Cnty., 621 S.E.2d 19, 27 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005) (citing Friends of Hatteras Island Nat’l Historic Mar. Forest Land Trust for Pres., Inc. v. Coastal Res. Comrn’n of N.C., 452 S.E.2d 337, 348 (N.C. Ct. App. 1995)). The dividing line of ownership is the mean high-tide line on the North Carolina coast. N.C. G e n . Stat. § 77-20 (2011); West, 326 S.E.2d at 617-18 (quoting Carolina Beach Fishing Pier, Inc. v. Town of Carolina Beach, 177 S.E.2d 513, 516 (N.C. 1970)). In West v. Slick, the North Carolina Supreme Court referred to this demarcation line as reflecting a “long established rule that littoral rights do not include ownership of the foreshore.” West, 326 S.E.2d at 617. West did not directly address beach walking, but revolved around a dispute regarding property owners’ ability to establish a neighborhood public road, or public road by prescription or dedication, across neighboring land. Id. at 602 (citing N.C. G e n . STAT. § 136-67 (2011)). After drawing this boundary line in the sand—and without reference to English common law—the court nonetheless acknowledged the existence of overlapping rights in the public/private beach zone. See id. For instance, although the beach below the mean high-tide line is public property, a littoral owner has the right to place a pier in this area. Id. These littoral rights are like a private easement on public land. Id. at 618. However, the owner must ensure that “passage under the pier must be free and substantially unobstructed over the entire width” of the public/private beach zone. Id. at 617 (quoting Carolina Beach Fishing Pier, 177 S.E.2d at 516). This means that from mean low to high tide, the pier must be at such a height that “the public will have no difficulty in walking under it when the tide is low or in going under it in boats when the tide is high. ... ” Id. (quoting Carolina Beach Fishing Pier, 177 S.E.2d at 516). Without explanation or references, the court simply declared that “[t]he long standing right of the public to pass over and along the strip of land lying between the high-water mark and the low-water mark adjacent to respondents' property is well established beyond need of citation.” Id. Then, the court affirmed “once again” the rule that “passage by the public by foot, vehicle and boat must be free and substantially unobstructed over the entire width of the foreshore . . . .” Id. at 618. Interestingly, there are very few piers along North Carolina’s ocean coast, and North Carolina’s “Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) regulations implicitly prohibit” the construction of private ocean piers.

Stat. § 77-20(d)-(e); West, 326 S.E.2d at 601. When faced with a constitutional challenge to this provision, the North Carolina Court of Appeals did not reach the merits: the litigants voluntarily dismissed the claim based on the state’s position that the provision did not create a public easement over the dry sand area of the beach. Fabrikant, 621 S.E.2d at 24, 31. However, Professor Joseph Kalo asserted that, in North Carolina, the public has a common law customary right to use dry sand oceanfront beaches, regardless of title.

A state’s recognition of private title to the low-water mark does not automatically extinguish all public rights in the public/private beach zone.263 Beach access in the United States varies not only between states,264 but also within the same state.\"65 As noted, the property and common law theories applied by a court, as well as the extent to which a court relies on English common law, influence the outcome for public beach access.266 This is most readily observed when comparing decisions from states that share common legal foundations. Parts V.A and V.B demonstrate this point by analyzing cases from the former Massachusetts Bay Colony and from the former Northwest Territory around the Great Lakes. A. The Former Massachusetts Bay Colony: Maine and Massachusetts The beach access cases from Maine and Massachusetts present a rich comparative body of state law because their intertidal property law is built upon a shared legal foundation: the Massachusetts Bay Colony’s Colonial Ordinance of 1641-47.\" Under the Colonial Ordinance, private property ownership extended from the uplands to the low-tide mark.263 The Ordinance modified 262.

However, the supreme courts in Maine and Massachusetts have followed different legal theories, producing divergent results.\"7\" In McGarvey v. Whittredge, the Maine Supreme Court took a sovereignty approach and found a public trust easement, coupled with an evolving common law public rights theory,27j and recognized public access for scuba diving.274 However, the Maine Supreme Court and Massachusetts Supreme Court previously applied the lineal title approach and fixed common law public rights theory—in the Maine case of Bell v.

Whittredge?1'1 The court traced the legal development of private ownership and public rights in this zone back to its origins in English common law and the easement approach that overlaps jus privatum and jus publicum.280 After recounting the transfer of property under the equal footing doctrine, the court explained that Maine modified its common law to allow private ownership to the low-water mark; however, similar to English common law, this property is “subject to the public trust rights reserved to the State.”281 The court sought a legal interpretation that balanced what it 269.

Silver Beach Imp. A ss’n, Inc.300 than in Maine’s McGarvey decision.2'11 The coastal property in question in Michaelson contained a sea wall at the low-water mark. Applying a lineal title theory, the court determined that the state’s property began where private property ended at the seawall and extended into the ocean. 3 The Massachusetts Supreme Court decided Michaelson in 1961— eleven years after the State of Massachusetts added sand below this sea wall and built a beach that the Silver Beach Improvement Association’s members and others used for “usual beach purposes, such as sun-bathing, bathing, and picnicking.”304 Despite the state investment in building the beach and its public use for over a decade, the Massachusetts Supreme Court enjoined the beach association from continuing to use the area for beach activities and held that the littoral owners became the owners of the new beach down to the new low-water mark.305 The Michaelson court was silent on English common law and the concept of a jus publicum easement burdening the private estate.306 Instead, the court relied exclusively on state law, likening the state action of adding sand to build out the beach to natural accretion: just as under the law of accretion, the littoral owners obtained title to the new beach area down to the new low-water mark.307 This is an unusual analysis for a beach renourishment project paid for by the state; such projects are typically defined as avulsion, instead of accretion, placing the newly created property in the state’s domain.308 299.

Unlike an accretion, which is a gradual buildup of land, an avulsion is a sudden buildup of land, which does not entitle 334 S o u t h C a r o l in a L a w R e v ie w [VOL. 65:295 Also motivating the decision was the court’s view of public rights as fixed in the seventeenth century: according to the court, the only specific powers of the state to alter the shoreline “without compensation to private parties are those to regulate and improve navigation and the fisheries.”30 The state has “no power to build beaches for bathing purposes without compensating the littoral owners . . . 10 This is a particularly striking opinion, given that the state added sand to property clearly in the public domain below the low-tide line.3\" The Michaelson decision highlights the power of a fixed theory of common law public rights to favor private property owners’ exclusive use of the shore, even in the face of facts that would seem to indicate a different result. Similarly, in an advisory opinion, the Massachusetts Supreme Court considered whether a proposed bill creating an “on-foot right-of-passage” in the intertidal zone was permissible. The Opinion o f the Justices case turned on a fixed theory of common law public rights— solidified in the terms of the Colonial Ordinance—that allowed the public to use the public/private beach zone for fishing and navigation.314 The court noted that it was “unable to find any authority that the rights of the public include a right to walk on the beach.”313 The court indicated that, in other states—where the property boundary between public and private is drawn at the high-water mark—public rights in the beach are broader.316 However, where private property runs to the low-water mark and beach walking is not seen as fitting within seventeenth the littoral property owner to a change in the property boundary.

Additionally, many beach renourishment projects now involve federal funding and the Army Corps of Engineers, requiring public access easements for all nourished beaches. See, e.g., Chiesa v. D. Lobi Enter., No. C-296-06, 2012 WL 4464382, at *1 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. Sept. 28, 2012) (involving circumstances in which the Army Corp of Engineers required a state to certify prior to construction of a beach replenishment project that it obtained permanent public access easements for all nourished beaches). 309.

The Former Northwest Territory Around the Great Lakes: Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Minnesota Like the shared historical origins of Maine and Massachusetts in the Massachusetts Bay Colony’s Colonial Ordinance of 1641-47,321 the Great Lakes states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Minnesota have mutual origins in the Northwest Territory. ’2\" For areas that were part of the Northwest Territory before statehood, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 is generally considered part 317. See id. at 568. The Supreme Court of Maine similarly held that Maine’s Public Trust in intertidal Land Act, which created a comprehensive recreational easement and recognized public rights beyond the traditional scope of the Colonial Ordinance, was an unconstitutional taking without compensation. See Bell v. Town of Wells (Bell II), 557 A.2d 168, 179 (Me. 1989). The court grounded its decision in the terms of the Colonial Ordinance and interpreted public rights as an easement limited to fishing, fowling, and navigation. See id. at 174. Further, in Groves v. Secretary, Department o f Natural Resources & Environmental Control, a Delaware court mirrored the Massachusetts Supreme Court’s analysis while applying a state law that recognizes private littoral title to the low-water mark. See C.A. No. 92A-10-003, 1994 WL 89804, at *5-6 (Del. Super. Ct. Feb. 8, 1994) (citations omitted). The Groves court stated that the public trust rights in states in which littoral owners’ title stops at the high-water mark were “of no value at all” to decide the case. See id. at *5. While private property owners in Delaware need to accommodate the “superior” public rights to navigate and fish in the foreshore, these rights do not include “access to the foreshore for walking and/or recreational activities.” See id. at *6. Thus, the court opined that, if a court or legislature grants such a public right, “the State will have to compensate the affected landowners for a takings [sic].” Id. The court’s decision, while recognizing some limited overlapping rights in the foreshore, did not refer to English common law and the rights included in the jus publicum in this public/private beach zone. See id. at *5-6 (citations omitted). It also ascribed to a fixed theory of the common law—one that recognizes public rights related only to navigation and fishing. See id. at *6 (citing Bickel v.

Specifically, the Northwest Ordinance declared navigable waters and “the carrying places” between them as “common highways” that were to be “forever free” for all inhabitants of the territory.3\"4 Despite their common legal foundation in the Northwest Ordinance, the Great Lakes states vary considerably in their approaches to private property ownership and public access along their navigable waters.3' 1' Similar to case law in Maine, Wisconsin’s decisions are inconsistent with regard to theory, law, and results.326 Michigan and Minnesota clearly find a public trust easement in the public/private beach zone.3' 7 And Ohio provides a distinct outlier example of a lineal title approach at work.32* Michigan’s Glass v. Goeckel is the first—and still the only—case among the Great Lakes states to directly decide whether the public has a right to walk the shores of any of the Great Lakes.3’\" With 3,288 miles331 of Great Lakes coastline, Michigan has more coastline than any other state, with the exception of Alaska;3’2 accordingly, the decision has had an extensive impact within Michigan’s borders, and it provides a modem and historically grounded template for other states wrestling with beach access disputes.

Id. 2013] Public Access and Private Property Along the Coast 337 c o a s t l i n e . An easement approach based on a sovereignty theory infused this decision; however, rather than relying on an evolving common law theory, the court grounded beach walking rights in the traditional public trust rights of “passage.” 334 The dispute in Glass v. Goeckel arose when a Iakefront property owner brought a trespass claim against a neighbor for walking along the public/private beach zone. 35 In that case, the private landowner along Lake Huron held “title to the water’s edge.” 336 Given that this deed expressed title below the ordinary high-water mark, the issue before the court was “how the public trust affects that title.”' ' The Michigan Supreme Court drew the line between public and private property along the Great Lakes at the ordinary high-water mark, explaining that all land below that mark was held in trust for the public. ’38 However, the court acknowledged that some lakeshore property deeds—such as the one before it— described private property boundaries below this mark.339 Like the deeds involved in the California case of Marks v. Whitney,340 or the Ohio case of State ex rel. Merrill v. Ohio D ep’t o f Natural Resources, deeds in Michigan may set the private property boundary at the low-water mark, or water’s edge, which is somewhere below the ordinary high-water mark.341 However, unlike the Ohio Supreme Court, Michigan rejected the lineal title approach that “private title necessarily ends where public rights begin.” 342 Given the existence of these variable terms in deeds, the court needed a legal theory that reconciled private title descriptions that were seemingly at odds with state ownership of navigable waters up to the ordinary high-water mark.343 The 333.

Compare Glass, 703 N.W.2d at 70 (holding that the “boundary of the public trust need not equate with the boundary of a landowner's littoral title”), with Merrill, 955 N.E.2d at 948 (determining that the “natural shoreline” delineates the boundary between public and private property). 343. If the issue of validity of private ownership lakeward of the ordinary high-water mark had been raised in Wisconsin, the court’s reasoning may have been different because of Wisconsin’s clear prohibition against any conveyance of lakebed for purely private purposes. See Priewe v. Wis. State Land & Improvement Co., 67 N.W. 918, 922 (Wis. 1896). Although Wisconsin’s legislature has made grants of public trust property, that property may only be used for public purposes, and such grants do not operate to transfer the legal title from the state. City of Madison v. State, 83 N.W.2d 674, 678 (Wis. 1957). Further, the rights vested in grantees of trust property are extremely limited: the state merely gives the grantee the ability to use the property—a privilege that is revocable at any time. See id. For instance, the legislature gave the City of Madison permission to 338 South Carolina Law Review [VOL. 65: 295 court in Glass v. Goeckel applied a sovereignty theory that led to the finding of a public trust easement,344 while also distinguishing private title from public rights.343 Similar to the California Supreme Court in Marks v. Whitney, 46 the Michigan Supreme Court reasoned that, although the state may “convey lakefront property to private parties, it necessarily conveys such property subject to the public trust.” 34 Similar to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in R.W. Docks & Slips v. Wisconsin, the Michigan Supreme Court highlighted that, on navigable waters, public rights limit private title—a concept that is “vital” to public trust law.34'3 The Michigan Supreme Court based its holding on a view of the public trust doctrine as a limitation on state sovereignty: in other words, because the state cannot abdicate its trustee responsibilities to protect public rights in the Great Lakes and its beaches up to the ordinary high-water mark— even if the state had issued patents to private parties that extended below the high-water mark— it could not have conveyed away the public trust easement.344 The court declared that “the sovereign must preserve and protect navigable waters for its people.” 330 Thus, the Michigan Supreme Court reconciled potential conflicts between private title and public rights by recognizing an easement that accommodates the coexistence of private title and public rights.351 Drawing on historic English common law concepts of jus privatum and jus publicum, the court dissolved the potential dissonance/3' To the court, whether private property extends to the high- or low-water mark is irrelevant to the question of public rights: “Because the public trust doctrine preserves public rights separate from a landowner’s fee use trust property to build a civic center on Lake Monona, while continuing to vest ownership and trust responsibilities in the state. See id. at 675, 678. Continued use of that trust property, however, does not give Madison title to the property. See id. at 678. A lakebed grant in Wisconsin is conceptually like the state granting a private easement on public lands. 344. See Glass, 703 N.W.2d at 65, 74, 75. 345. Id. at 70. 346. 491 P.2d 374 (1971). 347.

Goeckel court concluded that “private title of littoral landowners remains subject to the public trust beneath the ordinary high-water mark.” 355 In so doing, the court noted that recognizing what is essentially a public trust easement is not “novel” because other states—such as Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, and California—“have similarly accommodated the same practical challenge of fixing boundaries on shifting waters: they acknowledged the possibility of public rights coextensive with private title.” 356 Based on its finding of an inalienable public trust easement, the Michigan Supreme Court rejected the court of appeals’ lineal title approach to coastal rights, which—just like Wisconsin’s 1923 decision in Doemel v. Jantz 57— granted the private property owner exclusive use of the beach.358 The Michigan Supreme Court described the grant of exclusive use in the private title holder as an erroneous decision that “upset the balance between private title and public rights along our Great Takes and disrupted a previously quiet status quo.” 356 Additionally, Glass v. Goeckel provides a window into the Michigan Supreme Court’s view of the takings provision and whether littoral rights include the right to exclude the public from the public/private beach zone.366 Although the court considered littoral rights to be property, the court also noted that these rights are subject to the “paramount” public trust, the exercise or protection of which does not require the state to pay compensation to the landowner.361 The court expounded that “[b]ecause private littoral title remains subject to the public trust, no taking occurs when the state protects and retains that which it could not 353.

Docks regarding the limitations of riparian rights that overlap with public rights in the water.363 Thus, Glass v. Goeckel and R. W. Docks stand for the proposition that a private property owner’s takings claim related to activity in the public/private beach zone, or the water beyond, is very weak in states that subscribe to a sovereignty theory and find an inalienable public trust easement—a state cannot take what it already holds in trust.364 After determining that regardless of who holds title in the public/private beach zone, a public trust easement will always exist, the Glass v. Goeckel court explained that “walking along the lakeshore is inherent in the exercise of traditionally protected public rights of fishing, hunting, and navigation . . . ,”365 Pursuant to Article IV of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787—the “forever free” provision— the court said it “must protect the Great Lakes as ‘common highways.’”366 Hence, Michigan’s “public trust doctrine permits pedestrian use of [the] Great Lakes, up to and including the land below the ordinary high-water mark.” 67 The court described this public trust right as a “common sense assumption,” noting agreement among the litigants that walking along the shore falls within traditionally protected public trust rights.368 A “right of passage over land below the ordinary high-water mark” is necessary to engage in other protected public rights of “fishing, hunting, and navigation for commerce or pleasure.”36 The court noted that other states, such as New Jersey and Connecticut, have also 370 recognized a right of passing and repassing as part of the public use of waters. The court reasoned that “gaining access to the Great Lakes to hunt, fish, or boat required walking to reach the water. Consequently, the public has always held a right of passage in and along the lakes.”371 Similar to the Maine Supreme Court’s McGarvey decision, the Glass v. Goeckel decision focused on the traditional rights of passage and repassage contained within the public trust easement.37\" However, while the Maine 362. Id. at 78. 363. See id.; R.W.

Goeckel private property owner, these lakefront property owners claimed their deeds showed that their boundaries extended farther into the lake than this mark.380 In 2011, the Ohio Supreme Court determined in State ex rel.

Compare McGarvey, 28 A.3d at 638-39 (expanding the public trust doctrine to include walking along the beach), with Glass, 703 N.W.2d at 62 (noting that, to use the beach for the traditionally protected rights under the public trust doctrine, one necessarily needed to walk along the shore). 374.

The Ohio Court of Appeals’ opinion in Merrill discussed beach walking, see id. (providing that the public has a right to walk the shore but only lakeward of the water’s edge), while the Ohio Supreme Court ultimately held that the public had no public trust right to use the shore above the natural shoreline.

Goeckel, or the Wisconsin Supreme Court in Diana Shooting Club, does not view the public trust doctrine as inherent in state sovereignty.383 The opinion lacks any justification or rationale for its variance from maintaining public ownership of lands that the federal government transferred to Ohio when it entered the Union. Instead, the court simply used a lineal title lens and applied a kind of quid pro quo reasoning that, “if a littoral owner has no property rights lakeward of the natural shoreline, then the territory of the public trust does not extend landward beyond the natural shoreline.” 385 The Ohio Supreme Court defined the title boundary as the same boundary for public rights; thus, the decision would likely preclude beach walking above the “natural shoreline.” 386 Minnesota has similarly drawn the private property boundary below the ordinary high-water mark: private property runs to the low-water mark in Minnesota.38 However, unlike the Merrill court’s decision in Ohio, the Minnesota Supreme Court recognizes a public trust easement in the public/private beach zone. State v. Korrer did not involve beach walking, but rather, it involved the rights of a riparian to mine ore in the public/private beach zone.390 Its relevance here, however, is to illustrate another application of a public trust easement, coupled with an evolving public rights theory, in a state that draws the riparian property boundary at the low-water mark. 381. See Merrill, 955 N.E.2d at 949. The court defined the natural shoreline as “the line at which the water usually stands when free from disturbing causes.” Id. Although this demarcation line is somewhat vague, it is probably somewhere below the ordinary high-water mark.

Id. at 618. 2013] Public Access and Private Property Along the Coast 343 The Minnesota Supreme Court described Minnesota’s property law as informed by English common law,391 but also clearly declared that each state is free to determine property rights suitable to each state’s conditions392: “It is now well settled . . . that this is not a federal question, but that each state must determine for itself the question of the ownership of the soil underlying its public waters.” 393 The court analyzed English common law to assist in shaping Minnesota’s property rules related to lakefront properties.394 However, the court could find no judicial decisions “clearly defining rights in fresh water lakes or rivers prior to the separation of the colonies from England.” 395 After concluding that no uniformity existed among the states on these property rules, the court determined that, in Minnesota, “the title of the proprietor of lands abutting upon navigable waters extends to [the] low-water mark.” Nonetheless, the court recognized an easement in the public/private beach zone. Although the riparian enjoys “proprietary privileges” in this zone, the state retains a superior right: “The state may use [the public/private beach zone] for any. . . public purpose, and to that end may reclaim it during periods of low water, and protect it from any use, even by the riparian owner, that would interfere with its present or prospective public use, without compensation.” 398 In Minnesota, private title is “limited or qualified by the right of the public to use the same for purpose of navigation or other public purpose,” 399 The addition of the term “other public purpose” is consistent with an evolving theory of public rights. The Minnesota Supreme Court viewed the law as evolving to encompass waters valuable to the public for multiple purposes beyond one of the original public trust purposes of commercial navigation.400 For example, in rejecting a commercial navigation test for whether the state held a water body in 391.

Jantz4lb still stands as Wisconsin’s singular published court decision on the right of the public to walk along lakeshores, and it exemplifies how the application of a lineal title approach and a fixed theory of the common law favors exclusive private use of the shore.400 Doemel v. Jantz arose when a riparian landowner brought a claim for trespass against a beach walker who traveled along the public/private beach zone, adjacent to the landowner’s property along Lake Winnebago.407 The Wisconsin Supreme Court began its analysis by emphasizing the benefits of riparian ownership and underscoring the importance of the private property right to exclude.40* The court then identified seemingly conflicting decisions: some in 401.

Bilot,409 and others in which the private landowner held title to the low-water mark, such as Mariner v. Schulte.41° While these cases could have been harmonized by applying a sovereignty theory that recognizes an inalienable public trust easement—as the court had previously done in Diana Shooting Club4U—the Doemel court viewed the law through a lineal title property lens.412 When a court applying a lineal title lens is faced with a case holding that the state boundary extends to the high-water mark and another case holding that the private property extends to the low-water mark, one case must be minimized, ignored, or otherwise distinguished. Doemel distinguished the Bilot precedent— that the state holds title to the ordinary high-water mark—by taking the extraordinary step of adding a new legal requirement that water must be present up to the high-water mark for the public to assert any protected public trust rights.413 Ultimately, the Doemel court erroneously concluded that “[t]his court. . . has firmly declared that the title of a riparian owner on a navigable inland meandered lake extends to [the] low-water mark.” 414 The court gave the drawing of this private title line to the low-water mark considerable weight in the outcome of the decision, explaining that “[i]f the rights of riparian owners had not attached or been declared by the courts [to go to the low-water mark], a different situation would be presented.” 415 Based on a lineal title approach, when the court drew the private property boundary at the low-water mark, the court asserted that a riparian owner’s “rights to the shore are exclusive as to all 409. See id. at 397 (citing Bitot, 84 N.W. at 856). 410. See id. (citing Slauson v. Goodrich Transp. Co., 69 N.W. 990, 991 (Wis. 1897) (holding that private property boundary is the low-water mark); Mariner v. Schulte, 13 Wis. 775, 776 (1861) (holding that proprietors hold title down to the low-water mark)). The Doemel court explained that Diana Shooting Club stood for the proposition that “the public right to pursue the sport of hunting to the ordinary water high-water mark of a navigable river [exists] while the waters of the river actually extended to such mark.” Id. at 398. However, this explanation ignores an explicit statement by the court in Diana Shooting Club'. Whether the right exists in the public to hunt on a navigable stream, between ordinary high-water marks, which, owing to a low stage of water, is unnavigable, or on land between such marks which has become dry or exposed, is not involved in this case, and is not decided. Diana Shooting Club v. Husting, 145 N.W. 816, 820 (Wis. 1914). Further, the Diana Shooting Club case involved a navigable river in which the private riparian held title to the center; it was not a case involving state title to the lakebed up to the ordinary high-water mark. See id. at 818. Additionally, the Doemel court misstated the holding in Mariner v. Schulte—involving a dispute on a river where private property boundaries ran to the center of the river—because the statement in that case about property boundaries on ponds and lakes was dicta. See Mariner, 13 Wis. at 776, 781. 411. See Diana Shooting Club, 145 N.W. at 819. 412. See Doemel, 193 N.W. at 398. 413. See id. 4 14. See id. 415.

If a beach walking dispute was revisited today in Wisconsin, a different situation would be presented: the Doemel court’s application of a lineal title theory to exclude all public rights in the public/private beach zone is inconsistent with most of the other Wisconsin Supreme Court cases, and it is certainly at odds with all contemporary decisions. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has confirmed in numerous cases that the state holds title to the beds of navigable lakes up to the ordinary high-water mark.420 Moreover, although individual deeds may show property boundaries at the low-water mark or the water’s edge of lakes, Wisconsin does not recognize the validity of those deeds,421 and with regard to navigable rivers, the court has clearly applied a public trust easement to private title. 22 Indeed, in the present-day decision of R.

In R.W. Docks, riparian landowners’ qualified rights to use the lakebed “strongly influenced” the court’s evaluation of landowner R.W. Docks’ “investment backed expectations” for property that was located below the high- water mark and, thus, was “encumbered by the public trust doctrine and heavily regulated from the get-go.”42h The court reasoned that, “If Docks had no private property right to place boat slips on the lakebed at the marina, it cannot have suffered an unconstitutional taking.”427 While Wisconsin recognizes longstanding riparian rights, these rights are “qualified, subordinate, and subject to the paramount interest of the state and the paramount rights of the public in navigable waters.”428 The court illuminated its role: “We have jealously guarded the navigable waters of this state and the rights of the public to use and enjoy them.”429 Given the established relationship of private rights overlapping with, but subordinate to, public rights in the public/private beach zone and into the lake, the court held the Department of Natural Resources’ denial of a permit to dredge the lakebed and construct seventy-one boat slips on Lake Superior was not an unconstitutional taking of property.430 The Wisconsin Supreme Court’s analysis of riparian rights below the ordinary high-water mark as limited and subordinate to public trust rights may inform future resolution of any beach walking disputes in Wisconsin in the public/private beach zone. The conceptualization of the court’s role as guardian of the public’s interests in navigable waters, as well as the finding of an easement that recognizes overlapping public and private rights,431 was similarly echoed by the Supreme Court of Michigan in its 2005 beach walking decision in Glass v. Goeckel.432 The court noted that “the sovereign must sedulously guard the public’s interest in the seas for navigation and fishing-passed from English courts to the American colonies, to the Northwest Territory, and, ultimately, to Michigan.”433 424.

Maine’s McGarvey decision, Wisconsin’s R. W. Docks and Diana Shooting Club decisions, Michigan’s Glass v. Goeckel decision, and Minnesota’s Korrer decision all applied a sovereignty theory that supported finding an inalienable public trust easement in the public/private beach zone.434 This easement accommodates shared uses and public access.435 Ohio’s Merrill decision provides a contemporary example of how a lineal title approach favors exclusive use of the public/private beach zone by private property owners.436 Further, in understanding the scope of public trust rights, Maine’s Bell II decision, Massachusetts’ Michaelson and Opinion o f the Justices decisions, and Wisconsin’s Doemel v. Jantz decision all apply a fixed theory of public rights to deny beach walking and general recreation in the public/|>rivate beach zone where private title extends to the low-water mark or tide line. These different approaches underscore that, even in states with the same property laws, the results diverge depending on the legal theory animating the decisions. Hence, in the low-water mark states of Maine and Massachusetts, a court that finds an inalienable public trust easement and applies an evolving common law theory will hold in favor of the public’s right to cross the intertidal zone to scuba dive,438 while a court taking a lineal title approach and applying a fixed public rights theory will advise that a proposed statute to secure beach walking rights is an unconstitutional taking.439 Similarly, in a Wisconsin decision that drew the private property boundary at the low-water mark and applied a fixed common law theory, the court denied the public’s right to beach walking, unless the walking takes place in the water.440 However, in a Minnesota decision, the court recognized a public trust easement up to the high- 434.

' In contrast, when justices see that the line for title purposes is not the same as the line for public rights purposes—and therefore recognize a public trust easement—the decisions accommodate multiple shared uses of the public/private beach zone.44’ If the justices follow a sovereignty theory, they will inevitably find a public trust easement in the public/private beach zone.444 The justices’ choice of theory also influences the efficacy of a takings claim. The recognition of an inalienable public trust easement weakens takings claims related to public use of this area, even in low-water states, or when the particulars of a deed indicate exclusive private ownership.445 Moreover, the application of a fixed theory of common law public rights can strengthen private property rights vis a vis the public. Under this theory, public use rights are limited to those originally recognized at the time the colonies separated from England.44'1 If a court describes these original rights as only encompassing fishing, fowling, and navigation, it may then conclude—as the Supreme Courts of Maine and Massachusetts did—that new statutes allowing beach walking or public recreation are an expansion of these fixed public rights and require compensation to private property owners.447 However, a fixed 441.

Goeckel decision also applied a fixed public rights theory to uphold beach walking rights as traditional public rights included in the “right of passage” and as necessary to effectuate other rights of fishing and navigation.449 Michigan’s court held that beach walking has always been recognized within the historic right of passage, as well as the Northwest Territory’s “common highways” and “forever free” protections for navigable waterways.450 In so doing, Michigan provides an example that is both contemporary and historically grounded. C. Takings and Public Rights Beyond the Public/Private Beach Zone In addition to the divergent approaches allowing beach walking in the public/private beach zone, several high-water mark states have expanded protections for public access and recreation onto beach uplands above the public/private beach zone. This Part highlights examples from New Hampshire, New Jersey, and California to demonstrate the potential Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional takings limitations on public beach access. The state interest in creating comprehensive legislation to protect public access for beach walking or general recreation on the coasts must be carefully crafted to avoid running afoul of constitutional protections of private property. Although the statutory creation of a comprehensive beach program is a lawful exercise of the state’s police power, the scope of the property involved in the program, as well as the methods employed to facilitate public access, impact whether it is an unconstitutional “taking” under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, thus requiring the payment of just compensation.451 The Supreme Court has identified two categories of per se regulatory takings: regulations that compel a permanent physical “invasion” of property, and regulations that deny “all economically beneficial or productive use of land.”452 It is highly unlikely that legislation providing public access and recreation on beaches could be shown to deny all economically beneficial or 448. See Glass v. Goeckel, 703 N.W.2d 62, 73-74 (Mich. 2005) (applying a fixed theory, relying on the “traditionally articulated rights protected by the public trust doctrine,” yet holding that walking falls within the scope of the public trust). 449.

A more likely scenario would be an argument that such regulation compelled a permanent physical invasion of the property. Government-compelled permanent physical occupations are per se takings because they strike at the heart of the right to exclude others, which is considered a fundamental property interest.453 The Supreme Court clarified that an easement allowing the public the right to pass may be considered a permanent physical invasion, despite the variable public usage and regardless of the economic impact.454 As with total regulatory takings, one may raise a background principles defense to a permanent physical invasion takings claim.455 Thus, the Supreme Court’s decision in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council56 is relevant.457 In Lucas, the Supreme Court held that a state regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use will not be a taking if “the nature of the owner's estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his title to begin with.”45* A primary issue that arises in the beach access context is whether the statute is merely codifying an existing public right and corresponding limitation on the private estate.454 Such a background principles defense could bar a takings claim brought on a permanent physical invasion theory.460 The Lucas Court explained that “we assuredly would permit the government to assert a permanent easement that was a pre-existing limitation upon the land owner’s title.” 461 This opens up an inquiry into background principles of the state’s property laws. 6~ As Professor Echeverria observed, the public trust doctrine provides a 453.

Lucas did not necessarily adopt a static view of background principles because the Court observed that “changed circumstances or new knowledge may make what was previously permissible no longer so.” 468 Additionally, “there is no physical taking when the plaintiff voluntarily entered into a highly regulated field in which there was no reasonable expectation of being free of invasion when certain events occur.” 464 The fact that coastal property is highly regulated and contingent on public trust rights and the federal navigation servitude, as well as continually being reshaped by natural forces, should inform whether a property owner has a reasonable expectation of being free from invasion. Thus, in low-water mark states—or even in high-water mark states—in which a private title sets boundaries below the ordinary high-water mark, the existence of a public trust easement in the public/private beach zone would constitute such a preexisting limitation on the private title.4711 The issue is inextricably tied to the concept that the state’s trust responsibilities limit its sovereignty and prevent it from completely divesting trust property.471 As noted, some state supreme courts assert that it is beyond the power of the state to pass trust property into private ownership freed of public rights.47' Several key state 463.

In Opinion o f the Justices, the court analyzed each zone differently, which demonstrates the divergent property interests in each zone. 476 Then, this Part focuses on beach access cases in New Jersey and California to show how two densely populated high-water states have attempted to manage competing private property rights and public rights on the beaches; it also focuses on the United States Supreme Court’s reaction to California’s approach in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm ’n. This discussion illuminates the boundaries of takings claims related to public beach access, as well as recreation on the uplands and in the public/private beach zone. 1. New Hampshire Unlike the neighboring states of Maine and Massachusetts, New Hampshire draws the private property boundary at the high-tide line.478 Two years after the Supreme Court decided Lucas, the New Hampshire Supreme Court rendered its Opinion o f the Justices decision, analyzing a proposed state statute that aimed to “recognize and confirm the historical practice and common law right of the public to enjoy the existing public easement” along New Hampshire’s coasts.479 To this end, the proposed legislation articulated a recreational easement in the public/private beach zone and a separate public easement in the dry sand area above the high-water mark.480 rights because “[i]t is beyond the power of the state to alienate [the river bed] freed from such rights” (citing People v.

After the court declared that New Hampshire has always recognized public ownership below the high-water mark,48~ it explained that public ownership overlaps with private littoral owners’ rights to use this zone and access the water.48\" While overlapping, the court clarified that private rights may not “unreasonably interfere with the rights of the public.” 48 Further, public rights in New Hampshire are not restricted to traditional navigation and fishing, as they are in neighboring Massachusetts.488 The New Hampshire Supreme Court embraced an evolving theory of common law public rights, explaining that these traditional public rights “are not the whole estate but rather the public trust lands are held for the use and benefit of all the [public], for all useful purposes . . . .” 486 The court reasoned that because the phrase “all useful purposes” is broad enough to encompass the right to recreate, the proposed statute would merely codify the existing common law.487 In addition to recreation fitting within the contours of a public use right for all useful purposes, the court stated that a recreational right in the public/private beach zone is the same as the previously recognized public rights on the water to “boat, bathe, fish, fowl, skate, and cut ice.” 488 Thus, while New Hampshire applies an evolving theory of common law public rights by employing the open- ended concept of using the lands for all useful purposes, the court also tied the recreational use to already recognized uses—albeit ones that are not necessarily part of the traditional triumvirate.489 The court framed a recreational public use as a preexisting burden on private title, concluding that this part of the proposed legislation was simply a codification of the common law: “Where private title to tidelands is already burdened by preexisting public rights, a regulation designed 481.

If a prescriptive easement exists, it might well represent a background principle that would defeat a takings claim. The justices examined the factual difficulties in establishing a statewide prescriptive easement—which required a showing of adverse use on each tract for twenty years—stating that such an assertion was not within the power of the legislature, but rather, was reserved to the judiciary to decide on a case-by-case basis. Because this part of the proposed law denied private property owners the right to exclude others from property that was not burdened by a background principle of state law, the New Hampshire Supreme Court concluded that this section of the statute would be a taking without just compensation.494 In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on the Supreme Court’s decision in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission^' The justices suggested that if the state wanted to create a comprehensive beach access program for the upland portion of beaches, the legislature had to use its powers of eminent domain and compensate private property owners.496 490.

New Jersey In contrast to New Hampshire, New Jersey recognizes broad public recreational rights on the upland portion of beaches, grounding this recognition in the public trust doctrine.49 In New Jersey, the state holds tidal lands in trust up to the mean high-tide line.498 However, New Jersey has gone farther than most other states in articulating a public trust doctrine that protects public recreational rights not only in the public/private beach zone, but also on private upland beach areas above the high-tide line under some circumstances.499 New Jersey’s courts have produced a collection of beach access decisions that arose out of various scenarios whereby the entity controlling the beach opened it to recreational use by only some people and sought to give preference to residents or to entirely exclude nonresidents.500 In Borough o f Neptune City v. Borough o f Avon-by-the-Sea,5M the court held that, “while municipalities may validly charge reasonable fees for the use of their beaches, they may not discriminate in any respect between their residents and non-residents.”30\" The New Jersey Supreme Court based its holding on the public trust doctrine, which it described as a “deeply inherent right of the citizenry.”50'' In that case, a municipality owned a beach park and boardwalk located on the dry uplands part of the beach, while the state held in trust the beach from the high-tide line to the ocean.504 The municipality charged nonresidents more to access its municipal beach, access to which was necessary to reach the state-held public/private beach the public trust coastal shorelands of New Hampshire for all useful and lawful purposes, to include recreational purposes, subject to the provisions of municipal ordinances relative to the ‘reasonable use’ of public trust shorelands.” Id. § 483-C: 1 (III). 497.

The public trust doctrine, like all common law principles, should not be considered fixed or static, but should be molded and extended to meet changing conditions and needs of the public it was created to benefit.510 Following this evolving theory of public rights, the New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed the inclusion of shore activities and recreation as public rights in its subsequent decision in Matthews v. Bay Head Improvement Ass ’n. 1 In Matthews, the New Jersey Supreme Court retraced the origins of public rights to access the sea through ancient Roman law and English common law.517 The court affirmed Borough o f Neptune City’s extension of the public trust doctrine to include bathing, swimming, and other shore activities as furthering and consistent with the state’s “general welfare.” 513 It also quoted approvingly from the Florida Supreme Court as follows: 506.

Borough o f Deal,5'1 which was decided only a few years after Borough o f Neptune City, stands for the proposition that the public trust doctrine requires “the public be afforded the right to enjoy all dry sand beaches owned by a municipality.”518 In those cases, the New Jersey Supreme Court was not only moved by an evolving theory of public rights on trust property, but also articulated a doctrine that burdens adjacent municipal upland beaches that may be necessary to access and exercise public recreational rights.519 Then, in Matthews v. Bay Head Improvement Ass ’n, the court went beyond municipally-owned upland beaches and considered whether the public trust doctrine similarly required either a right of passage across private uplands to access the public/private beach zone or recreational use of the dry upland beach owned by a nonprofit beach club.520 This beach club owned or leased the dry sand beach uplands and limited membership to municipal residents.5\"1 The club controlled public access to much of the beach along the Atlantic Ocean in the Borough of Bay Head because it owned the beachfront adjacent to seven of the nine roads in the Borough that ended at the beach.522 In reaching its landmark holding that extended the public trust doctrine to private upland beaches, the court was persuaded by a dissenting opinion in an English case from 1821, Blundell v. Catterall, 5 i3 in which Justice Best described bathing in tidal waters as similar to navigation and “passage to the seashore” as “essential to the exercise of that right.”5\"4 Relying on the Blundell dissent, the 514.

An evolving theory of common law public rights clearly motivated the New Jersey Supreme Court in Matthews, just as it had in Borough o f Neptune City,535 The court saw the public trust doctrine as malleable enough to retain relevancy to changing social conditions, stating that “[ajrchaic judicial responses are not an answer to a modem social problem.”536 However, the court’s heavy emphasis on English common law indicated that the New Jersey Supreme Court, similar to courts in New Hampshire and Michigan,557 wanted to anchor public rights in more traditional legal bases.538 None of these cases, however, directly addressed a takings claim in relation to public trust access to private lands. In National Ass ’n o f Home Builders o f the United States v. New Jersey Department o f Environmental Protection, the court considered the meaning of the Matthews factor test in relation to a takings claim under the U.S. Constitution/40 The Homebuilders Association brought a takings challenge to a New Jersey rule requiring property owners to constmct and maintain a thirty-foot-wide public walkway along the entire waterfront of their property as a condition of obtaining a development perm it/41 Most of the land on which the walkway was to be constructed was former trust land that had been filled, but some of the land had not previously been trust land, and the court applied a different standard based on that distinction.64- As to the filled trust lands, the court subscribed to a sovereignty theory.54’ The court held that this land was still burdened by the trust and the private owners did not have the right to exclude the public from this property: the private owners’ “bundle of rights is limited by the public’s right to use and enjoy this portion of the property under the public trust doctrine.”5 4 The court denied a takings challenge to the public trust portion of the property.545 As to the non­ trust uplands, upon which the state required perpendicular access to reach the waterway, the court held the applicable analysis was the Matthews “reasonably 534.

City o f Tigard.546 In summary, New Jersey’s decisions are heavily infused with a sovereignty theory that finds an inalienable public trust easement, coupled with a theory of evolving public rights. In New Jersey, public trust rights include a general right to engage in recreational activities on state-held trust lands in the public/private beach zonef547 a right to access upland municipal beaches, subject to reasonable regulation;54* a right of passage;547 and a right to engage in recreational activities on privately owned beaches, in accordance with a multifactor test aimed at determining whether use of private lands is necessary for “reasonable access” to the public/private beach zone.550 Further, even on filled trust lands, the public trust is not extinguished and still provides background principles of state law that not only limit a landowner’s ability to exclude the public, but also authorize the state to require the landowner to construct and maintain public walkways along the waterfront.551 3. California In California, the state clearly holds in trust all tidelands between the mean high-tide and low-tide lines, submerged lands, and the beds of inland navigable waters. This trust for public uses goes well beyond the traditional triumvirate of fishing, navigation, and commerce to include “nature preserves, swimming, boating, and walking.”55\" The California constitution guarantees the public’s right of access to tidelands, subject to reasonable regulation.553 Moreover, through the state constitution, private property owners are also put on notice that no one possessing the “frontage” of any “navigable water in this State, shall be permitted to exclude the right of way to such water whenever it is required for any public purpose.”554 Finally, the California constitution directs that the legislature “shall enact such laws as will give the most liberal construction to this provision, so that access to the navigable waters of this State shall be always 546. See id. at 360 (citing Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994)). The court then held that it lacked the factual record to determine whether the Matthews “reasonably necessary” test had been met.

Although Matthews involved a privately owned beach, the owner was a beach club and the remedy was opening the club membership to nonresidents of the municipality. See Matthews v.

In furtherance of these state constitutional rights, the California Coastal Act establishes a state goal and directive in the coastal zone to “[mjaximize public access to and along the coast and maximize public recreational opportunities in the coastal zone consistent with sound resources conservation principles and constitutionally protected rights of private property owners.”556 To this end, the California Coastal Commission operates a coastal access program that includes, as a program priority, creating a California coastal trail to increase public access to the entire California coast.777 The commission researches and records prescriptive public access easements, obtains easements from private property owners across the dry sand beaches,577 and produces maps showing the public the location of these access points.560 Additionally, the legislature enacted a statute expressly providing, with some exceptions, that “[p]ublic access from the nearest public roadway to the shoreline and along the coast shall be provided in new development projects.”56' In the dispute that gave rise to the United States Supreme Court decision in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission,562 the state commission argued that it was carrying out its guidelines to further these constitutional and statutory objectives.56’ When reviewing the proposal to rebuild and expand a home along the Pacific Coast, the California Coastal Commission conditioned its approval on the property owner granting an easement for the public to cross a strip of private beach above the mean high-tide line, but below a seawall that ran parallel to the 564ocean. The Supreme Court reviewed this action in Nollan and ultimately held that the easement condition constituted a taking of property.767 The decision is as important for what it held as for what it ignored. Justice Scalia’s majority opinion simply mentioned, at the outset, that the border of the private property is the “historic mean high-tide line” at the ocean, with no reference to the public 555.

See id. at 827. 567. See id. at 832.

Concluding Observations: Takings and Public Access Heavily populated ocean coastal states have been the most active in defining public access to beaches. The above examples from New Hampshire, New Jersey, and California illustrate divergent approaches and analyses of state action to provide public access to beaches within and above the public/private beach zone.579 These cases also articulate an approach to public trust rights that is expansive enough to go beyond beach walking to encompass general beach recreation.55\" While New Hampshire applies an evolving theory of public rights to protect “all useful purposes” on trust lands and New Jersey explicitly rejects an “archaic judicial response,”582 both state supreme courts are unwilling to completely abandon tradition. Even assuming that courts have the authority to revise background principles of state law— in a manner consistent with LucassiZ—when they assert that authority, it is prudent to ground revised, modem conceptions of background principles in traditional rules as much as possible. To the extent that the common law can evolve to stay relevant, it should evolve in gradual, incremental steps. Thus, New Hampshire describes the recreational right in the public/private beach zone as one that has always existed, reasoning that a statute that codifies such a right could not give rise to a takings claim by adjacent private property owners because the new law would not change any burdens on private . 584 property. Although the New Jersey Supreme Court declared that it was not bound by tradition, it too searched for traditional support for a recreational right and a right of access to cross privately owned upland beaches. The New Jersey Supreme Court found such support in a dissenting opinion that does not reflect the 577. See Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 391 (1994). 578.

VI. T o w a r d s a T h e o r y t h a t A c c o m m o d a t e s S h a r e d B e a c h e s Property in land may be seen as consisting of a group of rights, including the right to possess, use, and dispose of the thing. The United States Supreme Court considers “as to property reserved by its owner for private use, the right to exclude [others is] one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.”598 However, beachfront property and the rights associated with it cannot be accurately understood in isolation from the longstanding public significance of beaches, the background principles of public trust and property law that inhere in the title,599 and the natural forces that constantly reshape beaches. This property exists in relation to other parcels, the water, and the members of the public who use coastal areas. As Professor Sax observed about property more generally: Particular parcels are tied to one another in complex ways, and property is more accurately described as being inextricably part of a network of relationships that is neither limited to, nor usefully defined by, the property boundaries with which the legal system is accustomed to dealing. Frequently, use of any given parcel of property is at the same time effectively a use of, or a demand upon, property beyond the border oi the user. Although this observation applies to all property in land, the network concept is even more pronounced when applied to coastal property. This is because coastal property is the place where private land ownership— primarily in uplands—exists alongside the lake and ocean commons, which are clearly held by the public.801 The public/private beach zone of coastal property is where Here, 59 WASH. & Lee L. R e v . 373, 381 (2002) (noting that, in the years since Dolan, lower courts have consistently applied the essential nexus test to land use exactions similar to those challenged in Nollan and Dolan). 595.

See supra notes 11-13 and accompanying text. 2013] Public Access and Private Property Along the Coast 367 these interests overlap and intersect.602 Consider a few examples of this network concept applied to coastal properties. A lakefront property owner who launches fireworks from the portion of the beach she owns to explode and deposit the refuse into the lake necessarily invades the quiet experience of neighboring lakefront property owners on their private land and deposits waste into the shared public lake. Similarly, a lakefront property owner who removes all coastal vegetation and fertilizes a grass lawn down to the shore accelerates algae growth in the lake, thus using her property in a way that degrades the common lake property and impairs the rights of the public and neighboring private property owners to enjoy clean water. Conversely, an all-terrain vehicle enthusiast drives on the public/private beach zone, disturbing private property abutting the shore, as well as other members of the public who share use and enjoyment of the beach. Lastly, the state creates a harbor and installs docks to aid in the public’s navigation, while simultaneously increasing the value of neighboring properties. These examples show that, especially in the public/private beach zone, public and private property uses interact with and burden one another. A legal theory that acknowledges the notion of intertwined and networked uses of this shared property is more compatible with the need to accommodate different, yet interconnected, public and private uses of the public/private beach zone. Such a theory will also be more amenable to mediating conflicting and damaging uses of coastal property. One of the values of the sovereignty theory, which leads to finding an inalienable public trust easement, is that it places an obligation on the state to prevent and protect the public from offending property uses in the public/private beach zone and in the water commons.603 This protection of the public interest has a positive spillover effect on the protection of private property interests as well.6\"4 This theory can lend itself to proactive, preventive state action to regulate multiple uses of the beach, rather than a reliance on litigation of nuisance claims after the fact. All of the cases analyzed in this Article involve conflicts between the public’s ability to enjoy beaches and a private property owner’s right to exclude. Often unrecognized is the impact that these public trust decisions have on other coastal property owners. A lineal title approach has disturbing implications for private coastal landowners.60'’ Although riparian/littoral rights include shared use of the waters of a lake or ocean with other riparians, they do not include shared use of the shoreline.606 Paradoxically, decisions that favor the private fee 602.

Private owners of coastal property have the most frequent access to the beach; yet, these fee owners are restricted to the frontage they own, rather than granted the use of the entire beach, in a state that does not recognize the coexistence of the public trust easement with private title. Further, if a single border is both the end of private property and the beginning of public rights, a strict lineal title approach would weaken the existence of riparian rights below the border and into the state-held trust waters.607 A lineal title approach to understanding the relationship between public and private property along lakeshores and oceans should be only the starting point: a method of dividing legal title between the state and private landowners. s This approach should be followed by finding a public trust easement that protects public usufructuary rights, even when the public/private beach zone is privately owned.609 Such recognition is particularly important in low-water states, where a strict lineal title approach serves to extinguish traditional public rights in the public/private beach zone.610 The better view, consistent with hundreds of years of precedent in both American and English common law, is one informed by a sovereignty theory: it is not within the power of the state to extinguish public rights in the public/private beach zone.6\" Additionally, even in high-water states, deeds may be at variance with this title division at the mean high-tide line, or ordinary high-water mark, and an inalienable public trust easement is better suited to simultaneously recognize individual deeds while not privatizing that which belongs to all—public trust rights.612 The variety of water border descriptions in individual deeds in high- water states presents a situation conceptually similar to private ownership claims in low-water states. In both situations, by applying an easement, the state may 607.

The court erred in assuming, without analysis, that the property line for private title must be the same as the boundary for public trust purposes.

See Abrams, supra note 26, at 898 (discussing how Minnesota allows title to pass to the littoral owners abutting Lake Superior all the way to the low-water mark, but how this title is nonetheless burdened by a paramount servitude that applies the public trust to the area below the ordinary high-water mark). 611. This is the position of the Michigan Supreme Court in Glass, 703 N.W.2d at 65, and the United States Supreme Court in Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois, 146 U.S. 387, 453 (1892); it is also the position of legal scholars, including Professor Robert Abrams. See Abrams, supra note 26, at 898; see also Echeverria, supra note 452, at 951-52 (viewing the public trust doctrine as a constraint on government authority (citing III. Cent. R.R.

See Glass, 703 N.W.2d at 70, 76. 2013] Public Access and Private Property Along the Coast 369 maintain public trust rights in the public/private beach zone without extinguishing private title.613 Especially in these situations, the English common law concept of overlapping jus privatum and jus publicum is instructive as to how to accommodate the coexistence of multiple rights on the same property— and has been a serviceable approach throughout the centuries.614 Thus, the coastal estate is best understood as one that involves severable private and public rights. Even when a private owner holds title below the high- water or high-tide line, the state does not extinguish public trust rights—which the state holds in its sovereign capacity as trustee of the property the Federal Government granted to it under the equal footing doctrine.61'' A sovereignty theory is also most consistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent in Illinois Central and Shively, in which the Court acknowledged state power to alter the state title boundaries after entering the Union, but conditioned that power on the preservation of public rights.616 The public/private beach zone is suitable to usufructuary rights, but not to private^possessioii in the sense of landowners retaining the ability to exclude the public.6 7 That is not to say, however, that all usufructs should be allowed in this zone—that determination is bounded by recognized public trust and riparian/littoral rights. Of the competing theories undergirding the common law of public trust rights, an evolving theory is most amenable to ensuring that the public trust doctrine is relevant to society as a modern reconception of traditional rules. 1 ’ Beach walking has been recognized as a traditional public trust right of “passage and repassage” by courts applying a fixed theory of the common law, but it has also been rejected under the same theory.619 A fixed theory not only yields inconsistent results, but the idea advanced by a small minority of states— that public rights are forever locked in as those uses that were most important to society in the seventeenth century—is too rigid a theory to ensure the continued 613.

Although an evolving theory of public trust rights makes private property in this zone less certain, coastal private rights are less certain than other land ownership by their very nature. Even before the public trust easement is considered, coastal private lands have ambulatory boundaries that change over time by forces of nature: some of these natural forces are gradually adding or removing land (accretion and erosion), suddenly eliminating large swaths or the entirety of the private parcel by completely submerging it under water (avulsion), or creating a retreat of water that undermines investments in piers left high and dry (reliction).621 With the climate-influenced rise of sea levels622 and the lowering of certain lake levels,621 the ambulatory nature of coastal property boundaries is even more visible in a shorter timeframe. VII. C o n c l u s io n Coastal properties are in ftux due to the forces of nature to which they are subjected and their relationship to state and federal protections for the public. They are always subject to the federal government’s navigation servitude that allows private property to be destroyed without compensation.6-4 In addition, they are subject to the state’s public trust doctrine.626 Against this universally understood backdrop of uncertainty in coastal private land ownership, public trust rights are simply one more acknowledgement that coastal property is unusually dynamic, and that the public/private beach zone is unsuitable for permanent, exclusive private ownership. To view coastal private property rights in isolation from the rights of neighboring private property owners and adjacent public trust lands is a legal fiction. The better-reasoned beach access cases tend to view coastal property rights as conditioned and contingent on an inalienable public trust easement. As observed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, these coastal properties are 620. See Kalo, supra note 23, at 1437-38 (citing GOULD, supra note 23, at 310-11). 621.

This approach allows for consistency across and between states, and puts private property owners on notice that coastal property is treated differently under the law. Once coastal property is understood as contingent on the public trust doctrine and variable by the forces of nature, it becomes easier to see that an evolving theory of public rights is most capable of the flexibility the common law needs to adapt to contemporary challenges. Finally, the need to protect the public’s right to use and enjoy trust lands and waters must be balanced against the need for private property protections. States under increasing pressure to open up more beach property to the public are bounded by the constitutional protections that prohibit a taking of private property without just compensation.627 Although not as relevant in the public/private beach zone, the takings prohibition serves to limit the state from encroaching above this zone, unless allowed by background principles of state property and public trust law.6~x A sovereignty theory that finds an inalienable public trust easement and an evolving common law of public rights is flexible enough to accommodate shared beaches, while the prohibitions against takings of property properly prevent the state from overreaching. 626.
