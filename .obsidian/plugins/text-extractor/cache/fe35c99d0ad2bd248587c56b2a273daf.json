Probabilities are numbers from 0 to 1. We often speak of chances that run from 0% to 100%. EXAMPLE 1: Consider the probability of drawing the queen of hearts from a deck of 52 cards. P (queen of hearts) = because there are 52 cards and 1 is the queen of hearts. P (diamond) = because there are 13 diamonds. P (queen of hearts OR 7 of diamonds) = because there are two ways to win. You win if you draw the queen of hearts OR the 7 of diamonds. P (queen of hearts AND 7 of diamonds) = It is the probability of drawing the queen of hearts, keeping it, AND then drawing the 7 of diamonds. Note that in probability, “or” implies addition and “and” implies multiplication. EXAMPLE 2: Consider the probability of rolling a 3 on a fair die (die being the singular of dice). P (3) = because there are 6 sides for the die to land on and only one side is the 3. Consider the probability of not rolling a 3. P (not 3) = because 5 out of six of the sides are not the 3. NOTE: P (3 OR not 3) = + = = 1. There is a 100% chance that when you roll a fair die, it will land on 3 or not land on 3. 1 52 13 52 2 52 1 52 × 1 51 = 1 2,652 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 6 6 Page of 1 3 EXAMPLE 3: Consider the probability of drawing three diamonds, keeping them as you go. P (diamond AND diamond AND diamond) = EXAMPLE 4: If the probability of an event, call it event A, happening is 0.62, then the probability of event A not happening is 0.38. P (A) = 0.62 P (not A) = 0.38 P (A OR not A) = 1 There is a 100% chance that event A will happen, or it will not. Please note that P (not A) is often denoted as P(Ā). The placement of a dash above the A, indicates not A. EXAMPLE 5: Be aware that the probability of being born in June = , not , because the months do not all have the same number of days. A person is more likely to be born in December (31 days) than June (30 days). For the purpose of introductory statistics, we ignore leap year and consider that there are 365 days in a year. P (born in June) = P (not born in June) = P (born on December 2nd ) = 13 52 × 12 51 × 11 50 30 365 1 12 30 365 335 365 1 365 Page of 2 3 EXAMPLE 6: Consider the probability of guessing a four-digit pin number. There are ten choices for each digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). You can reuse numbers. For example, a pin could be 3 3 7 7. You have 1 chance in 10 of guessing each one of the 4 digits AND AND AND = 0.0001 EXAMPLE 7: Consider the probability of rolling a 4 with a fair die and then flipping a coin and having it land on tails. P (4 AND Tails) = = EXAMPLE 8: A multiple-choice question has 5 possible answers. You can guess a, b, c, d, or e. Consider the probability of randomly guessing the correct answer for the described multiple-choice question AND then correctly guessing on a true or false question. = 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 × 1 10 × 1 10 × 1 10 = 1 104 = 1 10,000 1 6 × 1 2   1 12 1 5 × 1 2   1 10 Page of 3 3","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
