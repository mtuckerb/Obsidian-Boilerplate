Masters and dissertation students also have my permission to use and publish the Self-Compassion Scale in their theses. The appropriate reference is listed below. Best, Kristin Neff, Ph. D. Associate Professor Educational Psychology Dept. University of Texas at Austin e-mail: kneff@austin.utexas.edu Reference: Neff, K. D. (2003). Development and validation of a scale to measure self-compassion. Self and Identity, 2, 223-250. Coding Key: Self-Kindness Items: 5, 12, 19, 23, 26 Self-Judgment Items: 1, 8, 11, 16, 21 Common Humanity Items: 3, 7, 10, 15 Isolation Items: 4, 13, 18, 25 Mindfulness Items: 9, 14, 17, 22 Over-identified Items: 2, 6, 20, 24 Subscale scores are computed by calculating the mean of subscale item responses. To compute a total self-compassion score, reverse score the negative subscale items before calculating subscale means - self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification (i.e., 1 = 5, 2 = 4, 3 = 3. 4 = 2, 5 = 1) - then compute a grand mean of all six subscale means. Researchers can choose to analyze their data either by using individual sub-scale sores or by using a total score. (This method of calculating the total score is slightly different than that used in the article referenced above, in which each subscale was added together. However, I find it is easier to interpret the total score if a mean is used.) HOW I TYPICALLY ACT TOWARDS MYSELF IN DIFFICULT TIMES Please read each statement carefully before answering. To the left of each item, indicate how often you behave in the stated manner, using the following scale: Almost Almost never always 1 2 3 4 5 _____ 1. I’m disapproving and judgmental about my own flaws and inadequacies. _____ 2. When I’m feeling down I tend to obsess and fixate on everything that’s wrong. _____ 3.
