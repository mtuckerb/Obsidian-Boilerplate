Violence came to deﬁne the twentieth century. We live in fear that an even more extreme violence will characterize the twenty- ﬁrst century. The city of Hiroshima was the victim of the greatest single stroke of violence in the history of humanity. Yet it managed to arise, Phoenix-like, as a city devoted to peace in the aftermath of nuclear horror. How was this extraordinary forgiveness possible? Is it possible that it was born out of a compassion for the victims of nuclear holocaust that extended beyond its immediate borders? In several works, but most notably in Upheavals of Thought, Martha Nussbaum has analyzed the conditions for the occurrence of compas- sion. She has also subjected her largely Aristotelian analysis of com- passion to a Stoic-inspired critique. This paper will reconstruct Nussbaum’s analysis, critique, and defense of compassion. I will then extend Nussbaum’s analysis to argue how a forgiveness rooted in compassion, rather than mercy, might be possible. The city of Hiroshi- ma’s dedication to worldwide peace in the aftermath of nuclear horror is used to illustrate a compassion-based forgiveness.

In his essay “From Cruelty to Goodness,”1 Philip Hallie recognized that evil does not end with the simple cessation of violence, for violence burns into its victims a memory that is all too likely to reinitiate the violence. The victim of violence is all too frequently scarred with a desire for revenge and a feeling of inferiority, and from these imprints of violence, the cycle of violence is frequently renewed. Hallie argues that a generosity that welcomes the scarred victims back into the human race is needed to heal the wounds of violence. I want to pursue a slightly different route. Building upon the work of Martha Nussbaum, my eventual intent in this paper is to articulate what a forgiveness grounded upon compassion rather than mercy might look like. I will conclude the paper by arguing how the city of Hiroshima, in the aftermath of the dropping of the atomic bomb, illustrates this type of forgiveness. Martha Nussbaum, in several works—but most extensively in her book Upheavals of Thought 2—has delineated what she sees as two prevailing and competing trends in the history of Western philosophy: a dominant, majority view that she designates the “pro-mercy, anti- pity” position, and a minority position that she designates the “pro-pity or compassion” position. The “anti-pity” position originates with Plato, is crystallized in the Stoic writings of Epictetus and Seneca, and ﬁnds its modern expression in philosophers as diverse as Kant and Nietzsche. The “pro-pity” or compassion position Nussbaum ﬁnds most explicitly in Rousseau and present but ambiguously so in Adam Smith, but, she argues, originates and is voiced most strongly in Aristotle, in particular the Aristotle of the Nicomachean Ethics, the Poetics, and the Rhetoric. For what these Aristotelian texts tell us, as Nussbaum puts it in the title of her most popular book, is that the goodness humans seek is inherently a fragile goodness, fragile in that it is in part dependent upon on external goods, of which bad fortune can deprive us. 3 Nussbaum’s interpretation of Aristotle is itself controversial, seen as nuanced and insightful by some, and simply wrongheaded by others. My concern in this paper is not that of a scholar of Aristotle or Epictetus attempting to determine whether Nussbaum got these ﬁgures “right” or not. Instead, I wish to look at her analysis of the phenomena of compassion and mercy, independent of their provenance. 232 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology Nussbaum will argue that forgiveness comes more naturally to the Stoic advocate of mercy than to the Aristotelian advocate of pity or compassion. Yet, in trying to rescue compassion from its critics, she supplies us with clues of how a forgiveness grounded in compassion might be possible. It is this possibility that I will explore. II The Conditions for Compassion THE FIRST POINT to note is that compassion is an emotion, speciﬁcally, Aristotle tells us, a feeling of pain, directed toward “the misfortune one believes to have befallen another.” 4 But emotions for Aristotle are not simple blind urges in contrast to reason and to be harnassed by reason, as Nussbaum argues that they are for Plato.5 Rather, emotions are both “intentional” in that they are directed outward toward some- thing and “cognitive” in that a series beliefs are embedded into an emotion’s constitution, making the emotion not “blind,” but instead possessing a mental component. 6 Emotions are thus not merely sus- ceptible to the inﬂuence of reason. Instead, Nussbaum interprets Aristotle’s Rhetoric as making a stronger and more nuanced claim, that emotions are more accurately understood as a blend of a feeling and of reason, in that reason in the form of a cluster of beliefs is an integral part of an emotion’s makeup. Three beliefs are necessarily present in the emotion of compassion, an emotion that Nussbaum states that Aristotle in the Rhetoric argues is “a painful emotion directed at another person’s misfortune or suffering.” 7 The ﬁrst is the belief that the suffering undergone by the other is signiﬁcant—that is, large and serious—and not trivial. 8 It is serious suffering that can be recognized as damaging to the well-being of the person in question. Nussbaum accurately notes that while there is a large cross-cultural agreement on events that count as serious and not trivial suffering—“death, bodily assault, illness, [and the] absence of good prospects”—that there is a cultural variability on many events as to whether they are considered serious, or more exactly, the degree to which they are considered serious.9 The example Nussbaum gives is that political injustices are given greater weight in American society than in the Athens of Aristotle’s time. Mercy, Compassion, and Forgiveness 233 The issue Nussbaum fails to address as fully as she may have is that, with the exception of death and its ﬁnality, suffering does not fall neatly into categories of opposition, such as “serious” on the one hand or “trivial” on the other. Suffering obviously occurs in degrees, and determining the degree is a question of judgment. But in Nussbaum’s account, the belief or afﬁrmative judgment that the suffering is serious is all that is needed for compassion to occur, regardless of the objective correctness of that judgment. The occurrence of compassion is then of necessity a subjective affair, contingent upon the degree of suffering that the observer assesses to be present in the other. But the reverse side of this is that one can subjectively assess what by most measures would be considered serious suffering as instead trivial. Michael Moore’s movie Roger and Me includes a scene in which two upper-class women teeing off at a Flint, Michigan country club are interviewed during a time when close to 30,000 workers had been laid off by General Motors. When these privileged, leisure-class duffers were asked what they thought of so many people suffering in Flint, they answered, in an irony that ﬂew over their heads, that “they [the laid-off workers, not themselves] don’t want to work.” This blindness or hard-heartedness to the sufferings of others is, as we will see, closely related to the third belief necessary for compas- sion to occur, that the undeserved suffering of the other is viewed by the witness of suffering as a real possibility for him- or herself. But Nussbaum draws two strong points from the above: First, that com- passion, relying as it does upon subjective evaluation, can err in the judgment it makes, as most would agree that the upper-class duffers have erred in their judgment; and second, in claiming—against Nietzsche and others—that suffering is generally not ennobling, and to the contrary tends to coarsen one’s character. Nussbaum argues, plausibly in my eyes, that this in turn leads to a second way that subjective evaluations of the seriousness of suffering can be in error. For out of a coarsening of his own character and/or a resignation to a situation he ﬁnds himself in, a person can misperceive his own situation, not evaluating the suffering that has befallen him as serious enough, and as a result not having sufﬁcient compassion for himself. 10 The second appraisal or belief that is necessary for the emotion of compassion to occur is that the suffering undergone by the other is 234 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology unmerited, thus tying the emotion of compassion to the perception of violations of justice. 11 Thus for compassion to occur, there must be a perception that the one who suffers is not at fault, or that if fault is present, that the suffering endured is disproportionate to the degree of culpability. The second belief, then, judges that the person has under- gone suffering, not through any—or through little—fault of their own, but instead because of “bad luck.” In general, this will mean that it will be the good person, the one who has been largely successful in cultivating moral excellence and who is blameless with regard to his or her misfortune, who will be the recipient of compassion. But in a very important modiﬁcation, Nussbaum goes on to argue that it is consistent with Aristotle’s account that the blameworthy as well as the blameless can be the recipients of compassion. 12 This is so in that there is a link between the experience of compassion and the perception that an injustice has occurred. 13 Hence, even if a person is not morally excellent and indeed is at fault for the condition he or she ﬁnds himself in, this can still be the occasion for compassion if the suffering undergone is not proportionate to the degree of blame. If a sense of balance that justice demands between the wrong committed and the punishment received is not attained, then under these cir- cumstances, compassion is properly extended to the blameworthy. We can and should feel compassion to the worker who has lost her job because she has developed over time the vice of procrastination. The suffering—no longer having a job—seems disproportionate to the absence of moral excellence. And even when a person appears fully blameworthy, there can be hidden factors, often attributed to circum- stance, that can mitigate their blameworthiness. Nussbaum uses a wonderful phrase of the “tragedy of being sixteen” to illustrate the compassion that we can feel for the otherwise totally blameworthy act a person has performed out of the foolishness of youth, an age that they are not responsible for being, but by “bad fortune,” just happen to be. 14 What is crucial to notice is that in this case, forgiveness arises out of an emotion of compassion. The third condition for the occurrence of compassion found in Aristotle is what Nussbaum calls a “judgment of similar possibili- ties.” 15 In short, this requirement says that in order for compassion to occur, one must view the plight of the suffering other as a real Mercy, Compassion, and Forgiveness 235 possibility for oneself. We see this in the fear that Aristotle says the audience of tragedies undergoes. The aesthetic experience of fear stems from the judgment that I, too, could undergo the suffering that the tragic hero experiences, and that his vulnerability is mine as well. It is, then, through a recognition that one shares the vulnerabilities of the other that the possibility of compassion toward the other is opened. A passage Nussbaum quotes from the Rhetoric emphasizes the experiential dimension of “the judgment of similar possibilities,” stating that “compassion will be felt only by those with some expe- rience and understanding of the suffering.” 16 A second passage emphasizes the deleterious effects of hubris by stating that “one will not have compassion if one thinks that one is above suffering and has everything.” 17 Nussbaum at this point purposively links Aristotle to Rousseau—the other principal member of the “pro-pity” tradition—to assist her in taking the ancient quality of hubris, for which the context is generally the arrogance of taking oneself to be fully self-sufﬁcient and therefore godlike, and translating it through the political lenses of modernity, which now allows hubris to be understood as a hard- hearted arrogance for which class difference is the breeding ground. In doing so, Nussbaum begins to attribute qualities to the pro- compassion tradition, grounded as it is in Aristotle, political implica- tions that are nowhere to be seen in the Politics. The theoretical thread is established between Aristotle and Rousseau by virtue of the beau- tiful passage Nussbaum quotes at length from Emile where Rousseau, through a series of rhetorical questions, drives home the point that if there is too great a difference in class between the sufferer and the one who witnesses that suffering, that the chances of compassion or pity occurring are greatly diminished. 18 For if the gap in social position is large enough, the one of the higher class will typically fail to make the judgment that the suffering of the lower is a genuine possibility for them, judging instead that their higher-class status has made them invulnerable to the woes that have befallen their social inferiors. For Rousseau, and by extension for Nussbaum’s Aristotle, a hardening of the heart is the likely outcome of excessive social stratiﬁcation. This is precisely what we saw with the upper-class duffers in the Michael Moore movie. 236 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology The unity of Nussbaum’s Aristotelian account of compassion is that not only are there three beliefs that are necessary for compassion to occur—the judgment that the suffering is serious; the judgment that the suffering is unmerited or out of proportion to its cause; and the judgment of similar possibilities—but that all of these judgments are grounded in awareness of a tragic situation. Tragedy and compassion exist in a dialectical relationship in that each is the ground of the other. It is exposure to tragic circumstances or theatrical tragedy that acts as the cause of compassion. But at the same time it is the prior cultivation of compassion that makes one more aware of and sensitive to the occurrence of tragic circumstances. Again, the duffers were by virtue of their class status shielded from tragic circumstances and had thus failed to develop a sufﬁcient amount of compassion that would enable recognition of a tragic circumstance in their midst. Furthermore, the second cause—the recognition that the suffering endured in even those at fault is out or proportion to its cause—gives us a ﬁrst insight into how forgiveness can be rooted in compassion. III Stoic Criticisms of Compassion: Forgiveness as Mercy NUSSBAUM CONSTRUCTS an imaginary debate between the pro- compassion tradition that I have outlined and that she wishes to defend, and the pro-mercy tradition, which she sees as rooted in Plato and crystallized in the Stoics. This artiﬁcial dialogue allows the Stoic-rooted mercy advocates to raise several objections against the compassion tradition. Central among these concerns is the inad- equacy of compassion to ground forgiveness. This claim is made on the basis that human tragedy itself is generally based upon an error in judgment. The ﬁrst point at which the Stoic pro-mercy position is at logger- heads with the “pro-compassion” position is that the Stoic position, as Nussbaum reconstructs it, believes that compassion, while capable of judgment, is prone to making wrong judgments with regard to what the best human life is and how to attain it. The fundamental error in judgment it makes is to wrongly attribute importance to what in fact has no importance at all. 19 The Stoic pro-mercy position, at its Mercy, Compassion, and Forgiveness 237 extreme, claims that external goods play absolutely no role nor importance in attaining eudaimonia, whereas the pro-compassion position we have seen Nussbaum articulate through Aristotle empha- sizes that humans are needy, vulnerable creatures, in need of at least a base level of ephemeral external goods, including friendship, in order to ﬂourish. Humanity, in the eyes of the pro-compassion posi- tion, is therefore subject to tragedies when it is deprived of these fundamental external goods. When this deprivation occurs, compas- sion is the appropriate response. The Platonic/Stoic position is fundamentally anti-tragic insofar as bad fortune cannot tragically deprive one of well-being, insofar as well-being does not rely upon external goods of which fortune can rob us. Instead, human ﬂourishing is a matter of virtue alone, which is fully under one’s control. And virtue is largely a matter of how one actively responds to what has passively been done to one by the winds of fortune. What matters is not what happens to one by fortune, which is out one’s control and can just as easily be beneﬁcial as harmful, but how one responds to what happens, which is fully in one’s control. And the wise and virtuous person responds to what the “pro-compassion” advocate recognizes as tragedy with “Stoic indiffer- ence,” since the Stoic recognizes that happiness in no way depends upon the presence of external goods, and hence is indifferent to the loss of any such goods. The Stoic sage is therefore immune to tragedy, since nothing that would rob her of her happiness can happen to the Stoic sage. Since she is fully self-sufﬁcient, the only possession that has any bearing on her happiness is that which cannot be robbed from her, and what is hers and hers alone—her virtue. Therefore, compas- sion is never an appropriate response insofar as it grounded in giving value to what in fact has no real value. The second error of judgment that, according to the reconstructed Stoic position, the advocates of compassion make is that a prejudice born of parochialism lies at the heart of compassion’s moral claims. 20 Compassion errs in that what it feels compassion for is what is local and immediately at hand and, as a result, compassion is guilty of a partiality toward the close at hand. Why is this so? As Nussbaum has emphasized, compassion is an emotion that is inten- tional in nature, and therefore directed toward and inherently 238 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology “attached” to things of the world. The attachment occurs naturally to what is immediate, to what a person concretely comes into contact with in his or her life. Compassion responds to the pain it can see with its eyes, and its natural expression is the embrace of care. Compassion exists in the realm of experience, the immediate expe- rience of suffering ﬂesh and blood, and while infused with a cog- nitive dimension, compassion remains primarily an emotion, albeit a particularly strong emotion. Its only way to extend beyond the pain encountered in the immediate here and now is through the aid of the imagination. I can imagine the pain of the starving in Darfur, but since I don’t experience it ﬁrsthand, I can only imagine it. Insofar as the event remains secondhand and not directly experienced, it tends not to affect me as much as the hunger that I can experience ﬁrsthand of someone in my hometown. In the ﬁrst case, the expe- rience is dulled, neither vivid nor trustworthy, for, the Stoic critic argues along the lines of Plato’s divided line, imagination is the mental faculty most removed from reality and is furthermore prone to misrepresentation and distortion. This “attachment” as a form of deeply personal caring should be contrasted with the impersonal “detachment” or distance that the Stoics, reaching back to Plato, associate with reason. Because of compassion’s deep roots in sensory experience, the Stoic charges that it errs ethically in that it is of necessity local and limited in its range. It fails to attain the universality of scope that moral judgment requires and, as a result, it fails to attain the impartiality that moral judgment requires. Simply put, there is a built-in favoritism to the close at hand in judgments of compassion, and a resulting bias that fails to treat equals as equals. The ﬁnal objection of Nussbaum’s Stoic interlocutor is the claim that taking one’s ethical bearings from compassion leads to a fostering of revenge. 21 If vulnerable external goods—friends, family, children, a reasonable amount of material well-being—are constituent parts of happiness, as the pro-compassion tradition argues, then the Stoic critic retorts that, while this is in fact the soil out of which compassion grows, it is also the breeding ground for a host of undesirable emotions. For if one accepts the place of external goods in a schema of happiness, then Nussbaum qua Stoic writes: Mercy, Compassion, and Forgiveness 239 This means that she allows her own good to rest in the hands of fortune. And to admit one’s own vulnerability to fortune is to have all the raw material not only for compassion, but also for fear and anxiety and grief; and not only for these, but for anger and the retributive disposition as well. 22 In short, if vulnerable and transient external goods are seen by the pro-compassion tradition as a necessary component of happiness, then the Stoic retort is that the underside of compassion is that one will always live in a state of anticipatory fear and anxiety that these goods may be robbed from you. If you lose these goods through fortune, the natural reaction, claims the Stoic, is one of lasting grief coupled with anger directed toward fate, God, or the dice roll of nature. If you lose these goods by the hand of another, then as victim, the feelings of grief and anger are augmented by a desire for revenge, now directed toward the victimizer. Compassion, then, all too easily transforms itself into the poisonous emotion of revenge to those closest at hand, the one who rightly or wrongly is perceived by the victim as the victimizer. Compassion, far from being simply the feeling of the other’s suffering, is in fact the breeding ground for the poison- ous feelings of revenge. Ironically enough, according to the logic of Stoicism, compassion can and often is the ground of war, and not peace, as its sympathizers would naturally think. It is for this reason that the Stoic tradition counsels mercy rather than compassion, and argues that forgiveness more naturally and properly ﬂows from mercy than it does from compassion. Compas- sion, argues Nussbaum’s Stoic, is never an appropriate response to anyone in any situation, for it wrongly presupposes that external goods are a necessary part of one’s happiness. Like Socrates respond- ing to the challenge of Glaucon in the Republic, the Stoic will claim that virtue and virtue alone is needed for happiness. One can never be a victim because what can be taken from one simply doesn’t matter. Yet wrongs do occur. The all too human of us who fall short of the Stoic ideal of virtuous self-control make mistakes and commit wrongs. And when robbed of our external goods on which we weakly depend, we undergo grief and anger. The proper response in neither case is to show compassion, but instead to offer mercy. From the perspective of the Stoic, a wrong has been committed by both parties, the victim and 240 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology the victimizer. The victim has erred, perhaps out of a weakness of character, in making the judgment that external goods are of real importance for happiness. The Stoic response is not one of compas- sion to their cries of grief, but one of mercy or forgiveness for their poor judgment concerning the role of the importance of external goods for their happiness. For the pursuit and loss of such illusory goods has led them to make a nonvirtuous, grieving spectacle of themselves, or worse, has begun to cultivate a desire in them for revenge that will only perpetuate a cycle of violence. With regard to the victimizer, they, too, have made the same error in judgment regarding what is necessary for happiness, an error that has led them to commit a wrong by violently depriving their neighbor of the same illusory good, may it be their wealth, their spouse, or their child. The proper response is not compassion but, again, mercy or forgiveness. And in both cases, the forgiveness is not an unconditional forgiveness. The victim and victimizer alike are seen as blameworthy and held responsible for the judgments and consequent actions that led them to their circumstance. Forgiveness is given only on the prior acknowl- edgment of guilt. IV Nussbaum’s Innovation: The Eudaimonistic Judgment NUSSBAUM’S STOIC INTERLOCUTOR has identiﬁed key weaknesses in the pro-compassion position, and has argued that a properly conditioned forgiveness, where culpability is insisted upon, stems more naturally from Stoic virtue than from compassion. For not only is compassion narrow in range, but more damningly, it is apt to mutate into its opposite, a poisonous desire for revenge when those who are near at hand are seen as victims of undeserved violence. Rather than forgiving those who do harm to those I feel love and compassion for, my love for the victim that I know will more likely convert into a desire to inﬂict revenge on the unknown or little known victimizer, the Stoic has argued. The ironic outcome is that compassion is then the mother of war, both small-scale and large-scale. Notice that the two issues are linked. If the narrow ﬁeld in which compassion is active could be expanded, then the likelihood of Mercy, Compassion, and Forgiveness 241 compassion mutating into revenge would be lessened. For if I have compassion for the victimizer as well as the victim, my natural impulse to seek revenge against the victimizer is largely defused. Both are in the orbit of my concern. And Nussbaum has already given us a crucial clue as to how forgiveness could be grounded in compassion with the example of the blameworthy teenager who has undergone the “tragic experience” of being 16. Mistakes are made, but we can and do forgive out of the compassion that is generated by recognition of their tragic circumstance. Nussbaum’s response to the narrowness of the compassion problem is to supplement the cognitive conditions of compassion that she has drawn from Aristotle by her own innovation, what she calls the “eudaimonistic judgment.” The eudaimonistic judgment will be both Nussbaum’s acknowledgment to the Stoic critic that compassion in its natural condition lacks range and subsequently leads to a desire for revenge, but will also be the vehicle that will let Nussbaum expand the range of compassion. How can this be? In the long run, the eudaimonistic judgment will best be understood as an attempt to expand the scope of the “similar possibilities” condition for the occurrence of compassion. As we will see, it will be through the use of imagination that more and more people will fall under the compass of who among the sea of humanity has similar and, indeed, tragic possibilities as us. But ﬁrst, what does she mean by a eudaimonistic judgment, which now acts as the fourth condition for the occurrence of compassion? Nussbaum writes: In order for compassion to be present, the person must consider the suffering of another as a signiﬁcant part of his or her own scheme of goals and ends. She must take that person’s ill as affecting her own ﬂourishing. In effect she must make herself vulnerable in the person of another. 23 Nussbaum wants to claim that my own eudaimonia, or ﬂourishing happiness, depends upon my formulating a cluster of goals and goods to which I attach value, which in turn are constituent elements of a conception of what it means for me to live well. For compassion to then occur, I must make the eudaimonistic judgment that the other’s well-being is included in my personal conception of well-being. In other words, if I have made the judgment that my wife’s and children’s 242 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology well-being matter to me, then I will not ﬂourish if they are not ﬂourishing. I suffer with the suffering of my child, and my lack of personal ﬂourishing will be evident in the emotion of deep compas- sion and concomitant sadness I display in the face of their suffering. There are several points worth noting here. First, as Nussbaum’s Stoic interlocutor has emphasized, the judgments made with regard to compassion and, indeed, all emotions are highly personal, partial, and local, and not impersonal, impartial, and universal. It is my children whose pain pains me. It is Nussbaum’s mother whose death triggers grief and compassion in her. Second, Nussbaum appears to have made a decided, but unstated, shift to Kant at this point. The cluster of goods or ends that Aristotle argues are constituent for eudaimonia to occur are not up for grabs, are not goods that gain their goodness because I personally value them. There is a best way of living for humans, regardless of my opinions on what that might be. Nussbaum’s eudaimonia is under- girded by a Kantian-inspired notion of autonomy often expressed in liberal contemporary political philosophy as government neutrality with regard to ends. Autonomy thus understood means that you are free to choose what ends constitute your personal conception of eudaimonia, and that there are not ends given by nature. There is a further Kantian element at work in the entire argument we are looking at in this section. Nussbaum speaks throughout of the three requirements necessary for compassion to occur or, in Kantian language, the three “conditions for the possibility” of compassion. That is all well and ﬁne, but what strikes me in the quoted passage above describing the eudaimonistic judgment is that it is difﬁcult to differentiate the prior necessary conditions for the occurrence of compassion from a description of the event of compassion itself. For what is compassion other than making oneself “vulnerable in the person of another”? My point, then, is that Nussbaum seems to blur the distinction between the conditions for compassion and compassion itself, and if this is the case, the necessary conditions for the occur- rence of compassion may have to be sought elsewhere. The second question is how the criticisms of compassion that the Stoic has lodged become acknowledged in the eudaimonistic judg- ment, and subsequently overcome. Mercy, Compassion, and Forgiveness 243 The chief deﬁciencies of the eudaimonistic judgment are that, ﬁrst, there is no necessity that it occur, insofar as there is no need that I make the judgment that the well-being of someone at work who I don’t particularly like is necessary for my own well-being. And second, when the eudaimonistic judgment does occur, it tends, as the Stoic has pointed out, to be “local” and of limited scope. I feel compassion immediately for my children’s pain; not so immediately, if at all, for the unknown, faceless stranger. The real issue at stake for Nussbaum is whether the range of compassion is of necessity local in nature as the Stoics contend, or if it only tends to be local in nature. If the latter is the case, then an expansion of the range of the eudaimonistic judgment will at the same time be the expansion of the scope of the third condition, those whom we see as having similar possibilities as ourselves. With regard to its local nature, it is to be noted that the eudai- monistic judgment is just that, a judgment. Judgments are acts of cognition in that the action is a mental assessment of something and not simply feeling that strikes most as inherently passive in nature. Now Nussbaum, in both The Upheaval of Thought and especially The Fragility of Goodness, has argued that the dichotomy of mind as active and feelings as passive is a holdover from a Platonic error that endures throughout most of the “pro-mercy” tradition. 24 Feelings, she argues via a somewhat novel yet to my ears compelling interpretation of Aristotle, are not purely passive in nature and, to the contrary, include within them an active, cognitive dimension. They are this way in that they are “intentional.” It is beyond the scope of this paper to give a full account of Nussbaum’s interpretation of the emotions in Aristotle that relies heavily on the signiﬁcance of a word orexis,a word she claims he probably invented and is interpreted as meaning “goal-directed animal movement.” 25 But the general point she makes is fairly straightforward. The feeling of fear, for example, is never a pure and diffuse feeling, but is always a fear of something that is judged as dangerous. For example, if you encounter a grizzly bear in the woods, the emotion of fear occurs only insofar as a constituent part of fear is a judgment that the grizzly bear standing before you is dangerous. In that fear is always a fear of something—the grizzly bear in this example—the emotion not only includes a judgment, but is 244 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology additionally intentional, in that it is always object-oriented, and directed emotion is object-oriented, as the object of emotions has a marked tendency to be empirical in character and close at hand. I can imagine a grizzly bear attacking through the skillful storytelling of a novelist, and have some experience of fear, but the emotion I might experience is heavily diluted when compared to the encounter with the actual, empirical bear at hand. So the local nature of emotions, including compassion, ultimately stems from their intentional charac- ter, which in the most vivid sense, is directed toward what is empiri- cally close to us. V Beyond Nussbaum: Forgiveness Through Compassion THE QUESTION FOR Nussbaum becomes how can the eudaimonistic judgment, a fourth judgment now claimed as a necessary condition of compassion, be expanded so that the natural limitations of the scope of compassion, seen as rooted in its intentional nature, be overcome. The question for me is that if the eudaimonistic judgment has such an elastic character, how can an expanded range of compassion serve as the basis for a compassion grounded version of forgiveness? The eudaimonistic judgment can expand its range and thereby expand the range of compassion by our cultivating other mental capacities that act to break down various impediments that hamper one portion of humanity from seeing that it shares similar possibili- ties with another portion of humanity. The two chief ways that Nussbaum sees this occurring are, ﬁrst, through overcoming the emotion of disgust, an emotion that separates us from others insofar as it pushes the Other away as different and inferior to me; and, second, by cultivating the mental capacity of imagination, which Nussbaum believes will enable us to understand and feel the pain of those who undergo tragic circumstances who are not in our imme- diate empirical orbit. While Nussbaum spends more time discussing the role of disgust in constricting compassion, I want to focus on the cultivation of the imagination, inasmuch as it is more closely linked with the third Aristotelean requirement of the seeing of similar possibilities. 26 Mercy, Compassion, and Forgiveness 245 Nussbaum has argued that as intentional, emotions, including com- passion, are object-oriented, and thereby fundamentally sensory in provenance. We have compassion most naturally and intensely for what is nearby, for we can immediately see and touch. Expanding this circle outward is most naturally accomplished by the mental capacity that allows us to artiﬁcially create our own reservoir of sensory images, the imagination. Indeed, insofar as compassion is in large part the ability to picture oneself in the position of the other, the mental faculty of imagination appears to be at its heart. Nussbaum’s primary suggestion for how the imagination would assist the eudaimonistic judgment in expanding its orbit to simulate the equality and dignity of all attained by the Stoics at the expense of emotion, is through education. The suggestion is that we should follow Rousseau’s lead in Emile and provide to our children through literature and history “an education in common human weakness and vulnerability.” 27 And that “children should learn to be tragic spectators, and to understand with increasing subtlety and responsiveness the predicaments to which human life is prone.” 28 Let us take Nussbaum at her word that such an education would expand the range of compassion through expanding the range of who is included in our eudaimonistic judgment, and set aside all of the practical problems rooted in “culture wars” with establishing such an education. What would a compassion-grounded forgiveness look like, in contrast to a mercy-based forgiveness and, more importantly, in what ways would such a compassion-based forgiveness be, let us say, more forgiving than a mercy-based forgiveness? I will begin by differentiating a mercy-grounded forgiveness as opposed to a compassion-grounded forgiveness. Nussbaum has made it clear that forgiveness is more at home with mercy, inasmuch as the limited compass of compassion runs a greater risk of generating revenge rather than forgiveness. But it is arguable that mercy- grounded forgiveness is not altogether satisfactory, in that it is not sufﬁciently forgiving. There is a hierarchical role reversal in the act of forgiveness, inasmuch as the aggrieved party now must stand over the wrongdoer who has previously laid him or her low in order to grant forgiveness from above. With its roots in the Nussbaum-reconstructed Stoicism, mercy continues to insist upon the full blameworthiness of 246 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology the wrongdoer, but the mercy giver now stands above the wrongdoer by effectively saying: “Even though you fully deserve to be hurt in order to even the scales of justice, and even though I am capable, either personally or through the arms of institutionalized justice, to do so, I do not need to hurt you in order to even that score. I am above the need to inﬂict vengeance, though it still remains justiﬁed, and hence am no longer in servitude to you.” The key is that mercy remains wedded to a logic of retribution. The guilty one deserves to be punished; it is merely that the wronged one has the power to forego the punishment. Forgiveness on this model follows the old adage “to forgive and forget.” The dynamics of a compassion-grounded forgiveness are subtly but distinctly different. We recall the act of forgiveness in the example given with the second condition for compassion, that while generally the victim must be seen as blameless for compassion to occur, exceptions are allowed for. Guilty parties, too, can be the recipients of compassion, and when compassion is so directed, forgiveness occurs. Thus compassion could be directed toward someone who has com- mitted a wrong but whose character had been shaped in the most dismal and tragic of conditions, especially if the penalty imposed either did not take these mitigating circumstances into account or was far too harsh for the wrong committed. What is different in this compassion-based account of forgiveness is that it has come to pass through the three conditions of compassion being met. The suffering is recognized as severe; it is recognized as disproportionate to the wrongdoing; and, most signiﬁcantly, through the condition of similar circumstances, we recognize that we, too, but for a throw of the socioeconomic dice, could have been in the same condition as the wrongdoer. Furthermore, the eudaimonistic judgment has made the judgment that this person, simply as a fellow member of the human race, matters to me, and that to see an injustice perpetrated is to damage my own eudaimonia. And in all likelihood, it is at least in part my education, which has expanded my imagination by my understanding of what it means to live in tragic circumstances, that has resulted in this inclusion. Unlike mercy-grounded forgiveness, compassion-grounded for- giveness is not based on a hierarchical difference between the one Mercy, Compassion, and Forgiveness 247 giving and the one receiving forgiveness. Rather than granting for- giveness from above, forgiveness is granted from a position of equal- ity, or a leveling of hierarchical differences. I forgive because I compassionately recognize that I, too, but for the luck of chance, could be in a similar position. I forgive because I compassionately recognize that differences between humanity are not as signiﬁcant as the commonalities we share, and that we are, at bottom, members of one human race. Furthermore, rather than forgetting, compassion-based forgiveness remembers. It remembers through ongoing awareness of circum- stances that give rise to unnecessary human tragedy and ongoing attempts to rectify these conditions. VI Hiroshima, Ground Zero: Compassionate Forgiveness Through the Immediacy of Unimagined Suffering THE REALITY OF the city of Hiroshima, what it has experienced and what it has become, represents both a searing refutation of the Stoic position on the limitations of compassion and a vivid instance of what I have described as a forgiveness grounded in compassion. At 8:15 A.M. on August 6, 1945, the citizens of Hiroshima experienced Hell. Never in the history of humanity had so many suffered so deeply in such a compressed timeframe. An atomic ﬂash, seconds in its initial discharge, released upon the citizens of Hiroshima a horror never before imagined. Perhaps the most horriﬁc and compassion-inducing testimonies of the hibakusha, the survivors of the atomic bomb, occur through the medium of drawings and paintings. 29 These are extraordinarily strong, nightmarish paintings that more than speak for themselves. I won’t dilute their power by attempting to interpret or describe them through the less immediate and weaker medium of language. But I will point out that the one recurring image in these collections is that of rows of people walking with both arms extended, arms red with raw exposed ﬂesh, with six- to twelve-inch skeins of gauze-like ﬂesh draping from their arms. They could not lower their arms to a normal position because of the pain felt if their arms accidentally brushed against their bodies. The burns were the 248 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology outcome of people instinctively shielding their eyes from the blast with their forearms or hands, which in turn took the full brunt of the atomic blast. Half dead, half alive, this haunting, horriﬁc, recurrent image has been designated by the survivors of Hiroshima as “the procession of ghosts.” 30 The power of these paintings, occurring through a visual medium, attests to the truthfulness of Nussbaum’s historical account of compassion—that it is the immediate and sensual, rather than the abstract mental, that most forcefully triggers the emotion of compassion. The depth of the wordless compassion felt by the hibakusha was poignantly expressed on the Hiroshima Second Middle School Memo- rial Monument by Sadae Yoshida, former principal at the school. At the site where 352 students and staff were killed, it is written: “As we think of your faces and deeds, there are no words. We can only weep.” 31 If the Stoic’s and Adam Smith’s account of compassion were correct, the compassion felt by the residents of Hiroshima and indeed all of Japan would not be surprising, for never in the history of humanity had a people experienced suffering of this magnitude. Compassion for one’s own, for the sensually accessible close at hand—that is, for the nuclear-scorched dying child in one’s arms—would be a natural occurrence. But if the Stoic account of compassion were correct, then the correlate of this compassion would be a desire for revenge against those who had inﬂicted the suffering. The orbit of compassion would necessarily remain small, extended for the close-at-hand victim, and the underbelly of a deeply felt compassion for the victim—your child, your neighbor, your countryman—would breed hatred and revenge for one who had inﬂicted the suffering. Even if the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the immediate cause of Japan’s surrender in World War II and the subsequent peace, the Stoic would expect that that peace would be deeply ﬂawed, in that a murderous revenge against the United States would fester in the hearts of all the citizens of Japan, and especially the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 32 Unless, of course, the Stoic state of mind had been successfully developed and compas- sion had been eradicated. In the immediate aftermath of the war, it was no doubt frequently the case that the desire for revenge was felt. 33 But over a relatively short period of time, the desire for revenge dissipated, and instead something extraordinary happened, something Mercy, Compassion, and Forgiveness 249 that stands as a striking testimony against the Stoic understanding of compassion. A catharsis occurred, and the city of Hiroshima became a city dedicated to peace, not to revenge. The center of the city is now the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, which houses the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. There is no Revenge Park, and a tour of the Peace Museum, which chronicles the events of August 6, 1945, is not a scathing indictment against the United States, but instead is a sobering indictment against nuclear weapons. On August 6, 1947, two short years after the unleashing of the atomic bomb, Hiroshima held its ﬁrst annual Peace Festival, where every year since 1947 the same statement—the Peace Declaration— ﬁrst read by Mayor Shinzo Hamai, has been read at the Peace Memorial Ceremony. 34 The Peace Declaration includes the following: “This horrible weapon brought about a revolution of thought which has convinced us of the necessity and the value of lasting peace.” 35 It is my humble hope that this paper might shed light upon the meaning of this “revolution in thought,” enunciated every August 6 in Hiroshima. I would suggest that the tragedy experienced by Hiroshi- ma’s residents was so profound that it enabled them to cathartically twist free of the impulse to avenge their suffering, and replace it with a cosmopolitan sentiment that this must never happen again—not just to “us,” thought of as the residents of Japan, but to “us” now understood as the human race as a whole. Suffering was experienced at such a magnitude that vengeance against the United States was largely erased through a forgiveness that imaginatively stretched out to include all of humanity. In Nussbaum’s terminology, the compassion that the people of Hiroshima felt for their own was so deep that their eudaimonistic judgment judged that no one should ever endure the suffering that fell upon them, and that genuine human ﬂourishing could not occur in a world threatened by nuclear annihilation. Com- passion extended its normal parochial range to encompass the entire human race, and all were forgiven, for all, even the perpetrators, were seen as potential victims of nuclear horror. And what the people of Hiroshima have told us—through the testimonies and paintings of the hibakusha, through the yearly enunciation of the statement of peace at the Peace Memorial Cer- emony, through the very existence of the Peace Memorial Park and 250 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology the Peace Memorial Museum—is what a compassion-based forgive- ness would tell us. And that is that while we must forgive, we can never simply “forgive and forget,” as perhaps the highest form of a mercy-based forgiveness would counsel us to do. 36 Rather, continued memory of the tragedy is the obligation that tragedy imposes. For— and Nussbaum would be most sympathetic with this—memory and imaginative reconstruction of the original event are critical steps in lessening the possibility that the tragedy never repeats itself.
