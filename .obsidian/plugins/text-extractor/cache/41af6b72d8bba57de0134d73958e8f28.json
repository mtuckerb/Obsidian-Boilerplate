Writing has been an essential and powerful tool in myprofessional toolbox, and I have been refining my business writing skills withintention for at least twenty years. I enrolled in the Academic Writing classthis semester (Spring 2025) with confidence in my abilities, and found, to myDevelop your body paragraphs by talking about your experiencesas a researcher, writer, remediator, and member of a writing community.Analyze your processes and their context—the topic; challenges; stepsforward or backward, especially revision; and the role of communityfeedback, including your instructor’s.Provide evidence of analysis and critical thinking—not just listing allthe work you did but putting it into perspective and striving to understandyourself better as a researcher, writer, and community member.Thinking about all these experiences, compose an essay thataddresses these questions: What do I now know about researching and writing that I didn’tbefore? How has the exploratory process helped me as a learner in thiscourse? How did I envision and carry out my responsibility for the discoveryprocess?How has belonging to a community contributed to my learning in thiscourse? How do I see the relevance/applicability of the RLE experience infuture courses and possibly beyond?delight that I did in fact have some skill, when measured academically, butalso realized that I had some unlearning to do.Research and writing in the academic context differs from businesswriting in a few key ways. First, in business writing, citations were somewhatoptional, and often frowned upon as clutter. In this semester, in addition tolearning proper MLA citation and formatting, I was also introduced (inanother class) to APA style citations. The tools that I was provided in myAcademic Writing class were timely and effective in preparing me for papersthat I had to write for my other classes. Specifically, I found the introductionto Purdue OWL, and the USM Databases to be invaluable in my SWO-201,and PHI-275 classes, both of which have heavy writing requirements (andrequire APA citations). The introduction of these foundational referencesallowed me to effortlessly adapt to the new citation and formatting styles ofAPA.Secondly, I in business writing, the emphasis is placed on pithy,digestible, and uncluttered communication. I found I achieved maximumimpact by short paragraphs, with ample spacing, and repetition of a centraltheme. Images and charts were important, but generally limited to roughlyone per 500 words or so, direct quotes were rare, as they tended to needexplanation that risked losing your audience. Academic writing, on the otherhand, values completeness and seeks authoritatively prove a thesis, bymaking explicit connections from existing, cited, and contextualized, peer-reviewed knowledge. It was a real challenge to refactor my writing style tothis more verbose and explicit format, but it has paid dividends in all of myclasses. I have received As on every paper I have submitted this semester(save a single B), and I credit a significant percent of that success to what Ihave learned in this class.As I mentioned earlier, I have learned quite a few new tools through thiscourse. In addition to the USM Library Database, I have also been exposedto multimodal research including internet (youtube and media search), fieldresearch, and of course textual sources. I have used similar tools in myprevious career, but this course helped me to increase the effectiveness ofmy research significantly.Unlearning old habits is—in my opinion—harder than simply learningnew ones. The feedback that I received from my peers and professor helpedme to quickly and effectively identify which old habits were still applicable,and which needed to be adjusted for this new context. The peer feedback,especially that of our Learning Assistant Katie, were bolstering andinformative, and the instructor feedback gave me very specific guidance.Because our professor had experience with business and academic writing,she was able to translate my existing style into the new format with kindnessand empathy, which helped me to remain confident and avoided a self-critiquing pitfall that has previously diminished my motivation andenthusiasm for learning.As a student in the School for Social Work, I place a high value oncommunity. I was impressed and surprised to learn, at the beginning of thesemester, that the English department did as well. At the outset, ourprofessor informed us that we would be working collaboratively, with anintention to create community within and beyond the classroom. My initialskepticism quickly evaporated as we began preparing for our field trip, anddespite the fact that I was unable (due to scheduling conflicts) to join my ownclass, I did witness the cohesion that field trip engendered with the class Ijoined. Inside the classroom, our group mentoring helped to furtherstrengthen those bonds, providing a rich sense of belonging and supportthroughout the semester.Reflecting on this semester, I recall entering the class with anexpectation of a tremendous amount of writing with retrospective, concise,dry, instruction. I imagined that I would have to fail before I succeeded, andthat it might be a struggle, despite my strong professional writing skillset. Iwas prepared to be self-sufficient, and had set a \"reasonable\" expectationfor my academic success. The instructor and peer support provided throughthe RLE program has, to the contrary, provided me with a robustcollaborative, and effective learning environment that prepared me for thechallenge of adapting to academic writing, so that I knew how to bridge gapsin knowledge before submitting my papers.The RLE process has clearly demonstrated the value of peer support,community, remediation, rhetorical analysis, and formal and field research. Ilook forward to the possibility of participating in the RLE process in futurecoursework, but regardless, the techniques and attitudes that this processhas exposed me to will inevitably become core to my educational processgoing forward.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
