Course Description This course is offered either as an elective course open to any student exploring an interest in the profession of social work or as a required entry-level foundation course for students already committed to a social work major. Students will be introduced to generalist social work practice as a multi-level and multi-method approach to influencing change in problem situations. Students will also be introduced to the core values and related Code of Ethics for the profession, as well as be exposed to issues of diversity, oppression, and social justice. The practice of generalist social work will be considered from the perspective of a collaborative strengths-based model working within complex social service systems. The course will familiarize students with the various roles, functions, and tasks which social workers perform in a variety of settings, and acquaint students with the primary skills and practices of professional social work. Taking this course will allow students to make a more informed decision about pursuing social work as a career. 1 https://mycampus.maine.edu/group/usm/common-syllabus Prerequisite: None 1B.

Assessment Descrip tions & Req uirements Weekly reflective response (20%) Starting in week 2, students will be pr ovided with an index card each class on which they are asked to write a brief reflection on class content (assigned readings, video, class discussions and activities). This pr ovides the opportunity to earn 2 poin ts for each submission. Students may reflect on what resonated with them, a major area of learning, an unanswered ques tion, an area of confusion etc. Students will submit their index card at the end of class. If students need additional pr ocessing time before submitting their reflection, please let me know. Students are also permit ted to submit their reflection even if they miss the face-to-face class. A fuller descrip tion of the assignment is pr ovided here: Weekly Reflective Response . Multicultural Assessment Paper (30%) Based on the book, The Spirit Catches Y ou and Y ou Fall Down, students will write a paper that pr ovides an in-dep th assessment and applic ation of generalist social work pr actice principles to the case of the Lee family in light of their encounter with the American medical system. We will discuss the story in small group s throughout the semester but you must write your paper individually. See MAP Assignment [SWO 201]- Course Syllabus 5 for details. Social Worker Interview/Volunteerism Presentation (10%) Students choose to either volunteer at a social service site for 10 hours before the end of the semester OR interview a social worker (BSW or MSW) about their pr ofessional experience. Students should indicate their choice by week 3. Regardless of choice, all students will share their experience in an oral pr esentation (no more than 10 minutes) during the final 2 weeks of the semester. The Final Presentation guide offers the details. Analyzing Social Access Paper (20%) This assignment requir es students to visit the Osher Map Library and use available artifacts and resources to write a paper that focuses on social access from both a historical and contempor ary per spectiv e. Students will select artifacts to examine that pr ovide information from the pas t on access to necessities such as medical care, food, affordable housing and education. They will also identify sources that offer information on current available access to the same need. Upon analyzing access to one of these basic needs at two poin ts in time, students will write a 6-8 pag e paper that discusses society’s pr ogress in meeting human needs and the role of social work as a pr ofession in resolving the issue. See more here. Engagement and Participa tion (20%) Active engagement and participa tion is an essential part of your learning experience. Participa tion poin ts for this class will be assigned based on your engagement with content and with your peer s during large and small group class activities. Engagement comes in many forms, and is not merely just attending class. Taken holistically, engagement includes (but is not limited to) the following: · Prepar ation (reviewing readings and material before class) · Focus (avoiding distractions during in-per son and online activities) · Presence (engaged and responsiv e during group activities) · Asking ques tions (in class, out of class, online, offline) · Listening (hearing what others say, and also what they’re not saying) · Specificity (referring to specific ideas from readings and discussions) · Synthesizing (making connections between readings and discussions) Your final engagement and participa tion score will be the average of your instructor-assigned poin ts (10 p ts.) and peer -assigned poin ts from your small group discussion group s (10 p ts.).

Course-Sp ecific Policies 4 A. Attendance and Particip ation Attendance and participa tion are an extremely import ant part of the course. Students should be aware that much of successful social work pr actice centers around the capacity to engage and pr ocess with others comple x and challenging issues in order to learn, deepen understanding, pr oblem solve, and facilitate growth. Our experience together in both large and small group discussions and activities pr ovide opportunities to enact these import ant social work compe tencies. These activities and the discussions we will have are valuable and irreplaceable, and so “showing up” will be critical for individual and corpor ate learning. As a result, please be pr epar ed to be actively engaged, sharing your thoughts and raising ques tions. Participa tion may look different for every student and so there will be varied opportunities to engage in small and large group discussions, written reflections, pr ovide peer support etc. The instructor does take attendance and account for participa tion, as outlined in the Engagement and Participa tion section above. Missing two or more sessions will trigger an academic review and may result in a failing grade for this course. Students are encouraged to openly communicate with me if there are issues impacting your attendance and participa tion. 4 B. Late Work Assignments must be turned in prior to, or on the due date. Extensions may be reques ted before the due date, excep t for emergencies. Late work may be seen as a reflection of a student’s level of pr ofessionalism and may impact the engagement and participa tion score at the end of the semester. 4 C. Class Cancellation In the event of a class cancellation for reasons other than institution-wide closures due to weather or other incidents, an announcement will be sent via the course’s Brightspace pag e. Please ensure that [SWO 201]- Course Syllabus 9 you set up notifications for announcements, and that you check emails in a timely manner. 4 D. Inclement Weather Contingencies In the event of a campus closure due to inclement weather, you can expect that the class will also be canceled. Should this change, you will be notified if it is deemed necessary to meet via Zoom. 4 E. Personal Device Usage in the Classroom Students are able to use a per sonal electronic device for note taking purposes only. In keeping with expect ations regarding pr ofessionalism and engagement, please ensure that you do not use electronic devices for non-class related tasks. 4 F. Use of Artificial Intelligence ( AI) in Coursework I am aware that some students may want to use ChatGPT and similar tools to help generate ideas, brainstorm and more. While I am not entirely against its use, you should note that the material generated by these pr ograms may be inaccurate, incomple te, or otherwise pr oblematic. Beware that use may also stifle your own independen t thinking and creativity. In addition, developing strong writing, analytical, and critical thinking skills are import ant outcomes of this course. You may not submit any work generated by an AI pr ogram as your own. If you include material generated by an AI pr ogram, it should be cited like any other reference material (with due consideration for the quality of the reference, which may be poor). Any plagiarism or other form of cheating will be dealt with according to the University Policies – Community Standards and Mediation (maine.edu). 4 G. Additional Instructor Notes 1. Content on Diverse Popula tions: This course will emphasiz e understanding of the impact of social and economic injustice on the lives of people. Institutional racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, homophobia, classism, ageism, and other oppr essive conditions and their effects will be discussed throughout the course. 2. Teaching/Learning Philosoph y & Methods: The course incorpor ates a wide variety of teaching and learning activities so as to be engaging and responsiv e to student needs and interests. Activities may include lectures by the instructor and guests, case studies, videos, large and small group discussions, and student pr esentations. Students are encouraged to be avid partner s in both the teaching and learning pr ocess, as the course design is built on a philosoph y that emphasiz es democratic relationship s within the classroom (Freire, 1970). In other words, as an instructor, I reject the traditional pr emise of the ‘banking method’ that assumes that the instructor is the sole possessor of knowledge, while the students are emp ty recep tacles into which the instructor deposits knowledge. All students have valuable knowledge and experience, from which they are encouraged to share, so as to contribute to meaningful discussion and debate. Students are also asked to pr ovide feedback on the course structure and format both informally and through formal course evaluations. This is valuable information that can be used to make adjustments to the course outline and calendar as needed. 3. Adherence to the NASW Code of Ethics: It is expect ed that students will abide by the NASW Code of Ethics in all interactions and in assignments. To review the Code of Ethics, see http s://www.socialworkers.org/About/Ethics/Code-of-Ethics 4. Writing quality: The quality of your writing will be taken into consideration in the grading of all [SWO 201]- Course Syllabus 10 written work. Follow APA-7 guidelines and cite sources accordingly. A useful source for APA is APA Formatting and Style Guide (7th Edition) - Purdue OWL® - Purdue University. Professional writing is an import ant skill to refine during this course. Though allowing time for rewriting and polishing your written work may be difficult, the quality of your work may be greatly impr oved if you do so. 5. Incomple tes: An incomple te must be negotiated in advance. The only accep table reason for applying for an incomple te is a serious medical or per sonal emergency that arises within the last two weeks of the semester. Therefore, an Incomple te is only permissible if only a small portion of the coursework remains. 6. Instructor Availability for Assistance & Support: Students are encouraged to contact me at any time throughout the semester to discuss ques tions or concerns. I am available if students would like to ask specific ques tions about course material or assignments, review feedback on graded work, pr ovide suggestions to enhance the learning experience and/or discuss topics related to the course or the social work pr ofession. The pr eferred and most reliable method of communication is email, which I check regularly. If you are sending an email, please remember that while this need not be formal, it is pr ofessional communication (per the CSWE compe tencies, all social work students are expect ed to demonstrate pr ofessional and ethical conduct in all forms of communication). See Email Etique tte for suggestions on how to communicate with instructors. Please note that I may not respond to emails sent after 6 p.m. until the following day, if I am able. You can expect that emails will be responded to within 48 hours. I am also available to speak by phone or meet via Zoom. 5 .
