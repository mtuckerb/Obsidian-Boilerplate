BECKERMAN & PAUL JOHNSON Sum mary Two of the authors of this article were key participants in the planning and implemen- tation of IM PACT 97, an interdisciplinary conference whose aim was the collection and dissemi- nation of data documenting the harm being done by cutbacks in health and social services. IMPACT 97 took place in 1997 in N ew York City. It was partly inspired by an international conference held earlier in Great Britain on the Crisis in the Human Services (Adams, 1997). Both conferences demonstrated that interdisciplinary collaboration was possible, that it could result in the collection and dissemination of key social data and that it could receive the support of practitioners, key organiza- tions as well as funding assistance (Adams, 1997; Beckerman & Levitt, 1997). This article builds on this experience by considering how to defend social and health services under threat. While all sectors of social services have been threatened, social services in health care have experienced some of the greatest challenges. Developments in this ® eld of practice provide the focus for the article. The following questions will be addressed: W hy is the social work profession and its services under attack? What can we do about these attacks? W hat are the forces which shape our future and how can we help shape that future? In presenting this article on the United States’ experience, the intent is to look for parallels which can inspire mutual support in dealing with the increasingly intolerable situation of the social work profession in the United States and Great Britain. Social work under attack Adequacy of funding for health and social services is a variable, not a constant. It is an outcome of the con¯ ict equations which characterize the collisions of class interests and other social forces in society. Regard for the essentiality of social work services is also a variable. If the dominant values in a given society are those which can be described as hum anitarian in nature, then social work services will be regarded as more essential. If, however, the dom inant values are those of market forces seeking to maximize wealth and power, then social work services will be regarded as peripheral and may well be regarded as dysfunctional. W e have become all too familiar with the canard that poverty is caused by poor people abetted by the coddling they receive from social workers. The struggle for dominance between these two value complexes re¯ ects the broader struggles which are swirling in American society today. The interventions which characterize the work of this profession are regarded by some as interfering with health care pro® ts. That is, social work services are said to increase the costs of production thus lowering the pro® ts to be derived from providing health care.

Enter, the m arket The market typical of capitalist society is taking over much of health care in the United States. The economic foundation of health care in which social services were embedded is vanishing. In its place is a rapidly changing non-system typi® ed by chaotic con¯ ict between different organizational elements, mergers to form larger organizations and the formation of national entrepreneurial chains of hospitals. These changes are re¯ ected in the new language being spoken both here and in Great Britain such as `marketization’ and `managerialism’ (Harris, 1997). Patients are `customers’ as well as elements in `pro® t centers’ and woe to the customers who lack the m eans of payment or whose payments are too low to generate pro® ts (Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Health Care, 1997). The num ber of uninsured has increased each year since 1987 (New York Times, 8 Septem ber 1998, p. 1). In 1996, 42 million Americans, a ® gure roughly equivalent to one-sixth of the population, lacked health insurance and thus were limited in their ability to utilize market-based health care. This ® gure of uninsured people was the highest since the passage of M edicaid and M edicare in the mid-1960s (N ational Public Radio, 6 February 1998; Webber, 1998; Woolhandler & Himmelstein, 1998, p. 1). In order to maximize corporate pro® ts, costs of health care enterprises must be contained regardless of the health status, pain and suffering of individuals and families. The United States has had two m arkets in health care for some time. The public market’ s vision is that of the health of all m embers of society. The private market’ s outlook is the provision of health services to all those who pay the cost of these services at a level which generates pro® t for the health enterprise. The two markets interm esh in the United States in publicly ® nanced programs such as M edicaid and M edicare. The outcome of the political con¯ icts between these two markets has resulted in private sector domination of publicly ® nanced programs. Inadequate regulation by the government continues to serve the interests of the private health-care market. The resultant market con® guration has valued the high income incurred on the day of birth of a child. Follow-up care of mother and child which has traditionally followed childbirth has not been pro® table for health care entrepreneurs, hence, m andatory discharge after the ® rst day. In the horror which greeted this exercise of greed by the market, and in the reversal of the arbitrariness of mandatory discharge, lies both the con¯ ict and the hoped for changes in the structure of health care. The W all Street Journal has observed, ª The privatization of America (is beginning) to stir a backlashº (Wessel & Harwood, 1998). There is increasing recognition of the need for a much stronger Patient’ s Bill of Rights and more effective regulation. The inevitable excesses of an industry driven mainly by the hunt for pro® t are creating the basis for reform, an observation re¯ ected in a recent press commentary: ¼ one national issue [is] emerging from the hodgepodge of political campaigns ¼ health insurance. H.M .O.s have taken over and voters don’ t like it ¼ Candidates ¼ are rallying behind legislation ¼ that promises to force H.M .O.’ s to pay for more care, to expand patient choice and to require [them] to document how well they treat patients. (Weinstein, 1998) The dominance of the pro® t motive in the provision of health care is occupying a key position in political debate in the United States. The dominant values re¯ ected in recently enacted welfare reform measures were similar. Poor people were seen as lazy and shiftless, needing `tough love’ to overcome their idleness. Together with the poor, immigrants were looked upon as draining the country of its wealth and were consequently DEFENDIN G SOCIAL AND H EALTH SERVICES 61 deprived of basic necessities of life. Although there are some signs suggesting these dom inant values are shifting, the struggle is far from over. Evidence of the harm caused by the attacks on the social work profession and on health and social services The effects of these attacks include: ¼ the structures which have permitted social workers in hospitals to work together, to support one another, to avoid duplication and to coordinate the education of social work students are being dismembered. Instead, social workers are working more and more in atomistic bureaucratic units, isolated from one another, often supervised by non-social work health care professionals or administrators. Tim e for supervision has become minimal and has become largely focussed on procedures. Job security is being undermined and is becoming based almost exclusively on pro® t and loss statem ents. ¼ in behavioral health care, the discretion of social workers is being sharply curtailed. Insurance companies are dictating the length and type of treatment. Con® dentiality protections form erly afforded clients are being shredded. The most intimate diagnostic information is being demanded by insurance com panies as a condition of reimbursement of services. ¼ health services formerly deemed to be highly signi® cant are being cut so that waiting lists grow and service availability is rationed (Ruben, 1997). What can be done about these attacks? Appreciation of the low power position held by the social work profession need not lead to despair. It can lead to the design of political strategies marked by power multiplication through interdisciplinary collaboration and alliances with other forces. The profession can become involved in this way in the fundamental political con¯ icts which determine the acquisition and allocation of resources for health and social services. In such engagements, social workers will need to become more able to advocate for themselves as well as for their clients. Advocacy is an acquired competence which can be learned in schools of social work and in practice. It is learned poorly in schools of social work which ignore this area of competence in practice classes and limit it to philosophical discussions. It is not learned well in agencies which do not encourage staff to move beyond person into environmental intervention. A step in the right direction is the recent formation of the M ontreal Consortium for Human Rights Training (Social Work with Groups, 1998). Such training enhances the ability of social workers to intervene in oppressive social environm ents on behalf of and with clients. Where do schools of social work ® t in this discussion? Professional schools need to help students acquire the competencies inherent in effective advocacy for clients and self-advocacy. But this is not enough. They need to go beyond advocacy and teach students the skills they will need in market-driven health care settings. These skills include negotiating and bargaining. They include the ability to undertake 62 LOUIS LEVITT ET AL. cost± bene® t analyses and to incorporate the knowledge gained to defend and enhance social work services. The challenge to social work education is to move students beyond the limitations of social work practice in health care settings which were described recently by Dr Jesse Harris: And even while we were providing the best social work interventions ¼ , we were ignorant with respect to issues of cost-bene® t or the enormous ® nancial cost to operate the facility or even our own departments ¼ [we could not com prehend] concerns about outcome m easures. (Harris, 1997, p. 1) Harris goes on to focus on the recomm endations of the Pew Commission for the education of all health professionals emphasizing that ª the next generation of professionals must be prepared to practice in settings that are more intensively managed and integrated and will be required to use sophisticated information and communications technologyº (Harris, 1997, p. 5). Advocating for ourselves Self-advocacy can take on various forms. In states with inadequate licensing statutes, social workers will need to press for the enactment of legislation which will recognize the profession, de® ne its scope of practice and enhance its status. Social work should be formally included in the array of services under government programs such as Medicaid M anaged Care. W e need to develop the ideology and skills and con® dence to negotiate with insurance companies for inclusion on approved provider lists. This will require the assistance of government regulators of the insurance industry, still another reason for increasing the profession’ s ability to exercise political in¯ uence. The need for coalitions and the groundwork for building them However much the social work profession strives to realize these goals, it cannot attain them with its own inadequate strength. In health care, most professionals are working harder and receiving lower rates of remuneration. The job security for every professional is precarious. Clear lines of demarcation between and within disciplines are being blurred. In such situations, social workers can make common cause with other health professionals and the social work profession, qua profession, can seek out and participate in formal coalitions with other professions. Professions are sanctioned by society. Together, that sanction and its resultant standing can be used to bring about a greater recognition of the harm being done by the lack of effective regulation of m arket forces on the quality of national health care. The IMPACT 97 conference demonstrated that interdisciplinary collaboration towards this end was possible. The conference showed that social workers, physicians, nurses, lawyers and other profession- als could work together, could collaborate in research on the harm being done by cutbacks in health and social services and could speak as one. The conference recognized that all of the professions in health care are confronting the same problems and need to seek allies in addressing these problems. Coalitions involving the trade union movement There is a strong force in British and American society which, if focused on the need to DEFENDIN G SOCIAL AND H EALTH SERVICES 63 protect and enhance health and social services, can help turn the tide. Am erican labor has show n renewed vigor and a renew ed social awareness in recent tim es. Unions in N ew York State, led by D istrict 1199, the hospital w orkers union, have united in a cam paign for im proved child care (N ew York Times, 3 February 1998, p. B1). Professional collaboration with the labor m ovem ent can bring enorm ous strength in coalitions to protect health and social services. T he key to the beginning of this collaboration m ay well lie in the hundreds of social w orkers who are m em bers of trade unions. Trade union support coupled with increased political involvem ent by collaborating hum an service professions is key to acquisition of the enhanced political pow er needed for substantive health care reform s. T rade unions in the U nited States are m anifesting increased econom ic strength. Recent successful strikes by the U nited Autom obile W orkers against General M otors and the com m unication w orker’ s union against Bell Atlantic have resulted in signi® cant labor victories. Harnessing that strength is essential to protect and enhance health and social services. Trade union involvem ent in health care issues will increasingly be seen as a key issue in collective bargaining. The con¯ ict will center on the cost-shifting now going on in which the employer share of private health care prem iums has fallen each year since 1992. During this time, employee contributions have risen more sharply than employer contributions to health care premiums (Woolhandler & Himmelstein, 1998, p. 12). This is an important issue both in and beyond the trade union movement. Political responsiveness to groups who ordinarily do not exercise much political in¯ uence increases as election times approach and recedes after such occasions. Preparation for elections can involve creation of coalitions to protect and enhance health and social services and force the political structure to become more responsive to such claims. Questions and strategies for the future W e need to learn to understand the dynam ics of the m arket in health care and to work effectively within its chaotic and changing structures. Alert to the dangers posed by ª idolatry of the m arketº (Bennett, 1998), w e can do this withou t being coopted. W e need to help social w ork practitioners to know m ore about `case m anagem ent’ and how to deal w ith w hat they perceive as contradictions betw een the standards of social w ork practice and changing patterns of w ork. W e need to be able to produce studies which dem onstrate the effectiveness of our w ork (Reynolds, 1997). W e can engage m ore effec- tively in the real-world con¯ icts w hich characterize health and social services if we know how to calculate the costs of our services and quantify their bene® ts. N o one w ill do this for us. Competence in community outreach can be acquired. We need to work together with community groups to plan for needed services together and, in this way, secure their endorsement and support. In this way, we can create a market for services through means which are much more effective than the impersonal communications typical of commercial markets. The Pew Commission recommended an increased focus on local community health needs. They recognized the growing trend to relocate health care in the neighborhoods (Harris, 1997, p. 5). Social workers skilled in community work can make a great contribution to health care organizations moving in this direction. Social workers have demonstrated that focused application of social work services can reduce costs by anticipating the needs of particular groups of hospital patients and commenc- 64 LOUIS LEVITT ET AL. ing discharge planning services for this population prior to actual admission (Rock et al., 1997). W e can show that the use of social workers in emergency rooms produces greater patient and family cooperation which increases incom e-producin g treatment time of doctors and nurses and increases the ef® ciency of the total unit (Garces, 1998). M edicaid Managed Care is now the trend in New York State with respect to health services for the poor. A large number of individuals and families who face continuing crises in their lives due to their lack of income have been `pushed’ into health maintenance organizations. An adequate com plement of social workers is necessary for this new development to succeed. Will government insist on their inclusion in the staf® ng? W ill the pro® t-driven HM Os recognize that their best interests lie in the inclusion of such personnel or will these HM Os abandon M edicaid clients because government reimbursement rates do not provide them with high enough pro® ts? The abandonment process is apparently underway. The largest health maintenance organi- zations in the United States are ª quitting managed care programs for the poor and elderlyº . This retreat is most evident in M edicaid programs. The reasons given for cutting health care for the poor and the elderly are losses in operation and cuts in government payments (New York Times, 7 June 1998, p. 1). A united social work profession in New York State has organized a ª Coalition on the Future of Social Work in Health Careº . Its purposes include assurance that ª comprehensive health and mental health plans include the provision of social work services to meet psycho-social needsº (Health Care and Policy Network, 1997). This is an important step in the right direction. It is becoming evident that m arket-driven health care providers have underestimated their costs and overestimated their ability to make money. As is the case with the Oxford Health Plan in New York City, the rates being charged to their consumers are going to go up at the same time as more service restrictions are being introduced (New York Times, 2 M arch 1998). We can expect declining coverage, rising premiums and increasing inequality in the avail- ability and provision of health care services (Woolhandler & Himmelstein, 1998, p. vi). W e believe that these developments may make possible the advent of new allies among middle- class groups who will be harmed. At the same time, some state governments have agreed to halt the erosion of health care bene® ts. In the United States, we have recently expanded health services to poor children. In New York State, the 1998 session of the State Legislature enacted signi® cant improvem ents to the bene® ts, eligibility and operation of the existing child health program and children’ s M edicaid (Robinson, M emorandum, 24 June 1998). Will the directions now shift to ® rmer government support for the quality of health care services? There is only one thing certain about these futuristic scenarios. They all require an increase in the involvement of the social work profession in political struggle to defend itself and the services in which it is engaged. They will require greater interdisciplinary collaboration which seeks more effective government regulation of the health care market. Some progress is being made. For example, the Childrens Mental Health Action Network in New York State designated the week of 16 M arch 1998 as Advocacy W eek. Their members visited legislators in their of® ces ª to talk about children’ s mental healthº and secure their support for ª accessible, quality, family and child centered mental health services for childrenº (Robinson, 1998). Control over the provision of health care by m arket-driven forces can be counted upon to produce serious dif® culties for consumers of these services and for third-party funders such as governm ent and employers. In the process, practices will continue to emerge which an DEFENDIN G SOCIAL AND H EALTH SERVICES 65 aroused public will ® nd cruel and intolerable. Access to needed care, for instance, has been found to have declined signi® cantly between 1994 and 1997 (Woolhandler & Himmelstein, 1998, p. 14). It is becoming increasingly clear that the increased costs and reduced services are due in part to the new class of health care entrepreneurs. A recent estimate of the obscenely large annual payments made to the ten highest paid executives of investor-owned managed care companies totals over $324 million (Modern Health Care, 6 April 1998). The key political question will be the extent to which the resources allocated for the health care of the American people are being siphoned off to satisfy private greed and to pay for the huge administrative costs of the insurance industry. A recent estimate of the overhead costs of the US insurance industry indicates a consumption of health care resources amounting to $46 billion annually (Levit et al., 1996). One way to contain the costs of managed care in the public sector would be the enactment of a government-imposed cap on all centralized costs ª including pro® ts or retained earnings, executive salaries, risk reserve fees and director’ s feesº (Felty & Jones, 1998). Using a regulatory precedent im posed by the State of Pennsylvania, the authors of this proposal de® ned a reasonable limit as 11% of such costs. They feared that managed care in the public sector would not produce ª quality care at reduced costº unless such a limitation was im posed. In order to support such proposals, social workers need to be able to document the irrationalities, cruelties and ineffectiveness of the m arket-driven health care system and share their insights with a growingly alarmed public. In this way the pace of reform can be quickened. The fundamental irrationality of the US health care system can be seen in these observa- tions by W oolhandler and Himmelstein: . 1 3 of patients are inadequately insured . They are often denied care . They are sicker and die younger (while at the same time there is a surplus in the health care system which is indicated by:) . 300,000 empty hospital beds . A growing surplus of physicians . M illions of unnecessary operations W e need to be able to collaborate in research which answers these basic questions at the root of health policy: ª who receives services for how long, from whom, and with what expected outcomesº (Wulczyn, 1998). Conclusion The scenarios which envision an enhanced role for social work in health care all require an increase in sophisticated knowledge about the workings of the market and a greater ability on the part of the profession to participate in that market as a forceful player. They require a reorientation of social work education to help students acquire additional competencies in related practice and research. They require the emergence of the social work profession as an im portant force in efforts to reform health care to achieve universal access, a uniform payment system, effective controls over expenditures (GAO, Report, 1991), and a more humane system of care which regards the needs of people as more important than the need for pro® ts. The outcome of these scenarios will depend on the developm ent of a political orientation by the health care professions which recognizes the need to organize interdisci- 66 LOUIS LEVITT ET AL. plinary coalitions which share in the struggle to protect and enhance health and social services. W e cannot predict the outcome of such efforts. What we can predict is that the lack of such struggle can reduce our professional stature, encourage the transfer of some of the scant resources still being allocated for our services and hurt the vulnerable populations which desperately need our help. That is an intolerable consequence of an unregulated market- driven health care system both for the social work profession and the people who need our help.
