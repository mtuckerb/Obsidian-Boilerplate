One Man Is Trying to Find Out Why. After more than 100 unsuccessfuliob applications, Derek Mobley sued software firm Workdayfor discrimination, claiming its algorithm screened him out By Laaren Weberl Photogaphs by Angela Owens/WS\"I )un22,2025 08:00 p.m. ET U.S. job hunters submit millions of online applications every year. Oftan they get an automatic rejection or no response at all, never knowrng if they got a fair shake from the algorithms that gatekeep today's job market. One workeE Derek Mobley, is trying to discover why. Mobley, an IT professional in North CarohnA applied for more than 100 jobs during a stetch of unemployment from 2017 to 2019 and for a few years after. He was met with rejection or silence each time. Sometimes the rejection emails alrived in the middle of the rught or within an hour of submitting his application. Mobley, now 50 years old, noticed that many of the companies he applied to used an onhne recruiting platrorm created by software firm Workday. The plaforms, called applicant tracking systems, help employers track and screen job candidates. 1n2023 Mobley zuedWorkday, one of the largestpurveyors of recruiting softrrare, for discriminatiorq claiming its algorithm screened him out, based on his age,race and disabilities. Mobley, a Black graduate of Morehouse College who suffers from anxiety and depression, said the math didn't add up. He says he applied only for jobs he believed he was qualified for. \"There's a standard bell cr.rve in statistics. [t didn't make sense that my failure rate was l00yo,\" said Mobley, who has since gotten hired and nvice promoted at Allstate. His surt is now emerging as the most significant challenge yet to the softrrare behind nearly every hiring decision these days. Last month-after several failed challenges by Workday-a federal judge in California said Mobley's age-discrirm.ination clairn could proceed. for now, as a collective action. The ruling opens the door to millions of potential claims from job seekers over the age of 40. While the judge has ruled that Workday didn't intentionally discriminate against Mobley, she left open the door for him to prove ttrat Workday's technology still had the effect of penalizrng him because of his age. She hasn't addressed the race and disability claims. Mobley stilt has a tough case to prove, and the suit may go through years of legal wrangling. Yet the case could force Workday to part the curtains on how its algorithm scores applications, a process that has remained a black box since job searches began moving onhne decades ago. *Hiring intermediaries have pretty much been excused from regulation and they've escaped any legal scrutiny. I think this case will change tha!\" sard Ifeoma Ajunw4 a professor at Emory University School of Law and author of \"The Quartified Worker.\" Workday says Mobley's claims have no merit. It said its softrrare matches keywords on resumds with the job qualifications that its employer-customers load for each role, then scores applicants as a strong, goo4 fair or low match. While employer clients can set up \"knockor:t questions\" that lead to automatic rejections-for example, askrng if a person has legal authorization to work in the U.S. or is available for weekend shifts-the softrrare is designed so employers make the final decisions on candidates who make rt through the initial screen, Workday argued in court filings. \"There's no evidence that the technology results in hann to protected groups,\" the company said. A rocky caneer path Before his job search, Mobley's career path hadn't been smooth. He was laid offin the recession that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and agarn after the housing meltdown in 2008. After that, he left frnance and transitioned to what he viewed as a more recession-proof career in technology, earning an associate degree in nenryork syste,m administration. Still, steady jobs were hard to come by. He spent ayear as a confractor at IT firm HPE, hoping the stint would turn rnto a permanent position. Mobley said he was let go, and he later joined a lawzuit against HPE alleging age and race discrimination. The case was settled in 2020. HPE declined to comment. That job loss led to two years of trnemployment, starting ln'2017 . He applied to more than 100 jobs and found himself on Workday's recruiting plaform over and over. He di&r't get a single interview, let alone a job. Soon, Mobley felt he discerned a pattern. \"It dawned on me that this mtrst be some kind of serv€r reviewing these applications and turning me down.\" He worried that hiring softrryare screened him out because it picked up on his age and race through details on his rdsum6 or that it detected his anxiety and depression through personality tests he took as part of some job applications. The fiustrations of the job search weighed on his emotional health credit and retirement savings, he said. He stayed afloat by driving for uber and working short-term jobs. Mobley eventually did frnd a job, the old-fashioned way. ln2Ol9, he said a recruiter for Allstate called him. A phone screen led to an interview with a hiring manag€r and then an offer. He is now a catastrophe controller, managing the workflow of customers'property and auto darnage claims. Mobley said he suspects Workday's softurare flagged his profile, essentially blackballing him across its entire system, regardless of which company he applied to. Workday disputes that idea, and HR technology experts are skeptical of the theory. Employers customize recruiting softrrare with their own criteri4 they say, creating closed systems that shouldn't theoretically speak to each other. But there is evidence that underlying scoring atgorithms can shut out certain job seekers, said Kathleen Creel, a computer scientist at Northeastern University who has been following the Workday case. That might happen, she said, through mechanical errors such as misclassifuing a previous job title, or by incorporating more complicated algorithmic mistakes that pernlize members of a single goup or people with certain combrnations of characteristics. Such scoring systems can disadvantage qualified workers, according to researchers at Harvard Business School, who have found ttrat ttre systems effectively scr@n out millions of workers by scoring them low for all kinds of reasons, such as having gaps in their r6sum6s or not matching every qualification listed on a lengthy job description. The researchers didn't test for illegal discrimination, such as discrimination based on age, gender or race. Srnce 2022, Workday has built a team focused on ensuring its products meet ethical artificial- intelligence standards. \"Our customers want to know, can I tnrst these technologies? How were they developed?\" Kelly Trindel, who leads the ethrcal AI tearn, said at a conference this month at New York University Law School. Still, the company has fought some efforts to regtrlate automated hiring tools. ln2023, a New York City law went into efrect requring employers that use technology like chatbot interviewing tools and resume scanners to audit them annually for potential race and gender bias, and then publish the results on their websites. When the bill was proposed, Workday argued to loosen some of the rules. If Mobley succeeds, softnare companies and their customers may be required to do more due diligence and disclosure to ensure they don't enshrine bias. Employmant lawyers say any finding of liability could open the door to job seekers also suing employers who use them. \"This isn't a personal vendetta,\" Mobley said. \"I'm an honest law-abiding person trying to just get a job in an honest way.\" Write to LaurenWeber at Lauren.Weber@wsj.com","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
