The shore zone is an attractive area for development and infrastructure on the one hand, and recreation and protection of biological diversity on the other. The Norwegian Planning and Building Act contains a general ban on any building in the area between the ordinary high water mark and up to 100 m inland from the shoreline. Exemptions can be granted, however, by the competent municipality through land planning and individual decisions. The importance attached to leaving the shore zone untouched varies from region to region. There are large geographical differences in terms of biodiversity, cultural heritage, landscape, development, development pressure, migration and depopulation, and commercial activity, as well as public access to the coastal areas and the ocean. Since 2011, the entire Norwegian shore zone became subject to guidelines that regulate a geographical differentiation of management and a more severe protection of central areas. This article analyses key aspects of the Norwegian shore zone regulation. Keywords: coastal zone management; shore zone; municipal planning; central government guidelines; local self-government; judicial review 1. Introduction In this article, we will analyse the legal framework for shore zone management in Norway. The Norwegian Planning and Building Act (PBA), Act no. 71 of 27 June 2008, relating to planning and the processing of building applications stipulates national prioritisations and frameworks for management of the Norwegian coastal zone. In Section 1 – 8 of the Act, second paragraph, a general ban on the execution of any projects “closer to the sea than 100m from the shoreline”, now addressed as the shore zone, is stated. This statute is a focal point in the Norwegian shore zone protection. Nonetheless, municipalities are del- egated key tasks in land-use management. The primary tool for all land-use management is the municipal land-use plans pursuant to PBA. These municipal plans determine future land use and have legal effect for citizens and developers promoting new development projects. Municipal land-use plans can set # 2014 Taylor & Francis ∗Corresponding author. Email: sigrid.schytz@jur.uib.no †The article was written jointly by the authors.

Myklebust (2010, pp. 154 –155). The use of individual decisions is also of signiﬁcant rel- evance for the balance between development and protection. Even if the municipal plan is in accordance with the general building ban, the Act allows the municipal ofﬁcials to grant exemptions from ﬁxed provisions in a land-use plan. The pressure to further develop the shore zone along Oslo Fjord has been substantial. Because of this, the central government’s guidelines for planning in this region were implemented in a Royal decree of 9 July 1993. Despite the general ban, there has been an unfortunate tendency to encroach shore areas in parts of the country. This situ- ation is partly due to too many dispensations being made to permit new buildings to be constructed, and periodic approvals of up to 75% of the applications for exemptions from the shore protection regulation; cf. Doc. nr. 3:7 (2001 – 2002), p. 29. This has resulted in a need for increased government control. As of March 2011, new guidelines applying to the shore zone along the entire coast have been issued, called “central gov- ernment planning guidelines for differentiated management of the shore zone”, adopted by the Royal decree of 25 March 2011, and hereafter referred to as the shore zone guidelines. The Norwegian shore zone guidelines have been adopted as “central government planning guidelines” pursuant to Section 6– 2 of PBA, which stipulates that the guide- lines shall apply for planning and individual decisions pursuant to the Act. They address the public administration. The guidelines establish three categories of provisions for the management of the shore zone, based on a geographic division of the country. The pla- cement of municipalities into the three categories is grounded on a complex assessment of the degree of pressure to develop in the area in question. Considerations such as the distance to major cities, existing development of the coastal zone and population and migration, have been involved in the assessment. Amendments of the categories can be made in cases where development projections have changed or new data are acquired. In this article, we will discuss how the existing regulation balances utilisation and pro- tection of the shore zone. Two dimensions are of particular interest: First, we will analyse the division of competence to administrate the shore zone shared between the government and local self-government agencies (municipalities). In Norway, this problem is of particu- lar, current interest because the new government, beginning in 2013, has had plans to del- egate increased responsibility for planning and building activity and nature conservation to the municipalities and second, we will analyse, the “interference” by the courts through judicial review: What is politics and what is law in shore zone management? Does shore zone protection have a core that neither the central government nor the municipalities can intervene without changing the law? In Section 2, we will provide an overview of Scandinavian legislation that forms the basis for the analysis of the particular Norwegian legislation. Statutory Norwegian coastal zone management follows in Section 3, before we examine more closely, in Section 4, the new guidelines that differentiate management. In this section, we will explore the different measures the government guidelines provide, and the effect of the shore zone guidelines with respect to government control of land-use prioritisation. In Section 5, we discuss the effect of the guidelines on judicial review, regarding both admin- istrative procedures and municipalities’ speciﬁc assessments in cases of dispensations made to the general ban on shore zone building. The important question is to what extent the courts will interfere with professional and political considerations. 190 S.E. Schu¨tz and I.E. Myklebust 2. Scandinavian outlooks The value of outdoor recreation through access to the shore zone is extremely important in many European countries, cf. Reusch (2012, pp. 60– 87). In several countries, the shore zone is also designated as an area that ought to be specially protected because of rich ﬂora and fauna. There may be a need for special rules for environmental management, and all Scandinavian countries have some different kinds of coastal zone regulations on nature conservation and land-use planning. A common denominator in the land-use discus- sions is development versus conservation. To put Norwegian regulation into perspective, Denmark and Sweden are of particular interest. These countries are relatively similar with regard to their geography (extensive coastal zones), laws and management systems. As in Norway, the management of the shore zone is based on municipal land-use planning. State control of local administration is nevertheless expressed in different ways in the various Scandinavian countries’ laws. Denmark, for example, has differentiated the shore zone protection in densely populated areas from areas with holiday homes and other areas regulated directly pursuant to the Pro- tection of Nature Act (PNA) no. 9 of 3 January 1992, Section 69 a). In Scandinavia, there are long traditions of restriction on use along the shore zone. The oldest traditions are found in Denmark, where there have been rules of law governing general right of access to the shore zone since 1917. In Denmark, there have been rules concerning a prohibition against measures in the 100-m belt, since 1937, and from 1995 a belt of 300 m, pursuant to PNA, Sections 15 and 69 a), Sub-section 3. One of the objectives also of the Danish Planning Act of 6 June 1991 nr. 388 is to ensure that “the open coasts” shall continue to be an “essential natural and landscape resource”, cf. Section 1, Sub-section 2, Paragraph 3. This applies to planning in the coastal area, cf. Section 5a, Sub-section 1. There it is stated that “[t]he country’s coastal areas shall be kept as free as possible of development and installations that do not need to be located near the coastline.” In addition, there is a special limit in Denmark on planning within a zone extending in for a full 3 km along the shore zone. With regard to the coast zone planning, the state has a special responsibility, cf. Section 5a, Sub-section 2. Pursuant to Section 11a, Sub-section 18, the municipalities have an obli- gation to draw up guidelines for land use in the zone in the vicinity of the coast in the municipal master plan. Thus, the Danish Planning Act appears to specify clear priorities with regard to the planning of the shore area, which is subject to a prohibition against build- ing. See more about this in, e.g. Anker, in Basse (ed.) (2006, pp. 175 – 335 and p. 180). In Sweden, the general right of access is laid down in the constitution in Chapter 2, Section 18 of the Instrument of Government (1974, p. 152). The right of access to the shore zone is especially strong, cf. The Environmental Code (1998, p. 808) (EC), part two, Chapter 7, Section 15, cf. Sections 13 and 14. The prohibition on building was ﬁrst justiﬁed by the general right of access, but since 1994 it has also been justiﬁed by the con- sideration of preserving natural diversity, cf. A˚ hman in A˚ hman (ed.) (2012, pp. 11 – 17; Michanek and Zetterberg, 2012, p. 215). The shore zone is enforced both 100 m inland and also 100 m out into the sea. Just as in Denmark, the shore zone may be extended to 300 m in certain areas of the shore, cf. Chapter 7, Section 14 of EC. As in Norway, the rules concerning exemptions from the prohibition against building apply, but in Sweden it is the County Administrative Board that has this expertise, cf. Chapter 7, Section 18 of EC. However, through the amendment of 2009, the municipalities were given competence to waive the prohibition against building, among other things, through a detailed plan, cf. The Swedish PBA (2010, p. 900), Chapter 4, Section 17. Thus, through land-use planning, Local Environment 191 the municipalities are involved in differentiating the shore zone protection. See more about this in Bengtsson (2009, pp. 24– 29). 3. Statutory coastal zone management Returning to the Norwegian PBA, it stipulates, dating back to law of 25 June 1965 nr. 5, a general ban on building in the 100-m belt along the shore, today expressed in PBA (2008) cf. Section 1 – 8. The ﬁrst, second and third paragraphs read as follows: In the 100-meter belt along the seashore and river systems, special consideration shall be given to the natural and cultural environment, outdoor recreation, landscape and other elements of public interest. Projects pursuant to Section 1– 6, ﬁrst paragraph, other than alterations to the exterior of a building may not be implemented closer to the sea than 100 metres from the shoreline measured in a horizontal plane at ordinary high tide. The prohibition pursuant to the second paragraph applies insofar as no other building limit has been determined in the land-use element of the municipal master plan or the zoning plan ... According to the third paragraph, the ban on building (the prohibition) can be set aside in a municipal land-use plan by changing the 100 m building limit, creating a new so-called “functional” shore zone. The building limit can naturally be set wider than 100 m, through the competence granted the municipality to determine whether an area should be designated for outdoors recreation, etc. More importantly, the third paragraph statement grants the municipality competence to set the border narrower than the statutory rule. This line can also be drawn directly along the shore line, so that the building ban is set aside completely, see more in Innjord (2010, pp. 30– 33) and Pedersen (2010, pp. 375 –377). In principle, municipalities can choose what types of land use should occur, both at the municipal master planning level and through more thorough zoning plans, as to whether an area should be designated for outdoors recreation, holiday homes, retail, industry, etc. This is an essential task of local self-government. Municipalities are required to have a municipal master plan that encompasses all the land, and they also prepare separate plans for parts of the district, such as the coastal zone. Coastal zone management depends on a contextual view of a larger area, and the municipal master plan for this reason, is the vital management tool in most cases. The zoning plan is designed in more detail and covers smaller areas. The zoning plan aims at describing the more detailed land-use prioritisations in the coastal zone through a public process with broad-based participation. The municipal government (the council) normally makes the ﬁnal decisions on both the municipal master plan and zoning plan, cf. Sections 11 – 15 and 12– 12 of the PBA. In Norway, the municipalities can also make provisions for building in the shore zone by granting dispensation from the building ban pursuant to Section 1 – 8 in PBA, and any restrictions on building in accordance with a local land-use plan, cf. Section 19– 2 of the PBA. The conditions that apply for dispensation, and the legal frameworks that apply to the decision in such cases, are thus key issues with respect to building in the 100-m belt. One condition for exemptions is that the intentions behind the provisions for which the exemption is granted and the intentions in the object clause of the Act must not be “signiﬁ- cantly disregarded”, cf. Section 19– 2, second paragraph. The intentions behind Section 1 – 8 are stated in the ﬁrst paragraph, and concerns environment, outdoor recreation, landscape, 192 S.E. Schu¨tz and I.E. Myklebust etc. The intentions behind a building ban in a local plan, creating a wider functional shore zone, must be found in the preparatory documents for the plan. In PBA Section 19– 2, it is also stated that in order to grant dispensations, the advan- tages must clearly outweigh the disadvantages. For building in the 100-m belt, dispensa- tions may be granted only if the intentions behind the building ban are not signiﬁcantly violated, and additionally the majority of considerations must support granting permission for development. In cases where the natural environment may be affected by an dispensa- tion, an assessment must be made in the light of the principles in Chapter 2 of the Nature Diversity Act, Act no. 100 of 19 June (2009). These principles put forth conditions for con- ducting an assessment that would ensure the use of environmentally sound techniques, the precautionary principle, the principle of cumulative environmental effects (ecosystem approach) and the user-pays principle. The principles serve as guidelines for the exercise of public authority, cf. Section 7 of the Act. See, for example, Backer (2012, p. 233) and Bugge (2011, pp. 228 –229). Even if the municipality in principle is free to determine what an area should be desig- nated for in the municipal master plan and zoning plan, important provisions are stipulated in the PBA. Section 1 – 8 ﬁrst paragraph expressly states what special considerations should be made when considering whether to facilitate new projects along the seashore and river systems. The considerations are relevant to the preparation of local plans and dispensations. Pursuant to the paragraph, special consideration shall be given to the natural and cultural environment, outdoor recreation, landscape and other elements of public interest. Accord- ing to the intentions of the Act, building should be avoided in shore zones where many com- peting interests are represented in order to safeguard the public interests, cf. Ot.prp. nr. 32 (2007 – 2008), p. 174. The aim is to leave the shoreline areas essentially untouched, cf. Ot.prp. nr. 56 (1984 – 1985), p. 101. The competition for land in the shore zone may lead to major conﬂicts of interests, both between public and private actors, various sectorial public authorities, and municipal, regional and central government levels. One aim of land-use planning, as expressed in Section 1 – 1, ﬁrst paragraph of the PBA, is to ensure “coordination” of central government and regional and municipal functions. The planning and building authorities shall seek cooperation with other public authorities with interests in the plan, and shall collect con- sultative statements of the authorities concerned. This coordination is done speciﬁcally through consultative processes and formal “objections”. The county, a neighbouring municipality or affected national expert authorities have the competence to “object” to the local plan. These authorities may make objections to the municipal master plan and the zoning plan in issues that are of national or signiﬁcant regional importance, or which, for other reasons, are of signiﬁcant importance to the sphere of responsibility of the body in question, cf. Section 5 – 4, ﬁrst paragraph. Unless the municipality has taken the objections into account, the contested part of the plan shall be sent to the Ministry for approval, see Section 11 – 6, second paragraph: “The Min- istry decides whether the objections shall be upheld and may in that connection make such alterations to the land-use element of the municipal master plan as it deems necessary.” In practice, consultative statements from central government and regional agencies in connec- tion with planning processes will be of key importance in an attempt to safeguard the more national interests. This option to ﬁle an objection could also lead to more informal “nego- tiations” on the content of the plan. Besides consultative processes and formal objections, the right to appeal has the poten- tial to interfere with the division of competence between the national and local authorities. The Public Administration Act (PAA), Act of 10 February 1967, states a general right for a Local Environment 193 party or another person having a legal interest to appeal individual decisions, such as zoning plans or given dispensations, cf. Section 28, ﬁrst paragraph. In the PBA, this right to appeal is not only a right to which private parties are entitled, but also any central government body affected, cf. PBA Section 1 –9, third paragraph. The agency may appeal against individual decisions if the decision directly affects the sphere of responsibility of the authority con- cerned, unless the authority has been given the opportunity to ﬁle a formal objection. The appeal is decided by the immediately superior instance of the administrative agency. The appellate instance may try all aspects of the case, with one important clariﬁcation: If a state body is the appellate instance for a decision made by a municipality or county muni- cipality, the appellate instance shall attach due importance to the interests of local self-gov- ernment when trying discretionary issues, cf. PAA, Section 34. This leads to the question: What is the scope of local self-government in shore zone management? 4. The Shore zone guidelines 4.1. Introduction The aim of the shore zone guidelines is to “clarify a national land-use policy in the 100- metre belt”, as stated in Section 1, ﬁrst paragraph of the guidelines. In the following, we will examine in what way, or by which instruments, the guidelines fulﬁl this aim to clarify the division of competence between the Government and the local self-government. The shore zone policy is differentiated based on a division of the 428 Norwegian muni- cipalities into three categories. Category 1 stipulates strict shore zone protection, Category 2 medium level of protection, while Category 3 provides for a more ﬂexible, or municipally controlled, protection. The category in which the individual municipalities are placed is based on an assessment, where factors such as distance to major cities, development of the coastline, population and migration have been taken into consideration, cf. Section 4.1 in the guidelines. The “coastal municipalities in the Oslo Fjord region” (Category 1) experience the greatest development pressure. When reference is made to Category 1, it is indicated as an area of greatest development pressure, see Chapter 5 of the guidelines for further details. “Other areas where there is high pressure on the land” (Category 2) encompass parts of the coast in Southern Norway (i.e. up to and including Trøndelag), see Chapter 6. This is an area where pressure on land is high, but somewhat less than in the municipa- lities of the Oslo Fjord region. The remaining areas are given less strict protection because the areas are not under pressure, and depopulation to a larger extent requires the safeguard- ing of commercial interests. Such areas “with less pressure on the land” (Category 3) apply primarily to municipalities in the northern part of the country, and also some in the western part, see Chapter 7. How protected is the 100-m belt for the three area categories, or in other words, how strict is the building ban in the area? An underlying question is whether the guidelines clarify the national shore zone policy, creating more predictability for the local authorities in deﬁning the leeway of shore zone management at the municipal level. First, we will examine the guidelines prescription of where in the country, and under what conditions, municipalities can permit building in the shore zone and thus deviate from the general building ban, cf. Section 4.2. Next, we wish to explore whether the guidelines also establish differentiated provisions for the administrative procedural requirements as conditions for building, cf. Section 4.3. In Section 4.4, we will take a closer look to ascertain whether there are also differentiated criteria for municipalities placed in Categories 1, 2 and 3, 194 S.E. Schu¨tz and I.E. Myklebust respectively, when a dispensation from the 100-m belt rule is being considered. Finally, in Section 4.5, we assess the effect of the guidelines regarding government control over muni- cipality shore zone management. 4.2. Development versus conservation: Where can building take place and what can be built? The key point of the shore zone guidelines is to clarify where in the country, and under what prerequisites or conditions, building in the shore zone may be permitted. From another per- spective, this is a clariﬁcation of the areas subject to strong protection against development. We ﬁnd the clearest and strictest guidelines in Category 1 around the capital city – the Oslo Fjord region. Here the guidelines make reference to the building ban in Section 1 – 8 of the PBA and the fact that this applies in general and should be “practiced strictly”. For plan- ning and individual decisions in the shore zone, special consideration shall be given in prin- ciple, to the natural and cultural environments, recreational use, landscapes and other public interests. In the Oslo Fjord region, the guidelines elaborate on the importance of the public interests. In this area, building and encroachment on the landscape is not permitted in areas important for other purposes, such as recreation, nature conservation, biodiversity, cultural heritage, landscape, agriculture, ﬁsheries, aquaculture or other elements important to society. The condition for permitting building is that the area is not of “importance to” the aforementioned purposes, and thus very strict. That being said, the wording of the guidelines is undoubtedly vague, with leeway for interpretation. In Category 2, which encompasses other areas where the pressure to develop the area is high, the building ban, as a main rule, should be strictly practised for “central areas where there is high pressure on the land”. While the requirement for Category 1 states that building and encroachments on the landscape must not be permitted in areas that are of importance to other purposes, this is somewhat more lenient in Category 2, where such encroachments merely should be avoided. A somewhat different approach to the problem of development versus conservation applies to Category 3. In this category, there is nothing that expresses that the building ban in the shore zone should be practised strictly as a rule. The basis for this is that muni- cipalities should only permit building after having conducted a speciﬁc evaluation based on local conditions. Essentially, the guidelines for Category 3 stipulate the obvious, namely that the question of whether to build should be assessed in relation to other public interests. Development should not be permitted in areas of special value to recreation, nature conser- vation, biodiversity and other considerations listed in Section 1 – 8, ﬁrst paragraph of the PBA. In this category, it is also expressed that the need for protection must be measured against considerations for agriculture, ﬁsheries, ﬁsh farming and reindeer husbandry. The guidelines stipulate different requirements for ensuring a functional shore zone in the three categories of shoreline areas. Ensuring a large functional shore zone is a strict requirement in Category 1, a recommendation in Category 2, and in areas with less pressure on the land it is given a more ﬂexible requirement to evaluate whether and, possibly, how large or small the functional shore zone should be. In addition to guidelines pertaining to the speciﬁc areas in which development can be permitted, do the guidelines create more predictability as to what can be built? A suitable example is holiday homes. For the areas around the Oslo Fjord region, the guidelines state that there should be a very restrictive policy with regard to new holiday homes and to any signiﬁcant expansion of existing holiday homes. The formulation for Category 2 is that the policy should be restrictive. For Category 3, holiday homes are not mentioned at all. For Local Environment 195 such homes, we must revert to the topics of consideration in the Act and compare them with the guidelines that are otherwise established for Category 3. Commercial development con- siderations are not mentioned for Category 1. For Categories 2 and 3, however, it is assumed that recreational ﬁshing is a relevant interest, and this may be the basis for granting permission to build a boathouse and dock. The intensity of the various interests must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In summary, we can ascertain that the guidelines to some extent clarify how the muni- cipalities should balance the considerations for use and protection of the various shoreline areas of Norway, in accordance with the objective of clarifying national land-use policy in the 100-m belt. The formulations for the weighing of interests in the shore zone are some- what clearer than what is found in Section 1 – 8, ﬁrst paragraph of the PBA. In the statute’s preparatory works, it is clearly expressed that the general building ban in the shore zone may vary greatly for the various parts of the coast, and that there must therefore be “room for variations in practice”, cf. NOU (2003, p. 14, p. 130). Using three categories in the guidelines allows variation on a national basis, and the vague criteria within each cat- egory open for regional and local variations in practice, at least in Categories 2 and 3. 4.3. Differentiated planning-process requirements The question is here whether the guidelines are limiting the local government assessment in choice of planning processes. Pursuant to Section 12– 1 of the PBA, a zoning plan is required for major building and construction projects. Besides this, the PBA has few direc- tions concerning whether land use should be performed through master plans or zoning plans. According to the Act, this is a discretionary decision, but the guidelines provide here some more detailed clariﬁcations for the municipalities’ decision as to when a zoning plan is necessary. Similar to provisions in the guidelines that protection of the shore zone in Category 1 should be strict, there are also strict requirements for the administrative procedure if this area is to be developed. The administration should require a zoning plan here for any new development or projects. The concepts are not deﬁned, and unclear borderline ques- tions may arise when evaluating what is considered a new development or new project in accordance with the guidelines. This requirement to develop a zoning plan is not absolute but strict, narrowing the choice of action following from the statute. A somewhat less strict norm has also been indicated for Category 2. There is no absol- ute requirement to establish a zoning plan, but the administration should require a zoning plan for signiﬁcant new development of building areas for residential or leisure purposes. The fact that the guidelines here refer only to projects in the form of permanent and holiday homes is due to the Outdoor Recreation Act (1957), which regulates the public’s free right to access near permanent and holiday homes in various ways. The building of private homes often has a more privatising impact on the areas than the construction of boathouses and docks. For an assessment of what is to be deemed “signiﬁcant new development” of perma- nent or holiday homes, there needs to be a closer evaluation of the size of the project, as well as the characteristics of the area in which it is to be located, and whether it has any special value, for instance recreational use. For Category 3, the guidelines stipulate that a zoning plan is required for major building and construction projects, a requirement in accordance with Section 12– 1 of the PBA. Beyond this, no elaboration of the conditions for the planning requirement is provided. It has also been found that land use should be controlled by means of the provisions of the municipal master plan for development projects that are not particularly extensive. Due 196 S.E. Schu¨tz and I.E. Myklebust to this requirement, it has been stressed that even in shoreline areas, detailed regulation is possible and recommended to some extent, directly through the municipal master plan. 4.4. Differentiated considerations for dispensations The shore zone guidelines ﬁnally stipulate conditions for when dispensations to the PBA or local plans can be used as a tool for land-use management in the shore zone. The guidelines are more elaborate here than in the wording of the Act, and the differentiation is also based on the geographic divisions in relation to development pressures. As previously mentioned, the guidelines state that the building ban should be strictly practised in the Oslo Fjord region, and this general restriction has been followed up by the requirement to avoid granting dispensations. The aim must be to ensure a strict practice of the building ban, not allowing it to be diluted by a liberal practice of granting dispensa- tions. In Category 2, where there is a high pressure on the land, the guidelines prescribe that the building ban should be practised strictly as a rule in high pressure areas, and that dis- pensations should be totally avoided in urbanised areas where there is a high pressure on the land. In Category 3, there is no general requirement to practise the dispensation rule strictly, and dispensations may be granted for “smaller projects” on a case-by-case basis. As mentioned, in all categories, a zoning plan is always required for major building and construction projects. 4.5. The effect on government control Norwegian planning and building law is based on a scheme involving a high degree of municipal government of land-use management but, nevertheless subject to various forms of central government control. In this regard, the shore zone guidelines can be impor- tant. As we have seen in Sections 4.2– 4.4, the shore zone guidelines have provisions for differentiated land-use management, both with regard to the sections of the shore zone in Norway that may be developed and to the conditions under which this may take place. The objective of both the building ban and the shore zone guidelines is to inﬂuence both the content of the land-use plans and administrative procedures at the national, regional and local levels. How do the guidelines, in interaction with the Act, actually inﬂuence the government control of the coastal zone management? The point of departure in the PBA, Section 5 – 4, fourth paragraph, is that objections can be made if the planning proposal is contrary to “government planning guidelines”. Thus, the issue of national or regional interest in these cases is solved by the guidelines: When the plan violates the guidelines, this is per se a reason for the central government agencies to ﬁle a formal objection to the plan. Through the objection rules, the agencies in question may possibly see to it that the decision-making authority in a speciﬁc case is transferred from the municipal to the central government level. In 2009, objections were submitted against 42% of the municipal master plans and 32% of the zoning plans that were distrib- uted for consultative comments, cf. Statistics Norway. The grounds cited most often for objections are typically considerations for nature conservation, outdoor recreation, land- scape, green areas, shore zone and cultural heritage/environment. Since 2011, several land-use plans have met objections linked to the shore zone guidelines, and they have been adjudicated by the Ministry of Environment. In Norwegian law, there is also a greater consultative requirement in cases concerning dispensations than for building applications in general. In the same manner that regional and central government agencies are bodies entitled to comment on land-use planning, Local Environment 197 regional and central government agencies with ﬁelds of activity that are directly affected must have an opportunity to comment before the granting of dispensations, cf. Section 19– 1, of the PBA. In addition, the guidelines will be of importance. In the assessment of whether dispensations should be granted, the PBA state that “central government and regional frameworks and goals must be assigned particular importance”, cf. Section 19– 2, fourth paragraph. Furthermore, it is stated that the community should not grant dispensations from plans, provisions of the Act regarding plans and the prohibition in Section 1 –8 where a directly affected central government or regional authority has expressed a negative view on the application for dispensations cf. Section 19– 2, fourth paragraph. Thus the shore zone guidelines are relevant not only to the assessment of dispensations pursuant to the general instructions in Section 6 – 2 of the PBA, to serve as basis for decisions, but also because the Act gives these guidelines general relevance and importance directly in the provisions for the dispensations. In our opinion, the guidelines will have a major practical impact on local planning and building management. Objections based on the guidelines will be a strong negotiation card in shore zone cases. As a common base of knowledge for citizens and various administra- tive agencies, the shore zone guidelines can create more uniform administrative practices within the respective categories, and thus a greater degree of predictability for citizens. Some will perhaps maintain that discretion in shore zone cases has become so rigid that there would be almost no difference whether the authority lies with the central government or the municipalities. On the other hand, it can be pointed out that it is an advantage that the shore zone guidelines also state exactly what sort of leeway the municipalities have. A con- sequence might be that the municipalities pay more respect to input from consultative pro- cesses and formal objections in such cases, and the cases may thus not need to be transferred from the municipalities. Another effect of making the dispensation rule and shore zone guidelines stricter can also be fewer applications for dispensations for large or comprehensive projects in shoreline areas, or more rejections of such applications. 5. Judicial review 5.1. Introduction In this section, we will take a closer look at how the guidelines in interaction with the Act inﬂuence judicial review. Under Norwegian administrative law, the scope of judicial review is based on an interpretation of the law. Only in exceptional cases will the wording of the Act address the actual issue, and the courts will thus interpret the law, with all the relevant sources, in order to assess the scope of the review. See for example Eckhoff and Smith (2010, pp. 544– 549). The question of whether or not the courts will try the administrative procedural requirement in the planning law must be assessed based on the sources of law. What is most appropriate for the courts’ judicial review in these cases? In Section 5.2, we ﬁrst look at the review of administrative procedures. Will the courts try the requirements pursuant to the PBA? In Section 5.3, we examine judicial reviews in cases of individual dispensations. 5.2. The effect on judicial review of administrative procedures The PBA contains extensive requirements related to administrative procedures for plans and projects, and the aim is to ensure that planning and decisions “ensure transparency, 198 S.E. Schu¨tz and I.E. Myklebust predictability and public participation for all affected interests and authorities”, cf. Section 1 – 1, fourth paragraph of the PBA. As stated, the shore zone guidelines complement the administrative procedure requirements in the Act, and they provide provisions for interpret- ation, such as how to determine which projects should be assessed in the zoning plan with its accompanied procedural requirements. The aim of administrative procedures is to ensure justiﬁable decisions. In cases where the decision-making is based on extensive local and political autonomy, as is the case for the selection of a land-use purpose, the procedural requirements play a particularly important role. The nature of procedural rules may vary greatly from clear, rigid rules, to vague dis- cretionary assessments. Accordingly, the question of whether, and to what extent, the courts will review the content and scope of the planning requirements must be assessed more closely, cf. Schu¨tz (2007, pp. 192– 218). Two recent cases from the courts clarify the question. In the Norwegian Supreme Court, Norsk Retstidende (Rt.)(2009, p. 354), concerning the power plant in Muradalen, and Rt. (2009, p. 661), new U.S. embassy in Husebyskogen, it was found that even though discretionary assessments are involved in such procedural rules, the court can essentially review the procedural decisions. In the Husebyskogen case, as opposed to the case concerning the power plant in Muradalen, the Court does not state this explicitly. But according to the decision, the Court must exercise “signiﬁcant restraint” in its examinations and the intensity of the examination is low for planning assessments. It is thus a premise that the courts are essentially responsible for reviewing procedural decisions. The intensity of examination will nevertheless vary, and in the Huse- byskogen case reference was made to the fact that the requirements regarding the impact assessments will be “determined by the responsible authority based on professional and political discretion”, a clear indication that the rules have built-in elements of professional and political assessments that are not reviewed by the court. Bugge and Backer (2010, p. 123), in an extensive criticism of the judgment, ﬁnd that the reference to “professional and political discretion” has not brought the Supreme Court any closer to clariﬁcation of the scope of court review. It is difﬁcult to be more precise than to state that the intensity of the review is deter- mined based on a speciﬁc assessment of the nature of the case, and of whether important considerations for the environment, society and the affected citizens are heard, investigated and assessed. Here the shore zone guidelines will assist both the interpretation of the pro- cedural rules and the scope of the review. The guidelines emerge as a differentiation between legal assessments, and planning and political assessments. Since the guidelines provide clearer provisions for interpretation of the planning requirements in Category 1 compared to Category 2 (and Category 3, which has no provisions), the scope of pro- fessional and political discretion will be narrow in Category 1, and respectively broader in Categories 2 and 3. The shore zone guidelines clarify the procedural requirements and thus the scope of the judicial review. 5.3. The effect on judicial review of municipal dispensations Regarding the conditions for dispensations, cf. Section 19– 2, we have a somewhat special situation that it is stated explicitly in the preparatory works that the court can review the assessment of dispensations, cf. Ot.prp. nr. 32 (2007 – 2008), p. 242. The reason for this clar- iﬁcation is the fact that this was a contested issue in the former Act. Today the court thus can re-examine whether the advantages in a case clearly outweigh the disadvantages, cf. Section § 19 – 2. In this assessment, the guidelines are of important relevance, cf. Section 4.4. Local Environment 199 It is important to emphasise that the court can never grant a dispensation, only munici- palities have this competence. The court can only can set a decision aside and declare it invalid. In the court’s assessment, the guidelines are legally relevant. Throughout the rule of judicial review of municipal dispensations, the planning guidelines become relevant to the judicial assessment of development and protection. An example of what the court will probably review is dispensations in breach of the clear guidelines of Category 1. If both local and state authorities by dispensation allow for a high-rise building in the shore zone in the Oslo Fjord close to an urbanised area, the court can void the decision. To date, we have no Norwegian Supreme Court cases which illustrate the extent to which the court will review these more environmental legal considerations. 6. Conclusion The objective of the shore zone guidelines is to “elaborate on” the Act. In our opinion, it must be said that the shore zone guidelines will be able to fulﬁl such a function. Even though the guidelines have few clear and direct requirements for the municipalities, the system of objections and complaints that otherwise apply will ensure that the intentions are safeguarded. As we have seen, the shore zone guidelines are relatively speciﬁc about what interests are relevant in the various geographic categories and the pressure areas within these, and what the expected procedure is to safeguard these interests. Thus we have obtained a clearer formulation of what is “of national or signiﬁcant regional importance” in shore zone management, and of what the conditions are for making a valid objection. This clariﬁcation between what is perceived to be local policy, what is of environmentally or socially value, and what is of a more regional and national interest will probably make it easier for the various actors to justify “encroachments” on the administrative processes for which individ- ual municipalities are responsible, in accordance with the general rules of the Act. We believe that a goal of placing authority at the lowest possible level should be pursued through land-use planning. “He who wears the shoe, knows where it hurts.” In our opinion, increased guidance for the municipalities through guidelines appears to be a step in the right direction. When the central government has strong interests in land-use management questions, it is reasonable to expect that they should be expressed. This makes the national and public interests, and what is in the scope of the municipalities’ leeway and autonomy, more predictable for them. There is a ﬂowing transition between politics and law. It is important to emphasise that the prioritisation of nature and recreation is not just a question of current national policy priorities, but also a question of values that we have undertaken to protect internationally. These international obligations are ranked higher than formal law, cf. the provision on environment in Section 112 of the Norwegian Constitution (1814). In the same manner as there is a ﬂowing transition between what must be regarded as local and national policy issues, there is also a sliding transition between the topics that are considered to be of political values and more general public values. As we have seen, several planning law regulations are subjected to judicial review, but to some extent with a leeway of pro- fessional and political discretion. The extent to which the Norwegian courts will participate in discussions on the use and protection of shore zones remains to be seen. References A˚ hman, K., 2012.
