KEYWORDS Mass urban transit; transport justice; spatial justice; black lives matter; Toronto; San Francisco; free transit Mass transit in the urban age We are currently undergoing a radical global transition in the technologies and social systems of urban mobility and transportation. After its unquestionable dominance throughout the second half of the twentieth century, the system of urban automobility has reached its functional and ideological limits. Cultural trends and policy shifts indicate automobile use may be in decline in cities of global north and the global south (Sheller 2011). In the North Atlantic, for example, commentators have celebrated the ‘end of car culture’ (Rosenthal 2013) and triumphantly pro- claimed that Americans are buying few cars, driving less, getting fewer licenses, and that a counter culture of public transit is forming in the wake of this shift (Corley 2014; Hurdle 2014). A report released in 2014 from the American Public Transportation Association indicated that more Americans are using public transportation than in any year since 1956, leading the Association president to declare ‘a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities.’ Having reached ‘peak car’ (Moss 2015), a key challenge for cities in 21st century is that of post- automobile planning and growth. It is now generally accepted that car-oriented societies and car-driven urbanisms have serious and detrimental consequences: from congestion and long commutes to greenhouse gas production and sprawl, to social segregation, alienation, and ill health. Across the world, attention to these negative aspects of automobility has strengthened calls for its replacement with a less damaging alternative. In this context, transit friendly policies and transit-oriented development have become best practices of 21st century urbanism, promising solutions to automobility’s woes. Ideally, transit oriented neighbourhoods promote lowered carbon emis- sions, a reduction in traﬃc, improved air quality, land conservation, an increase in active mobilities, the creation of vibrant mixed use communities, easy and universal access to city amenities, improved territorial balance, and a renewed sense of collective life and belonging (Dittmar and Ohland 2004;Grescoe 2012). For many advocates, mass urban transit – in the CONTACT Theresa Enright theresa.enright@utoronto.ca MOBILITIES 2019, VOL. 14, NO. 5, 665–680 https://doi.org/10.1080/17450101.2019.1607156 © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group form of light rail, trams, metros, or bus rapid transit (BRT) networks – is a panacea for the faults of twentieth century planning, and an essential feature of a sustainable urban future. Yet a transit network is more than a neutral technology of eﬃcient movement rationally constructed by engineers and planning experts. It is a highly political artifact that materializes a particular organization of collective life. All transport infrastructures condense social and political ideals. Mass urban transit in other words is always pursued for distinct purposes, and for the beneﬁt of some urban dwellers and to the detriment of others. As ‘political infrastructures’ (McFarlane and Rutherford 2008), mass transit systems are imbricated in fundamental questions about who belongs in the city, who is allowed to participate fully in urban activities, who decides how space will be planned and produced, and who gains from urban transformation. Transit is a complex bundle of often invisible political relations – of for example, poverty, racism, ecology, and citizenship – that condense power dynamics. Contrary to the celebratory proclamations of anti-car advocates and the conventional wisdom of transit-oriented development supporters, mass transit is not an unqualiﬁed good set to beneﬁt all equally. While transit-led urbanism seeks to cure cities and regions of the woes of automobility through a range of broad environmental, economic, and social beneﬁts, it also has the potential to entrench existing hierarchies and to create new forms of urban marginality, inequality, and exclusion. Transit can be a vector of progressive change, or it can threaten bodily integrity, drive uneven development, segregate populations, ‘splinter’ urban space (Graham and Marvin 2001), reduce democratic inﬂuence, contribute to environmental injustice, and replicate and generate oppressive social relations. Given that infrastructures of mobility are political and not merely technical artifacts, urban systems organized around transit are not necessarily more communal or progressive than those dominated by automobility. Metro, tram, BRT, and light rail mobility systems are rife with their own constitutive tensions and challenges. In this light, it is important to account for mass transit as a space of conﬂict over values, what Castells (1983) calls the ‘meaning’ of urban society. Transit justice is a crucial political and ethical issue at the heart of the contemporary mobility transition and the search for more sustainable and equitable cities. The contested regimes of mass transit being forged today are thus an essential terrain where the logics and contradictions of contem- porary urbanism are being played out. This paper considers how the provision of mass urban transit is tied to agendas of social justice and equity. In treating transit infrastructure as fully produced and thoroughly political space, it reveals new perspectives on the geographies of domination, and it locates transit networks as sites for resisting and overcoming various forms of injustice (c.f. Soja 2010). This paper proceeds ﬁrst by outlining the analytical challenges associated with locating justice in the complex relations that comprise urban mobility regimes (e.g. how transit is bound up with aﬀordable housing, sustainable ecologies, poverty reduction, anti-racism, or democratic governance at multiple scales). Following this, it examines two transit-based social movements, Free Transit Toronto and Black Lives Matter (BLM) in the San Francisco Bay Area. Thinking with these activist movements, this paper identiﬁes three limitations to transport justice scholarship and practice, namely the theorization of mobility, space, and justice. These activist struggles demonstrate that justice cannot be adequately deﬁned through an abstract accounting of how harms and beneﬁts are distributed, but also concerns the contextual and conﬂictual processes of producing space and subjects. Assessing how transit infrastructure is involved in the dynamics and ethics of contemporary urbanization in this way enables a better understanding of how urban orders come into being and transform over time, of the power dynamics of contemporary metropolises, and of the possibilities for just urban futures. Urbanization and networked justice Networked infrastructures of transportation over the past half century have played a particularly important role in articulating social justice movements. The Montgomery Bus Boycott and Freedom 666 T. ENRIGHT Rides, for example, were essential in the history of North American anti-racist and civil rights movements. More recently, general transit strikes have also been crucial to labour and anti-poverty movements in Paris, Toronto, and in cities across Brazil. In the San Francisco Bay Area, transit has been an important battleground in popular movements against privatization, the rising costs of urban living, gentriﬁcation, and the structuring power of rent. Control over the transit system in Caracas has been linked to popular struggles for autonomy, socialism, and democracy. And in light of looming ecological disaster, urban transport systems in Sydney and Beijing are also central to environmentalists’ agendas calling for sustainable development, pollution reduction, and decarbo- nization. Indeed, activist organizations, social movements, and campaigns focusing on justice in mass transit are ﬂourishing in cities around the world. Given that transit conditions residents’ fundamental ability to move through the city and to access its resources and opportunities, it is at the very heart of contemporary struggles over urban space and urban living. These mobility struggles are about much more than simply getting from point A to point B; they frequently concern the more fundamental conditions of urban existence and the essential capacity for participation in collective life. Yet when transit equity and transport justice are considered in the literature, they are typically framed in quite narrow terms of how the costs and beneﬁts of transit – understood as an exemplary public good – are distributed unevenly geographically and to select populations (Hertel, Roger, and Collens 2015; Garrett and Taylor 1999; Litman 2002,; Mercier 2009; Pereira, Schwanen, and Banister 2017).1 Building on the work of activists and scholars who have long demonstrated how transit planning and policymaking have either ignored or negatively disadvan- taged people of colour, the poor, the elderly, women, and the disabled, transit equity discourses promote greater fairness in transit’s impacts (Bullard, Johnson, and Torres 2004; Golub and Martens 2014; Lucas 2004). Drawing on liberal conceptions of social justice that see atomized, universal, rational, and rights-bearing individuals as the recipients of discrete social products, these equity claims tend to concern demands for more service, more equally spread out service, or for particular types of modal options. For Litman (2002), for example, transit equity refers to the fairness with which transit impacts are distributed. Lucas and Jones (2012) also use this metric, measuring what they refer to as the disproportionate impact of ‘transit goods’ (e.g. speed, quality of infrastructure, access to opportunities) and ‘transit bads’ (e.g. congestion, air and noise pollution, segrega- tion). Rock, Ahern, and Caulﬁeld (2014)callfor ‘the fair distribution of transport impacts (beneﬁts and costs) throughout all sectors of society,’ while Beyazit (2011)deﬁnes equity more comprehensively as ‘the fairness in the physical distribution of goods, accessibility for people, aﬀordability of all types of services and distribution of other gains (such as increases in land and property prices).’ For these commentators, a lack of parity in transit experience, opportunity, and access results in transit injustice. Most liberal policies of redress, then, seek variations of utilitarian, egalitarian or suﬃcientarian remedies to readminister the positive and negative aspects of certain transport modes (Wee and Geurs 2011). The goal of redistribution is not always standard treatment for all (i.e. equality), but diﬀerentiated supports to indivi- duals and populations so that those who are currently disadvantaged can gain greater access to the social goods of urban transit (i.e. equity). While the more nuanced of liberal analyses attempt to account for complex and inter- dependent transport products (Bannister 2007;Mercier 2009), transport and social welfare (Lucas 2004), diverse transport meanings and needs (Levy 2013;Martens 2012), transport and urban capabilities and welfare (Hananel and Berechman 2016;Pereira,Schwanen,and Banister 2017) and unequal transport decision making powers (Hananel and Berechman 2016; Gössling 2016), there is a consensus on the bottom-line justiﬁcation of distributional fairness to be achieved through better transit policy. Transit equity in the liberal framework seeks the building of more transit in more places, a shift in who beneﬁts and loses from transit goods, and improved access to the social opportunities that transit provides. It treats MOBILITIES 667 justice as a static end to be achieved through the incorporation of the marginalized into an existing spatial and social system. Following from these liberal conceptions of transit equity, scholars, activists and practitioners are calling for policymakers and planners to better incorporate justice concerns into transit decision making (see, for example, UN Habitat 2016). Most prominently, in the United States, this has resulted in the broad expansion of environmental justice principles to assess transportation issues. Indeed, metropolitan planning organizations and the U.S. Department of Transportation agencies have begun to focus on applied environmental justice as a key component of transport planning with strategies to reduce adverse health and environmental eﬀects on minority and low-income populations and to ensure that all receive equitable beneﬁts. Despite these imperatives and widespread lip-service to social inclusion and sustainability, transit equity norms are still marginal to decision making and substantive justice remains largely elusive. There is a glaring gap between the rhetoric of transit equity and the realities of diﬀerential urban (im)mobilities. In part, this diﬃculty in achieving equity goals is explain- able by the existence of an implementation gap in transport planning (Gössling 2016). While eﬀorts to emphasize social justice in transportation are growing, there is as of yet no shared method instituted across transportation agencies to identify transport justice areas, and no standard set best practices to address inequity. Globally and in North America, each agency and jurisdiction operationalizes its own deﬁnitions and methodologies of equity (Belier and Mohammed 2016), which has led several scholars to call for better equity measures and more streamlined approaches to planning best practices (Belier and Mohammed 2016;Martens 2016; Martens, Golub, and Robinson 2012; Pereira, Schwanen, and Banister 2017; Hananel and Berechman 2016). Critical transport scholars have moreover lamented that ‘(1)There is no clear deﬁnition in practice or theory, of what constitutes a fair distribution of beneﬁts from transportation invest- ments; and (2) no standards, goals or performance measures exist, against which agencies can measure progress or success in the distribution of transportation beneﬁts’ (Martens, Golub, and Robinson 2012, 684). Thus, there is ‘little conceptual clarity about what justice means in the transport context’ (Pereira, Schwanen, and Banister 2017, 170). In other words, for the successful achievement of transport justice, there is a corresponding need for robust theoretical justiﬁcation and vision. I argue here that it is our still too-limited vision of transport justice – and indeed, our very notion that justice can be deﬁned in isolation of context – that contributes to the continua- tion of injustice. Existing liberal distributional theories and environmental justice frameworks are useful for identifying the criteria of harm and for tracing how transport has denied freedoms, opportunities, beneﬁts, and rewards to certain users. Yet they have diﬃculty accounting for more complex, dynamic, and systematic entanglements through which urban transit and urban space is continually produced. The liberal model, then, is an important starting point for asserting more equitable transportation regimes, but it is rather limited when it comes to addressing the full stakes of transport justice in the context of global urbanization. While there have been some notable works which usefully extend and expand the theoretical vision of distribution (see, for example, Davoudi and Brooks 2014; Martens 2016;Pereira,Schwanen,andBanister 2017) by and large, how to link the collective right to mobility to the right to the city more broadly remains unclear. This latter notion of justice is particularly vexing as it cannot be captured through any form of rational accounting or through universal models of fair distribution. It cannot assume pre-existing objects (e.g. people or neighbourhoods) or end points. Transit justice read as a variant of the right to the city is a complex and broad process that entails transforming entire mobility (and therefore social and spatial) systems. To achieve this, there is a need to consider transport justice beyond frameworks of fairness and beyond transport as such. 668 T. ENRIGHT There are three main limitations to existing accounts of transit justice. (1) In isolating transit from its networked social context, either in diagnosis or remedy, conven- tional frameworks of transit justice are insuﬃcient. This is particularly evident when the multifaceted relations of in/justice are reduced to ideas and policies of equity, or when commuting alone stands in for the dense social worlds of which mass mobility is a part. 2 (2) Without attention to justice and injustice as ongoing spatial processes, existing frameworks of transit justice de-emphasize the role of transit in the production of space and subjects. The emphasis on more mass transit, for example, or greater transit accessibility – though hopeful – is inadequate to undo the deeply embedded and historically rooted structures of advantage and disadvantage constitutive of contemporary urban society and continually wrought through infrastructures of mobility. (3) Lastly, studies based on liberal theories of distributive justice – many of which are inspired by the works of John Rawls – sidestep the contentious politics necessary to bring about a just society and to fundamentally transform the relations of power undergirding mobility. Policymakers and theorists seldom engage working people and people of colour and their struggles for the city. A more comprehensive version of transport justice would take into account how mobility is a matter of many networked social relations and material processes at multiple scales. Reconceptualizing transport justice in this way can give rise in turn to more complex moral assessment measures and city-building practices that consider not merely redistribution, but a radical change in how resources are created and valued and how these in turn condition substantive freedom and self-determination. Such a framework would need to address both the processural nature of urbanization as social production, and its networked and political constitu- tion. The aim of this paper is to reﬂect on the systemic parameters of transport justice and to consider the challenges associated with putting these norms into practice. It does this by invoking examples of transit activism that are frequently and problematically absent from transport justice theorizations. In this sense, the paper theorizes transport justice inductively from street level (or track level) demands, rather than deductively from universal principles. It does not aim to verify the truth of activist demands or to deﬁne the truth of the movements. Rather, it reads and aﬃrms social movements and struggles for actually existing transit systems as important sites for acting and envisioning justice. It seeks to think with these movements as important sites of creativity and critique. The paper analyses the respective discourses of transport activism in San Francisco and Toronto by examining how issues of mobility and justice are framed, what demands are made, what policies are proposed, and what tactics are employed. Transport justice, like urban justice more generally, is therefore treated as utterly pragmatic and contextual (Harvey 2010). In lieu of abstract moralism, transport justice is lived and living; it is open to interpretation and deliberation and achieved through contentious praxis and engagement. The two cases chosen are thus used not to make any deﬁnitive causal assertions about the essential and ﬁxed meaning of transport justice or the best practices and policies necessary to bring it about, but as examples which reveal new ways of seeing and seeking justice. Through this exercise, the paper reveals the complex nature of transit-led urbanization and illuminates transit as an exigent terrain of social and political struggle. It also identiﬁes several limitations to conventional transport scholarship and practice, namely the theorization of mobility, space, and justice. It claims that transport qua spatial justice is not merely distributional but involves the conﬂictual processes of producing space and subjects and participating in the social and political life of the city. Tying insights from transit struggles to the burgeoning discourse on transport justice and critical transport studies enables more expansive and active frameworks of justice that can call into being diﬀerent regimes of mobility and diﬀerent kinds of urban societies. MOBILITIES 669 Free transit in the greater Toronto area Free Transit Toronto (FTT) is a campaign to make transit in the Greater Toronto Area a free public service, ‘like the libraries or Medicare’ (FTT 2018). The activist organization and demand grew out of the Free and Accessible Transit Campaign (FATC), a subcommittee founded in 2010 as part of the Greater Toronto Workers Assembly (GTWA).3 However, the idea for free transit in the city of Toronto has its roots in a more longstanding agenda of the Toronto District Labour Council which has been calling for accessible and aﬀordable transit across the city since the 1970s. With Free Transit Toronto, then, traditional local labour concerns (primarily over access to employment) have been situated within a broader social agenda and tied to a growing international discourse around free mobility and free movement. Like other free transit campaigns around the world (for a comprehensive list, see https://fare freepublictransport.com/city/), FTT sees the universal provision of transit choices as an important economic, social, and environmental goal. The group advocates for free public transportation as a way to provide urban dwellers with robust access to city jobs, neighbourhoods, services, and amenities while reducing private automobile use. With the slogan ‘no fare is fair’ the group stresses the public service nature of mass transportation (FACT 2012). Mass transportation is, in other words, a service that should be equally available to all inhabitants regardless of socio-economic status, ability, or residential or employment location. ‘All of us would be able to travel anywhere within our city when we need to’ (FACT 2012). Looking to other cities such as Aubagne, France, Chengdu, China, and Tallin, Estonia that have implemented no fare policies, they assert that free transit is an entirely viable alternative to the current pay-per-service model of urban mobility, and one that has enormous potential to beneﬁt society writ large. In this sense, free transit is poised to address multiple forms of social and spatial inequality. Free Transit Toronto was formed to address urgent and far-reaching problems of Toronto’s public transit network that is primarily controlled by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). Indeed, the poor state of transit is a high proﬁle and contentious issue in Toronto. The challenges are numerous. There is a widespread frustration at poor quality of transit operations and persistent stalling on construction of new projects, transit governance is divided between multiple governments and institutions leading to pitched battles over planning and ﬁnancing, and in terms of rapid transit coverage, Toronto pales in comparison to other similarly sized cities. The FTT movement and their partner organizations identify the main problems of Toronto’s transit as a legacy of neoliberal policies at multiple scales resulting in expensive and rising ridership costs; congestion, service breakdowns and repair backlogs; inadequate transit routes; a high farebox ratio (the fraction of operating expenses paid by passenger fares) that puts the ﬁnancial burden of transit operation on its ‘customers’; infrastructure gaps and transit deserts; inaccessible stations and vehicles for those with reduced mobility; poor regional coordination; privatization of transit construction and operation; and a business approach to management (see also Allen and Farber 2019; Hertel, Roger, and Collens 2015; Hertel, Keil, and Collens 2016; TTCriders 2012). These concerns are frequently framed in public discourse as issues of equity and justice (Keenan 2015). Free Transit Toronto combats these problems with an integrated and multipronged approach. Through their letter writing campaigns, public demonstrations, community consulta- tions, and educational activities, the group advocates for justice-based transit solutions begin- ning with ensuring daily survival for working-class populations. In pursuit of this end, the short term demands of Free Transit Toronto include freezing all fares with the aim of gradually reducing them, and eliminating fares for least mobile and most transit-dependent including seniors, low income people, people receiving social assistance and the unemployed (FACT 2014). It also seeks the urgent incorporation of populations and neighbourhoods that, through historic patterns of service and disservice, have been disconnected from the overall economic and cultural life of the city. 670 T. ENRIGHT These targeted measures are prioritized, but they are not the ends of the transit justice agenda. “Free” transit was taken up as a demand that would build towards a diﬀerent kind of society: getting rid of fares would create a real right to mobility for all working people; all people could use transit to shop, take care of their families, enjoy recreation, get to and from work and become part of their larger communities; it would be a key step in challenging our reliance on fossil fuels and private cars, addressing the demands of the environment; it would require massive investment in public infrastructure to provide decent access to public transit in communities and neighbourhoods across Canada’s cities, and therefore require changes to invest- ment and taxation policies that would challenge austerity and reliance on private investment; it would contribute to reshaping how we live, where we live and where we work. (FTT 2018) Longer term goals seek to transform the very conditions of marginality in access and decision- making through establishing stable operational funding streams from the provincial and federal governments; building new transit in working class neighbourhoods; restoring full public owner- ship of all transit services, stock and maintenance; and replacing the leadership of the regional transit authority Metrolinx (a Provincial transit agency led by appointed board) with a democratic planning body (FACT 2014). These eﬀorts would not only redistribute harms and beneﬁts, but they transform the terrain of urban movement and patterns of mobility by overhauling the local, regional and national mobility regimes that control transit and are generative of inequalities. Beyond ensuring the beneﬁts of the existing transit system accrue to a wider public, FTT thus explicitly seeks to use the campaign for free transit as a catalyst in a broader red-green programme to transform society at large (FACT 2012; Kipfer 2012). In making transit free, they seek to remove commuting from the commodiﬁed realm and thus to dramatically alter the basic structures of urban inhabitation and movement. Transit is a critical issue for people in Toronto, as in all major urban areas. More is at stake than reducing traﬃc congestions and gridlock. Transit and general mobility are intimately related to larger issues in capitalist society: how goods and services are produced and delivered; the location of a nature of jobs; where and how we live and travel; issues of class, inequality and oppression related to race, age, gender and sexuality; climate justice; and the very shape and nature of our democratic institutions. . .The. . . initiative opens the door to a broader transformation of urban life and the current social system. (FATC 2012) The demarketization of transit and the de-instrumentalization of urban mobility beyond the goal of serving capital accumulation are ﬁrst and necessary steps toward the socialization of urban life. The long-term demands are thus more radical and far-reaching. These include the creation of a robust public transit system, free of fares, funded by taxes and general revenues; the coordination of transit and social housing provision; and the development of new regional decision-making practices based on the democratization of infrastructure and community planning, where workers, users, and residents are co-producers of mobility systems and metropolitan spaces (FACT 2014). Free transit is a vehicle to reinvigorate the notion of ‘the public’– public space, public property, the public sector, and public service – and to place it at the heart of urban planning. Through these more systemic transformations, free transit is a vehicle in the radical transformation of the entire social order away from private and marketized relations toward relations that enhance communal livelihoods, ensure ecological health, and engender individual and collective freedom. It challenges the multiple valences of capitalist urbanization by overturning the role of transit in accumulation dynamics and by revaluing urban space. And it empowers individuals and commu- nities by providing them not only greater access to the shared resources and opportunities that the city provides, but greater power to direct and manage their relations of movement and rest. Black lives matter in the San Francisco Bay Area Black Lives Matter is an international campaign, social media hashtag, and loose coalition of activists that emerged in 2012 after the death of Trayvon Martin. BLM became especially salient in 2014 following the fatal shooting of Mike Brown by Ferguson police. With the slogan ‘shut it down’ since 2014 BLM protests have occurred in cities across the U.S. and Canada against MOBILITIES 671 extrajudicial killings, police brutality, and systemic racism. Black Lives Matter actions typically aim to disrupt the status quo in ways that are highly visible so that business as usual – which for many people of colour is unbearable – cannot continue. Although BLM calls for anti-racist politics broadly construed, transit has been notably central in articulating campaigns. In this endeavor, urban spaces of transportation, long inhospitable to black life, have been key tactical terrains. Black Lives Matter demonstrations often target key urban ﬂows, for example, blockades of major freeways; ‘die-ins’ at mobility hubs including New York’s Grand Central station; protests to stop commuter trains in Boston, and the stalling of subways on the LA Blue Line metro. The interlinking of transit activism and anti-racist action has been especially prominent in the SF Bay Area. The public transit network, and especially the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), has become a particularly iconic symbol and key rallying point of the movement because of way the network has historically galvanized racist disadvantage and violence. Black Lives Matter and other community organizations have identiﬁed many pressing issues of transit racism in the region. These include the linking of large scale transportation projects to the destruction and displacement of black neighbourhoods and communities; BART’s active role in tech-driven gentriﬁcation; deep imbalances in transportation funding and investment in the Bay Area between commuter rail like BART (which has a predominantly white middle-class commuter ridership) and local bus and rail MUNI and AC Transit (which have a greater black and Latinx and low income ridership); aggressive and racialized anti-homeless policies; MUNI’s involvement in racial proﬁling in fare policing (in some cases arrests for non-payment have led to immigration reporting and deportation); rising costs of fares; an elimination of services in low-income and racialized neighbourhoods; and widespread environmental racism whereby minority neighbour- hoods have borne an undue burden of air and noise pollution (see especially Golub, Marchantonio, and Sanchez 2013; Henderson 2013; Klein 2015; Lo and Rein 2010; Mayer and Marcantonio 2010; POWER 2012). Many of these issues were addressed in a 2013 campaign titled ‘Next Stop: Justice’ by the grassroots organization People Organized to Win Employment Rights (POWER). The primary concern of BLM, however, is the institutionalized culture in the transit system of police brutality and murder. The shooting death of Oscar Grant at Fruitvale station on New Year’s Day 2009 is the most well-known case here but there are countless others as well who have been killed or injured at hands of transit police. To contest this very broad nexus of issues, BLM along with the local blackout collective held an action on Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving) in 2014. Activists literally put their lives on the line by chaining themselves to one another and through train cars stopped at the West Oakland BART station, a choke point for the system. By disrupting the train’s progress out of the station, and staging a demonstration on the tracks they managed to shut down the entire BART network during morning traﬃc on this popular shopping day. This gesture aimed not merely to inconvenience riders on their daily commute, but was a means of refusing the longstanding restrictions on black mobility and repudiating the violence of the transit system on black bodies and communities. The signiﬁcance is described by participants in broad terms (quoted in DeBolt 2015): “It’s clear that black lives don’t matter to BART. BART has played an active role in breaking up black communities in Oakland – ﬁrst in West Oakland, when the BART was built. The land for the station was taken from black homes and businesses through eminent domain, displacing Black communities and starting a pattern of gentriﬁcation that West Oakland still suﬀers from today.” “As long as black folks cannot move freely through this country, no one will.” “We decided to ﬁnd a target relevant to our area. . .Oscar Grant was murdered at the Fruitvale station on BART. . .A thriving black community [at the West Oakland station] was divided and gutted by the development of BART. BART is a very real representation of how our regional economy functions. . .It was important to us that the call was about stopping business as usual until we get justice for our communities.” 672 T. ENRIGHT Fourteen people were arrested that day for interfering with the train operations. This initial protest then sparked several subsequent demonstrations at BART stations. Rolling protests each Friday in 2015 demanded the charges against the Black Friday 14 be dropped, while participants also called for the institution of low-income fares and the disarming of the BART police. Demonstrators explicitly linked racist police brutality to the paucity of service oﬀerings to the non-aﬀordability of the system, to regional development priorities. The integrity and free movement of racialized bodies is connected to the dispossession of space and culture, to the uneven development of San Francisco as a techno-hub and the startling inequalities of residents therein, to land use and the built environment, to issues of citizenship and national borders. Indeed, BLM claims reveal that transit racism operates across multiple scales and through complex relations, systems, and formations. Against multifaceted forms of violence, then, the BLM and associated mobility protests since 2014 stressed the necessary and joint pursuits of economic, racial and transit justice. Aﬃrming their right to be able to move freely regardless of race, status, or income, riders and residents have been drawing attention to the presence of black and brown bodies in the city, and calling for the reformation of BART as a means to reform urban life more generally. Transit infrastructure in this sense is treated a crucial – and currently non-functioning – life support system. Transit justice and urbanization Far from single-issue movements, both FTT and BLM use a critique of mass urban transit as a platform to make contested claims for liberation, access, decision-making ability and a share of the common wealth that city produces. The movements argue that the commodiﬁcation of territory, the degradation of the environment, the decline of the public sector, civil rights, and the marginalization of communities are interlinked processes related to mobility’s far-reaching and life-sustaining role in the city. They want something beyond those forms of equity and justice that currently dominate transit discourses. While there are important diﬀerences in the histories, organization forms, tactics, and aims of BLM and FTT, what is signiﬁcant here is that both cases examined conceive of transit justice not merely in terms of inclusion or redistribution, but as an activity of transformation that will change the social system of mobility as well as the built environment more fundamentally. Highlighting the spatiality of freedom, equality and democracy, and its dynamic composition, they ground social justice in space in general and in mobility infrastructure in speciﬁc. Both movements involve refusing transit’s role in the production of certain kinds of urban subjects – customers/criminals – and in the production of particular types of urban space – racialized transit deserts/gleaming new TOD enclaves and technopoles. Looking at these two cases of transit activism and the activist milieu they comprise thus reveals a threefold critique of transport justice as its currently understood and practiced: 1) how it has theorized mobility, 2) how it has conceived of the production of space, and 3) its sense of justice. The following discussion learns from social movements and reframes activists’ insights in order to further the scholarship on transport justice.4 Mobility The two cases demonstrate the need to understand mass transit as a dense matrix of durable and interlinked political relationships and not merely as a matter of autonomous commuting. Transit in this light cannot be treated as a matter of how individuals might choose to traverse the city. Nor is it suﬃcient to treat transit as an isolated public policy arena. Rather, transit for FTT and BLM is deeply embedded in the constitution of urban geographies and histories and emerges from complex and collective dynamics of movement, broadly construed. Commuting is but an element in a wider system of land use, urban development, policing, employment, education, health, and MOBILITIES 673 recreation. One lesson this holds for critical transport scholarship and for urban planning is the need to think systematically and comprehensively about transit equity. The new mobilities paradigm (Cresswell 2006, 2006; Sheller and Urry 2006) is a useful starting point for scholars looking to incorporate this perspective. Providing rich qualitative accounts of broadly- conceived movements, this scholarship shows how mobility can best be understood in relation to contingent political, cultural, economic and social forces (Urry 2007). Mobility is not merely the expression of an individual’s free will to change locations in an eﬃcient fashion, but read holistically, is an ever-changing and complex assemblage of human and non-human actors, technologies, informa- tion, goods and images. Urry (2007) refers to these transportation assemblages as ‘mobility systems,’ while to capture their political nature, Böhm et al. (2006) call them ‘mobility regimes.’ Urban mobility regimes give rise to social worlds and they fundamentally shape everyday life and culture, as well as political economic patterns of production, consumption and distribution at multiple scales. Transit impacts are thus multivalent, inﬂuencing quality of life outcomes, environ- mental sustainability, the built form, economic growth, democratic participation, and community development. Therefore, as Hertel, Roger, and Collens (2015, x) point out, ‘[t]ransit investments, by their very nature, have consequences beyond capital (rolling stock, terminals) and the operations (routes, headways) they support. . .They also build cities, enable communities, empower individuals to participate in society’s opportunities more fully.’ Simply viewing transit justice in terms of fair distribution cannot alone account for the way transit is imbricated, for example, in relations of poverty, gentriﬁcation, urban-suburban conﬂicts, environmen- tal governance, social alienation, or racialized surveillance. As Litman (2002)notes, ‘[t]ransport equity can be diﬃcult to evaluate because there are various types, impacts, measurement units and categories of people to consider.’ Moreover, beyond even the calculations of equity, transport justice requires a deep understanding of the multiscalar and complex dynamics linking mobility, urbaniza- tion, and urban life that refuse quantiﬁcation and commensurability. Mimi Sheller (2017)argues, current approaches to transport justice and other areas like climate justice, environmental justice, and even spatial justice. . .have not connected enough and have not shown in enough ways how embodied diﬀerences in class, gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality and physical ability all inﬂuence accessibility and interact with the mobility regimes and control systems that reproduce uneven mobilities both locally and globally. The kind of transport justice advocated by BLM and FTT activists is akin to what Sheller calls ‘mobility justice,’ a systemic framework that analyses multiple interacting relations of movement – of, for example, people, goods, information, resources and capital.5 It is broader systems of mobility that are at stake in transit struggles. In San Francisco, BLM acknowledges that transit has long been a vehicle of segregation, exclusion, and displacement, that has marginalized black and Latinx residents. Regional transportation planning processes – whether explicitly cast in racial terms, or in neutral technocratic ones – have long produced racialized geographies of advantage and disadvantage and have enforced inequalities of opportu- nity and power in the built environment (Allen 2009; Golub, Marchantonio, and Sanchez 2013;Lo and Rein 2010). In Toronto, the racial circuitries of transit are less explicit, but transit nevertheless acts as a key apparatus for valuing territories and populations and for determining life chances (Hertel, Roger, and Collens 2015). Activists are not responding to isolated policy issues, but to a nexus of urban conditions. While the contests and aims of the movements diﬀer greatly, FTT and BLM nevertheless converge on the idea that transit justice planning and policy-making must therefore comprise a holistic mode of city-building. Starting from the many demands and desires of residents they open up to integrated paradigms of urbanism and governance. To address the fuller extent of social relations in which transit is embedded, both movements suggest that justice move beyond ‘programmatic’ solutions that target particular disadvantaged individuals and neighbourhoods, toward more fundamental ‘structural’ changes to property and political processes (Litman and Brenman 2012). Justice in this sense concerns how to allocate 674 T. ENRIGHT resources to improve the capabilities and conditions of the least well oﬀ, but it also involves the radical reconstitution of how transit related resources are bound up in dynamic social relationships and processes that give rise to freedom, welfare and collective wellbeing in the broadest sense. Space Reconceptualizing transit as a mobility regime reveals transit networks as key sociotechnical institutions through which cities are being created and transformed. In the case of Toronto, FTT see transit as a crucial driver of urban development, and therefore as a platform for class struggle. In the Bay Area, BLM protestors contest how the transit networks currently mark and make black life. An additional lesson that follows from these claims is that greater attention also needs to be given to how transit is an essential factor in the ongoing production of urban space and urban subjects. In the two aforementioned cases, the production of space does not refer to a single linear process directed by an omnipotent planning apparatus, but is the result of (often unintentional and uncoordinated) actions of individuals, communities, planners, elected oﬃcials, corporations, and institutions. It is material and symbolic, objective and lived. While explicitly racist, classist, ageist or ableist decisions certainly continue to create unequal outcomes in transit projects, even suppo- sedly rationalized and technical decision making and policies can have nefarious results that entrench, reproduce, or generate injustices. Free Transit Toronto is insightful for its assertion that the production of space today is dominated by market forces and processes that see transportation as a vehicle for the creation of urban rent. In Toronto, as in the San Francisco Bay Area, mass transit systems mobilize space for capitalist accumulation by improving land values, encouraging (often speculative) development, selling wellbeing, and increasing city attractiveness. Transit is essential to the commodiﬁcation of urban space. As they are essential to production, social reproduction, and ﬁnance, transit networks site battles between use and exchange values now and into the future (on how these transit battles have played out in Toronto and the Bay Area more generally, see Kohn 2016). Social movements are also useful for illuminating how transit systems in the Bay Area and in Toronto co-create diﬀerent kinds of urban subjects and lifestyles. FTT and BLM show that transit systems inﬂuence conduct in macro ways through directing how where and when and for what purpose people move, and in more micro ways through timetables, security and surveillance technologies and norms of conduct and citizenship. This is observable most dramatically in the Bay Area where BART codes a normal and desireable customer as wealthy and white (Klein 2015), while marking people of colour as deviant and criminal, and subjecting them to the violent force of the law. Transit justice as practiced by transit activists is not limited to the equitable redistribution of resources, but addresses the diverse ways those resources are produced, coded, and enacted. The ﬂexible notion of transit justice sought by FTT and BLM aims to account for how processes of spatial production and subject formation themselves inﬂuence the equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. It promotes an individualized right to move freely at the same time that it transforms the social conditions of those movements. Cities, transit networks, and riders are not distinct entities, but they are constituted through each other over time. Thus, transit justice must also be dynamic and relational. To achieve this, and in order to disrupt the status quo of racial capitalism, new ways of city-building and new orienting values need to be invented and embraced. Justice Building on the insights of Black Lives Matter and Free Transit Toronto, it is thus useful to reconsider transit justice as something akin to spatial justice. For Soja (2010), spatial justice refers to the fact that social harms are always bound up with the political organization of space. Soja’s notion of spatial justice like Henri’s Lefebvre’s(1996) notion of the Right to the City (see also MOBILITIES 675 Harvey 2008; Purcell 2003) before it, thus raises important questions about who controls urban processes and how social and spatial justice are intertwined. For these authors, the right to the city is a demand that space be produced collectively and in the interest of those currently excluded from the ‘center’ of value, creativity, decision, and vitality. It is an assertion of the use value of the city over its exchange value. Moreover, it aﬃrms an inalienable capacity not just to ‘participate’ in existing planning institutions, but collectively to reinvent and reinvigorate urban life against all forms of segregation, exploitation and hierarchy. Soja writes, ‘[s]patial (in)justice can be seen as both outcome and process, as geographies or distributional patterns that are in themselves just/ unjust and as the processes that produce these outcomes.’ In other words, it must transform not only how harms and beneﬁts are shared, but how, and by whom, they are generated and managed. Notably, when Soja begins to seek spatial justice in his 2010 book, he begins with the now iconic struggle of the bus riders union in Los Angeles. Urban transportation, according to Soja, is a key site of entrenched discrimination, and consequently, he claims, ‘The Bus Riders Union case provides an evocative beginning for a wide ranging exploration of spatial justice as a theoretical concept, a focal point for empirical analysis, and a target for social and political action’ (Soja 2010, 1). Yet after introducing this framework of transit activism and transit-oriented justice, he then drops the transit theme. Relatively few studies have continued down this path of tying transit justice to the right to the city, or treating transit activists as theorists and practitioners of justice (for exceptions see Attoh 2012; Caldeira 2013; Cook and Butz 2018; Kohn 2016; Verlinghieri and Venturini 2017). Black Lives Matter and Free Transit Toronto not only continue the indispensable work of transit activists such as the Bus Riders Union, they also ‘see’ transit justice in ways that are theoretically productive. As demonstrated by FTT and BLM, the principles of transit justice are immediate, ubiquitous, and pragmatic. They pertain to speciﬁc local spaces, and to the relations through which they are continually assembled. As injustice for FTT and BLM is a matter both of form and process, justice must comprise the re-ordering of spaces (redistribution) and a transformation of the very processes generative of inequality (predistribution). 6 Transit justice as spatial justice includes particular and immediate demands and it moves beyond these, seeking possibilities that are as of yet undeﬁned. The notions of justice enacted by movements are conceptually rich. While the existing literature on transit equity and justice according to conventional paradigms of redistribution (of power, resources, and opportunities) is undoubtedly crucial for guiding more progressive policymaking and planning, I read activist work to suggest that this needs to be supplemented by an expanded theory of spatial justice that also takes into account the myriad ways that transit and mobility are bound up with the production of space and the production of urban subjects at multiple sites and scales. Taking cues from FTT and BLM, transit justice concerns traditional issues such as how public goods are shared fairly or how individual civil rights might be upheld, but transit also poses new ethical questions about metropolitan democracy, equality and liberty. Viewed through the lens of spatial justice, transit justice includes not merely the right of individuals to move in conventional ways and to beneﬁt from common goods, but, more impor- tantly, the capacity of inhabitants to direct and transform relations of movement and rest and to reclaim the ‘mobility commons’ (Nikolaeva et al. 2016; Sheller 2017). It involves more radical inﬂuence in managing collective life, a non-alienated existence, bodily integrity, and a ﬂourishing of agency and freedom. Moreover, transit activists show us in dramatic fashion how even these spatial justice tenets need to be thought in more systematic, dynamic, and creative ways. Conclusion The Free Transit Toronto and Bay Area Black Lives Matter campaigns put forth hopeful alternative visions of the city and its dynamics of mobility. While neither movement was successful in terms of achieving its objectives, they are both signiﬁcant for illuminating the exigencies of transit justice 676 T. ENRIGHT and for clarifying a comprehensive and critical understanding of transit’s dialectical position in the social production of space. This paper has argued that FTT and BLM reveal new ways of thinking about transport justice by reframing conventional understandings of mobility, space, and justice. The two cases examined here take as a starting point the fact that mobility is deeply impacted by embodied practices of racialization, the violence of proﬁling, the accumulation dynamics of uneven development, and the governance of class and capital. Activists contesting the diﬀerential eﬀects of these relations frame justice as a participatory and productive matter of building the physical characteristics of a city and creating urban life in ways that refuse domination and segregation. While both movements seek redistributive remedies to historic disadvantage, neither is fully satisﬁed with greater inclusion alone. Justice in both cases, is an activity of struggle that radically transforms the social and spatial relations constitutive of transit, and in so doing, generates greater conditions for equity and freedom. Free Transit Toronto and Black Lives Matter illuminate transit systems as forms of control but also as essential sites of resistance. They position infrastructure as an important lever of social change and suggest that mobilizing for mobility is essential to eﬀecting justice. While transit is undoubtedly a site of varied and sometimes contradictory desires the centrality of transit to urbanism and urban life make it a notable platform for organizing. 7 Practically speaking, transit activism may have the potential to unite disparate groups within the city, bringing together coalitions of civil rights, environmental, labour and anti-poverty advocates. In an era where multi- ple forms of mass transit are coming to the fore as complements and/or replacements to the automobile, transit activism will no doubt be even more crucial to ensure justice in the mobility transition. Although the question of scale is beyond the scope of this paper it should also be noted that both FTT and BLM raise the issue of how to locate transit justice across local, urban, or planetary relations, and how to mobilize across diﬀerent concerns and demands in diﬀerent locations. Listening to the concrete demands of those who have been deprived is an important starting point for devising equitable public policies. Moreover, insofar as they provide expansive visions of meaningfully diﬀerent societies, social movements like BLM and FTT actualize forms of justice that do not yet exist, but are in the process of coming into being. In this sense, they exemplify the sort of radical imagination and practice that can enliven academic accounts of transport justice. Notes 1. Whereas ‘transit equity’ is the term most frequently employed in planning discourses, ‘transport justice’ tends to dominate the academic literature. Activist organizations, including those considered here, utilize both ‘transit equity’ and ‘transit justice’ in their campaigns. For the purposes of this article, a distinction is made between transit equity concerning the redistribution of goods and transit justice, implicating other dimensions of equality and freedom. Transit justice will be treated as an instance of transport justice (entailing diﬀerent transportation modes). 2. Several recent works on transport justice have productively engaged the Capabilities Approach, for example, to demonstrate the broad way that transit conditions life chances (see especially Hananel and Berechman 2016; Pereira, Schwanen, and Banister 2017). Yet the solutions these authors provide tend to focus on improving transit policy based individualized measures of travel time, aﬀordability, and access, missing the full extent of relationships that comprise mobility and the social movements deﬁning justice goals in practice. 3. When the GTWA disbanded in 2015, the Free and Accessible Transit Campaign decided to continue as an independent organization, taking on the new name Free Transit Toronto. In recognition of this continuity, this paper refers to both organizations. 4. These movements – as complex webs of people, ideas, and institutions – are themselves already engaged in dialogue with justice scholarship. This paper is meant to complement these activities and to join this conversation by identifying some lessons (my own framing) that might be useful for transport equity scholars. 5. The arguments here about transport justice are largely in line with Sheller’s(2017, 2018) formulation of mobility justice. While my focus is admittedly urban, I use transport here as a platform and a perspective from which to view mobility relations more generally. However, whereas Sheller argues that ‘mobility justice’ is MOBILITIES 677 a distinct concept that overcomes the limitations of both transport and spatial justice, I suggest here, in a slightly diﬀerent way, that a generous reading of both transport and spatial justice, derived in part from social movements themselves, can give rise to the mobile ontology and global interrelationships she advocates. 6. It is this emphasis on the production of space and subjects that distinguishes formulations of spatial justice from the notion of the ‘just city’ (Fainstein 2010). While Fainstein’s arguments are extremely useful for unpacking various dimensions of justice and their often competing orientations, her account does not go far enough to consider the unique considerations of mobility, nor does it (like transport justice accounts based on the Capabilities Approach) challenge fundamental production systems. 7. It should be noted that ‘justice,’ even for the movements in question is not ﬁxed or universal but is worked through in practice. One can imagine many signiﬁcant conﬂicts in struggles over transit space – including struggles among activists themselves. These internal tensions make ﬁnding one-size ﬁts all solutions particu- larly daunting and dangerous. Disclosure statement No potential conﬂict of interest was reported by the author.
