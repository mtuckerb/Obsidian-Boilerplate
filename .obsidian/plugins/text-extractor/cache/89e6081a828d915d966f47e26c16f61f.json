Tucker BradfordDepartment of Social Work, University of Southern MaineSWO-201: Intro to Social WorkPaul JohnsonApril 6, 2025In the Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down Anne Fadiman recounts thestory of a culture clash between the Hmong people's view of health, community,and wellbeing, and the dominant western perspective held by the doctors andstaff at Merced Community Health Center, the State of California, and ValleyChildren's Hospital. Fadiman presents a cautionary tale for any kind of provider(health, welfare, social worker, etc.) working in a cross-cultural context, as wellas specific recommendations to improve outcomes.When the Lees first brought Lia into the US Health system (via MCHC),neither the Lees, nor the staff at MCHC were sufficiently informed about theother's culture or \"explanatory model\" (Fadiman, 260), and the resulting lack ofempathy and deference (on both sides of the divide) culminated in dramatic andtragic consequences for Lia.One of the key issues that created escalation for Lia's condition was amisalignment of the perception of the intensity and duration of Lia's problemwithin her client system. The Lee family believed that Lia's condition was aspiritual matter with an acute physical component. In their eyes, the only problemto be solved was the intensity of the current seizure, not the condition of epilepsy(which was considered to be a path to shamanism):The medical system believed that Lia suffered from a chronic condition(epilepsy) which could be managed to mitigate brain damage and othercomplications. With one notable exception (Dr Kleinman) the client system wasaligned congruent with their cultural context.Because of this misalignment, the client system was not acting in harmonyto address Lia's condition. Lia's family initially sought the help of the medicalsystem to alieviate the immediate problem of a sustained seizure, Neil andYou should give Lia medicine to take for a week but no longer. Aftershe is well, she should stop taking the medicine. You should not treat herby taking her blood or the fluid from her backbone. Lia should also betreated at home with our Hmong medicines and by sacrificing pigs andchickens. We hope Lia will be healthy, but we are not sure we want her tostop shaking forever because it makes her noble in our culture, and whenshe grows up she might become a shaman. (Fadiman, 260)Peggy addressed the seizure as best they could, but did not have the capacity orinterest to understand the Lee's cultural beliefs about their daughter's condition.Consequently the medical system attempted to treat Lia with medicines andmedical interventions, while the Lee family continued to attempt a spirituallyaligned solution (sacrifices, poultices, etc.). Eventually this conflict came to ahead when the Lee family made their own decisions about how and which drugsto administer, and the medical system—in concert with the state—insisted oncompliance, ultimately separating Lia from her family. Later, Niel would reflect onthat with regret:The impact of Lia's condition was carried, to greater and lesser degrees byevery member of the client system. Fua and Nao, of course, had to watch theirbeloved daughter (and prospective spiritual guide) decline into a vegetativestate, while also being harried by the medical and welfare and court system. Lia'ssiblings were marginalized and neglected due to the enormity of Lia's condition,and the response of the client system to that condition. The primary carephysicians (Neil and Peggy) felt crushing responsibility, stress, and burnout asthey fought against both the epilepsy and the Hmong culture. Lia's foster family,the doctors, residents, and nurses, and even some of her social workers were allcited to have been significantly impacted by their interaction with and support ofLia.While all of the support providers strived, struggled, and suffered in pursuitof the best outcome for Lia, the client's perception of the social work interventionremained decidedly negative. Lia's family failed to appreciate the methods andprocess of the western medical system, and the medical system failed tounderstand the strengths, beliefs, and wisdom of Lia's family culture. Lia's familybelieved that, at its core, Lia's condition was of spiritual origin, and the physicalI wish I'd accepted that it would be easier for the family to comply withone medicine instead of three, even if three seemed medically optimal[…]Lia taught me that when there is a very dense cultural barrier, you do thebest you can, and if something happens despite that, you have to besatisfied with little successes instead of total successes. You have to giveup total control. That is very hard for me, but I do try. (Fadmian. 257)embodiment was merely a thing to be mitigated to reduce Lia's suffering. Thechronic aspect of Lia's condition was, to the Lee family and the Hmong people, asign of divinity and it would be absurd to try to eliminate it. The medical systemwas unable to perceive this nuance, due in part to language barriers, and in partto a ethnocentricity that prevented them from seeing the value of the Hmongbelief system.Because of these discrepancies, the client system was sociallydysfunctional. In retrospect it is no surprise that one of the worst possibleoutcomes was realized. Without mutual understanding, a respectful leveling ofexpectations and process, and empathy, any social system will perform sub-optimally. In Lia's case, all of these factors were at a critically low point.As social workers, the lesson this story presents is deeply impactful. We canlearn from this cautionary tale, that each party in the client system has uniquestrengths that would be instrumental in creating better outcomes for the client.For example, the Lee family was incredibly caring and devoted to Lia, and in factsaw her as a potential shaman. They could be counted on to do what theythought was in Lia's best interest, no matter the cost or impact to them or theirfamily. The medical system had deep knowledge of epilepsy and effectivetreatments. If they could find a course of treatment that felt respectful to theHmong values and objectives, the Lee family would certainly have embraced it—as they eventually did: \"[…]when she returned from foster care, Foua and NaoKao had given Lia her medicine--4 ccs of Depakene, three times a day--exactlyas prescribed. (Fadiman, 254)\"It is a testament to our profession that Jeannine Hilt—Lia's social worker—did think to ask the important questions, and facilitated getting support for Liaand her family and, eventually facilitated the reunion of Lia with her family, aswell as a simplified (and acceptable) drug treatment plan. Lia's primary careproviders—Neil Ernst and Peggy Philp—on the other hand, were aloof andethnocentric (described by the author as Olympian). Jeannie recognized that Liawould be better off with her family and worked with compassion and empathy tobring the two sets of conflicting values into harmony. Jeannie valued culturalsensitivity, the assumption of good intent, and the assumption competence. Neiland Peggy valued the certainty of their medical knowledge and using thatknowledge to help people. When that came into conflict with patient compliance,they had trouble reconciling the competing values.Of course, there were ethical dilemmas in Lia's situation and treatment. Themedical profession has clear ethical guidelines for treatment of patients. In orderfor Neil and Peggy to feel that they were doing their best to provide an equalstandard of care for their Hmong patients, they felt compelled to insist on thesame standard of care that they gave all of their patients. This included optimalmedical and pharmaceutical intervention.The Lee family, on the other hand was bound by the ethics of theircommunity which put family, and the spiritual world in the fore. Fadimanillustrated the Hmong values of care and a ritual deference to the spiritual world,that was valued higher than life extension. Fadiman provides several examplesincluding how a Hmong person believes that living with a treatable deformity,would be preferable to the consequences of not accepting that deformity.This lack of \"conjoint treatment\" may have been the core conflict betweenthe Lee's and the rest of the client system. For the dominant culture of America,there is an extremely high value put on duration and quality of life. For theA decade ago, that is not the way Neil looked at the situation. Henever seriously considered lowering his standard of care. His job, as hesaw it, was to practice good medicine; the Lees' job was to comply.(Fadiman, 78-9)A child in San Diego was born with a harelip. Her doctors asked theparents' permission to repair it surgically. They cited the ease of theoperation, the social ostracism to which the child would otherwise becondemned. Instead, the parents fled the hospital with their baby. Severalyears earlier, while the family was escaping from Laos to Thailand, thefather had killed a bird with a stone, but he had not done so cleanly, andthe bird had suffered. The spirit of that bird had caused the harelip. Torefuse to accept the punishment would be a grave insult. (Fadiman, 262)Hmong people it seems, there was a higher value put on equilibrium with theirphysical and spiritual ecosystem. It would be incredibly hard to reconcile thedifference in this core set of values, even if the parties had been able to see itthat way. Further, the Hmong people saw physical health and spiritual heath asinterrelated but separable. Spiritual intervention should be the first course ofaction, but if that doesn't work, treating the physical condition is totallyacceptable. Here, Fadiman shows a perfect illustration of how a San Diegofamily chose not to treat their child's harelip:This book has underscored the absolute imperative that cultural awarenessand sensitivity is as critical to the effective care of a client/patient as are thestandard interventions of the client system. At the conclusion, Fadiman presentsthree suggestion for how pediatricians [caregivers] should approach situations ofcultural differences. These suggestions reduce to:If I had the opportunity to work in a client system with the Hmong people, Iwould insist on having a cultural interpreter to guide me. I would want to knowwhat specific observances, beliefs, customs, and mannerisms were required toachieve the goals that we intended to achieve. I would, in short, strive toimplement \"a little medicine and a little neeb\" (Fadiman, 266)Treatment Plan : The Neng performed a ceremony during whichhealing powers [were] bestowed on water which was then used to washthe painful area in order to release the pain. However, the pain persistedand the client accepted that it was not a spiritual problem. He thenreturned to the physician and consented to surgery. (Fadiman, 269)1. \"Get rid of the term [concept of] 'compliance'[…] it implies moral hegemony\"2. \"Focus on mediation[…] Decide what is critical and be willing to compromiseon everything else\"3. Understand the influence that culture (both yours and theirs) has on both theoutcomes and the process for achieving them (paraphrased)(Fadiman, 261)I have had some personal experience with this approach. I worked for theSETI Institute in a technology leadership role from 2000-2011. During my tenure,we were gifted a large chunk of developer time from a company called InfoSys.Our team was in Bangalore. SETI engineers (under a grant) workedunsuccessfully with the Bangalore team for months. I was brought in to advise,and identified that there was something that I could not reconcile about thissituation. Everyone seemed to be trying their best, but nothing was happening;no code was being written and communication had stalled. I read a book aboutSouth Indian cultural beliefs that was written by a cultural interpreter. Followingthe advice of that author, I went to Bangalore, had tea with the team, askedabout their family and shared stories of mine. The meeting took a few hours.They gave me a tour (their pride evident at every stop), we ate together, and saidour goodbyes. The next week, code started flowing in. For the Bangalore team,there was a specific set of rituals to perform before commencing work withsomeone, until we had observed those ritual steps, no amount of effort wouldyield progress.\"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down\" both troubled and comfortedme. My reaction to MCMC staff at the beginning of the book was disturbed,disquieted and concerned. It seemed clear that Lia was headed in a baddirection, and the author did little to diminish that foreshadowing. When Lia's BigEvent happened and the book still had quite a few pages to the right, I washopeful. In the end, the hope I maintain was not for Lia—though I think I havecome to a comfortable place with her, based on a new cultural understanding—but for future cross-cultural interactions.Last night I had dinner with my daughter and her friend (they/them). Herfriend is considering pre-med next year, and I brought this book up anddiscussed some of the topic with them. It was clear from that conversation thatthis book might provide them with some citations to point to in a paper, but thattheir cultural sensitivity was already sufficiently refined and informed, that theywould be unlikely to repeat the follies of Neil, Peggy, and the health and welfaresystem of California. This gives me hope.For my part, I hope to continue to be exposed to new etymologies andepistemologies as my career progresses. I would like to be resourced with time,exposure, clients, and colleagues who are willing to share their perspectives withme, so that I can better serve people who come from different cultural and socialcontexts. In a situation like Lia's, I would want to bring together elders, parents,the medical team, and a cultural interpreter, to understand what was possiblewithin the confines of the joint ethical/values systems, and form an agreementthat plays to the greatest strengths of the client system. Through the reading ofFadiman's accounting of Lia's client system, I am motivated and inspired toconduct my career with curiosity, awareness, and deference to the client'sexplanatory model, while simultaneously maintaining the unique strengths of myown.LEE FAMILY GENOGRAMLee Family Genogram.pngLIA LEI ECOMAPLee Family Ecomap.pngWORKS CITEDFadiman, A.
