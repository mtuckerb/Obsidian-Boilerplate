You hear a lot of giggling and squealing. When you open the door to check on the kids, you find them sitting on the floor with their panties off, pointing at and touching each other’s genitals. What do you do? Every day, parents around the world are faced with situations like this. Being caught off-guard by young children’s self-exploration and curiosity about body parts and sexual issues is one of the uncomfortable realities of parenting, and can raise a host of troubling questions, such as, “Is my child normal?” “Should I be worried?” “What should I say?” Although talking with children about bodily changes and sexual matters may feel awkward, providing children with accurate, age-appropriate information is one of the most important things parents can do to make sure children grow up safe, healthy, and secure in their bodies. Sexual Development and Behavior in Young Children: The Basics Like all forms of human development, sexual development begins at birth. Sexual development includes not only the physical changes that occur as children grow, but also the sexual knowledge and beliefs they come to learn and the behaviors they show. Any given child’s sexual knowledge and behavior is strongly influenced by: The child’s age ■ 1-3 What the child observes (including the ■ sexual behaviors of family and friends) 4 What the child is taught (including cultural ■ and religious beliefs concerning sexuality and physical boundaries) “Young people do not wake up on their thirteenth birthday, somehow transformed into a sexual being overnight. Even young children are sexual in some form.” 5 Heather Coleman, PhD & Grant Charles, PhD University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada and The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C. In partnership with: caringforK DS: Sexual Development and Behavior in Children - Information for Parents & Caregivers April 2009 Very young and preschool-aged children (four or younger) are naturally immodest, and may display open—and occasionally startling--curiosity about other people’s bodies and bodily functions, such as touching women’s breasts, or wanting to watch when grownups go to the bathroom. Wanting to be naked (even if others are not) and showing or touching private parts while in public are also common in young children. They are curious about their own bodies and may quickly discover that touching certain body parts feels nice. (For more on what children typically do at this and other ages, see Table 1.) As children age and interact more with other children (approximately ages 4–6), they become more aware of the differences between boys and girls, and more social in their exploration. In addition to exploring their own bodies through touching or rubbing their private parts (masturbation), they may begin “playing doctor” and copying adult behaviors such as kissing and holding hands. As children become increasingly aware of the social rules governing sexual behavior and language (such as the importance of modesty or which words are considered “naughty”), they may try to test these rules by using naughty words. They may also ask more questions about sexual matters, such as where babies come from, and why boys and girls are physically different. (For more, see Table 1.) Table 1: Common Sexual Behaviors in Childhood 1, 3, 6Age Uncommon/Problematic Behaviors Preschool children (less than 4 years) Exploring and touching private parts, in public and in private ■ Rubbing private parts (with hand or against objects) ■ Showing private parts to others ■ Trying to touch mother’s or other women’s breasts ■ Removing clothes and wanting to be naked ■ Attempting to see other people when they are naked or undressing (such as in the ■ bathroom) Asking questions about their own—and others’—bodies and bodily functions ■ Talking to children their own age about bodily functions such as “poop” and “pee” ■ Young Children (approximately 4-6 years) Purposefully touching private parts (masturbation), occasionally in the presence of others ■ Attempting to see other people when they are naked or undressing ■ Mimicking dating behavior (such as kissing, or holding hands) ■ Talking about private parts and using “naughty” words, even when they don’t understand ■ the meaning Exploring private parts with children their own age (such as “playing doctor”, “I’ll show you ■ mine if you show me yours,” etc.) School-Aged Children (approximately 7-12 years) Purposefully touching private parts (masturbation), usually in private ■ Playing games with children their own age that involve sexual behavior (such as “truth or ■ dare”, “playing family,” or “boyfriend/girlfriend”) Attempting to see other people naked or undressing ■ Looking at pictures of naked or partially naked people ■ Viewing/listening to sexual content in media (television, movies, games, the Internet, ■ music, etc.) Wanting more privacy (for example, not wanting to undress in front of other people) and ■ being reluctant to talk to adults about sexual issues Beginnings of sexual attraction to/interest in peers ■ 2 The National Child Traumatic Stress Network www.NCTSN.org Once children enter grade school (approximately ages 7–12), their awareness of social rules increases and they become more modest and want more privacy, particularly around adults. Although self touch (masturbation) and sexual play continue, children at this age are likely to hide these activities from adults. Curiosity about adult sexual behavior increases—particularly as puberty approaches—and children may begin to seek out sexual content in television, movies, and printed material. Telling jokes and “dirty” stories is common. Children approaching puberty are likely to start displaying romantic and sexual interest in their peers. (For more, see Table 1.) Although parents often become concerned when a child shows sexual behavior, such as touching another child’s private parts, these behaviors are not uncommon in developing children. Most sexual play is an expression of children’s natural curiosity and should not be a cause for concern or alarm. In general, “typical” childhood sexual play and exploration: Occurs between children who play together regularly and know each other well ■ Occurs between children of the same general age and physical size ■ Is spontaneous and unplanned ■ Is infrequent ■ Is voluntary (the children agreed to the behavior, none of the involved children seem ■ uncomfortable or upset) Is easily diverted when parents tell children to stop and explain privacy rules ■ Some childhood sexual behaviors indicate more than harmless curiosity, and are considered sexual behavior problems. Sexual behavior problems may pose a risk to the safety and well-being of the child and other children. (For more on this topic, see the National Child Traumatic Stress Network’s factsheet, Understanding and Coping with Sexual Behavior Problems in Children: Information for Parents and Caregivers at http://nctsn.org/nctsn_assets/pdfs/caring/sexualbehaviorproblems.pdf.) Sexual behavior problems include any act that: Is clearly beyond the child’s developmental stage (for example, ■ a three-year-old attempting to kiss an adult’s genitals) Involves threats, force, or aggression ■ Involves children of widely different ages or abilities (such as ■ a 12-year-old “playing doctor” with a four-year-old) Provokes strong emotional reactions in the child—such as ■ anger or anxiety Responding to Sexual Behaviors Situations like the one described at the beginning of this handout can be unsettling for parents. However, these situations also offer excellent opportunities to assess how much children understand and to teach important information about sexual matters. The first step is to try to figure out what actually happened. To do this, it’s important to stay calm. Staying calm will allow you to make clear decisions about what you say and/or do, rather than acting on strong emotions. 3 caringforK DS: Sexual Development and Behavior in Children - Information for Parents & Caregivers April 2009 Coping with Your Own Reactions To remain composed, try taking a long, deep breath, counting to ten, or even closing the door and stepping away for a couple of minutes before saying anything. In the case described above, a parent might calmly tell the children that it’s time to get dressed and then ask each child to go to a different room in the house. After taking a few moments to collect his or her thoughts—and to consult with a spouse or partner if feeling very unsettled— the parent could then talk to each child one-on-one. When talking to children about sexual behaviors, it’s important to maintain a calm and even tone of voice and to ask open-ended questions as much as possible, so the children can tell what happened in their own words, rather than just answering yes or no. So, in this case, a parent might ask each child: What were you doing? ■ How did you get the idea? ■ How did you learn about this? ■ How did you feel about doing it? ■ In the opening scenario, all of the children involved were about the same age, had been playmates for some time, and seemed to be enjoying their game. So, it’s likely the children were just curious and playing around and that no one was upset about what happened. If you encounter a situation where the children are a little embarrassed but otherwise not distressed, this can present an ideal opportunity for teaching the children about healthy boundaries and rules about sexual behavior. Educating Children about Sexual Issues Just because a behavior is typical doesn’t mean the behavior should be ignored. Often, when children participate in sexual behavior it indicates that they need to learn something. Teach what the child needs to know, given the situation. In this case, for example, the parent might teach the children that it’s okay to be curious about other people’s bodies, but that private parts should be kept private, even with friends. Although children usually respond well when parents take the time to give them correct information and answer their questions, it is important to provide information that is appropriate to the child’s age and developmental level. In Table 2, you will find an overview of some of the most important information and safety messages for children of various ages. Keep in mind that you do not need to bombard children with information all at once. Let the situation—and the child’s questions—guide the lessons you share. The important thing is to let children know that you are ready to listen and to answer whatever questions they may have. Too often, children get the majority of their sexual education from other children and from media sources such as television shows, songs, movies, and video games. Not only is this information often wrong, it may have very little to do with sexual values that parents want to convey. Explicit adult sexual activities are sometimes found during “family time” television shows, in commercials, and on cartoon/children’s channels, and can have an influence on children’s behaviors. Controlling media exposure and providing appropriate alternatives is an important part of teaching children about sexual issues. Get to know the rating systems of games, movies, and television shows and make use of the parental controls available through many internet, cable, and satellite providers. Myth: Talking about sex with my children will just encourage them to become sexually active. Fact: In a recent survey of American teens, 9 out of 10 teens said it would be easier to delay sexual activity and prevent unwanted pregnancy if they were able to have “more open, honest conversations” with their parents on these topics.7 When you talk honestly with your children about sexual issues, you can give them the knowledge and skills they need to keep safe and to make good decisions about relationships and intimacy. 4 The National Child Traumatic Stress Network www.NCTSN.org However, don’t assume that just by activating those controls you will be taking care of the situation. It’s very important for you to be aware of what your children are watching on television and online, and make time to watch television with them. When appropriate, you can use this time as a springboard to talk about sexual or relationship issues, and to help children develop the skills to make healthy decisions about their behavior and relationships.
