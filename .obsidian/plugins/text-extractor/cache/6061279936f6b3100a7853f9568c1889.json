Please Note: As demonstrated in the lesson, part b of these problems must be done by calculating the minimum and/or maximum usual for comparison. 1) Mars Incorporated claims that 14% of its plain m&m candies are yellow. A sample of 100 plain m&mâ€™s are selected. a) Find the mean and standard deviation for the number of yellow candies in such a group of 100. b) If a group of 100 is found to have 8 yellow candies, is that an unusually low amount? You must use the process that is detailed in the lesson. 2) A student is unprepared for a multiple-choice quiz with 10 questions and all their answers are random guesses. Each question has 5 possible answers and only one is correct, so they have one chance in 5 of getting any given question correct. a) Find the mean and standard deviation for the number of correct answers for such a student. b) Would it be unusual for this type of guessing student to get at least 7 right? Why or why not? You must use the process that is detailed in the lesson.

In standard English text, the letter h is used at a rate of 6%. a) Find the mean and standard deviation for the number of times the letter h will be found on a typical page of 2,600 characters. b) An intercepted page of 2,600 characters is found to have the letter h occurring 128 times. Is 128 unusually low? You must use the process that is detailed in the lesson. Page of 2 2","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
