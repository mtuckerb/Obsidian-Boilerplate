I didn't previously understand Atherosclerosis, and how it worked against overall heart and brain health. I am grateful to finally understand what systolic and diastolic blood pressure are, as I've often wondered about those numbers. I enjoyed what Kristin Neff said about the centrality of Common Humanity being critically important for self-compassion. If she hadn't contrasted it with Isolation, I think I might have missed her point. I have been practicing \"being with my suffering\" for a little over a year now, and have found it's incredible power to improve my resilience. It was good to hear her reminder to not go directly into problem- solving mode! I loved your \"Tender vs Fierce\" self-compassion. I think I have favored the later in the past, but now that I've seen that there is a choice there, and understand what that choice means, I really look forward to giving myself more Tender self-compassion, going forward. I feel my mindfulness practice has improved significantly this week. I had a very stressful week full of joys (youngest graduating from HS, my birthday) and trials (literally), which made this a perfect week to have an extra focus on self-compassion. It's wonderful when the events align like this! 1 / 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
