This particular normal curve is the Standard Normal curve. Note the top of the curve is labeled = 1. This indicates that the standard deviation for this distribution equals 1. The label, = 0, at the bottom of the curve, indicates that the mean for this distribution equals 0. = 1 = 0 To give you a general sense of the Normal Distribution, consider the curve below. Note that the mean is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. This is the normal distribution for IQ. Consider the area, the space, under this normal curve. The total area under the curve is equal to 1. That area of 1 represents the total probability, also equal to 1. Average IQ is 100. 50% of people have an IQ less than 100, and 50% of people have an IQ over 100. There is a 100% chance, probability of 1, that a randomly selected person’s IQ is either above or below 100. Half the probability, also half the area, is below the mean and the other half is above the mean. This is the hallmark of a normal distribution. = 15 = 100 σ μ σ μ σ μ Page of 1 6 Your first task is to learn how to read the z-scores tables. In the next lesson, we will put them to use. These tables are based on the standard normal distribution, where the mean is zero ( = 0) and the standard deviation is one ( = 1). = 1 = 0 There is a negative and a positive z-scores table. These two tables are in the file named “z-scores tables” that came with this assignment. You need the tables at hand now for reference. Consider the standard normal curve below. Note the 1.27 label at the bottom. That 1.27 is a z-score. Z-scores are numbers at the bottom of the normal curve. = 1 1.27 The total area under the curve is equal to 1. That area of 1 represents the total probability, also equal to 1. The shaded region from 1.27 to the left tail has an area of less than 1. The shaded region represents a probability of less than 1. That shaded area equals the probability of less than 1.27. To find the probability, we find the area. We find the area in the z-tables. To determine the amount of shaded area under the curve requires math beyond the scope of this course. That is why we have the z-tables. We will take the z-score of 1.27 to the table and find the area from the left tail up to the boundary marked by 1.27. The areas from the tables are ALWAYS from the left tail up. μ σ σ μ σ Page of 2 6 1.27 EXAMPLE 1: Let’s take our z of positive 1.27 to the positive z-scores table. Find the little z in the upper left-hand column of the table. Float down that column to 1.2 Float across the top of the table to 0.07 [1.2 + 0.07 = 1.27] At the intersection of that row and column, you will find 0.8980. 0.8980 is the area from the left tail up to the 1.27 boundary. 0.8980 is the probability of less than 1.27. z 0.07 1.2 0.8980 EXAMPLE 2: Page of 3 6 What is the probability of less than -0.68? -0.68 We take our z of -0.68 to the negative z-scores table. Go down the first column to -0.6. Go across the top to 0.08. At the intersection, we find 0.2483. The probability of less than -0.68 is 0.2483 or 24.83%, call it 25%. Restated, 25% of the area is shaded. 75% is not shaded. 25% chance of less than -0.68. 75% chance of more than -0.68. EXAMPLE 3: Page of 4 6 What is the probability of more than 1.18? Take the z of 1.18 to the table and you find an area, thus a probability, of 0.8810. As always, that table value is the area from the left tail up to 1.18. 0.8810 1.18 But we want the probability of MORE than 1.18. The total probability is 1. The probability left of the boundary at 1.18 is 0.8810. The probability to the right of (more than) 1.18 must equal 1 - 0.8810 = 0.1190. 1.18 The probability of MORE than 1.18 is 0.1190. EXAMPLE 4: Page of 5 6 1 – 0.8810 = 0.1190 What is the probability of between -1.02 and 1.35? -1.02 1.35 The total area under the normal curve is 1. We need to find the amount of that area that is trapped between the boundaries at -1.02 and 1.35. That trapped area equals the probability between our two z-scores. The areas we retrieve from the z-scores tables are always the areas from the left tail up to the given z-score. We will take the z of 1.35 to the table and find the area up to the 1.35 boundary. Then we will take the z of -1.02 to the table and find the area up to the -1.02 boundary. Subtracting the smaller area from the larger will give us the chunk of area we want. -1.02 1.35 From the tables: The probability (area) of less than 1.35 is 0.9115 The probability (area) of less than -1.02 is 0.1539 We now subtract. 0.9115 minus 0.1539 equals 0.7576. The probability of between -1.02 and 1.35 is 0.7576. Restated, 76% of the area, thus 76% of the probability is between -1.02 and 1.35. Page of 6 6","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
