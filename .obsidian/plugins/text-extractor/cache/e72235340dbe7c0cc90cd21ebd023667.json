I will be the attorney primarily responsible for the representation. My current rate is $425/hour. Advance Payment. The Firm requests a Retainer in the amount of $5,000.00.

Please review them carefully and let us know if you have any questions. “We,” “our,” and “us” refer to Murray, Plumb & Murray. “You” or “client” refers to the Client defined in the Representation Letter. 1. Identity of Clients. We represent only the person(s) or entity(ies) identified as clients in our Representation Letter and nobody else unless explicitly agreed in writing. Our representation begins when the Representation Letter has been returned to us, fully executed. 2. Attorney-Client Privilege. The attorney-client privilege allows you to keep your communications with us confidential. This privilege includes verbal, written, and electronic communications and encompasses not only the lawyers at Murray, Plumb & Murray, but staff members as well. However, if you share any of our communications with any other person, then the privilege may be broken and confidentiality may no longer apply. Please refrain from discussing lawyer-client communications with any third party in any form. If a situation arises in which you believe it is necessary to share such information with a third party, please consult with us before doing so. 3. Privacy. We like to use this opportunity to confirm our policies regarding the privacy of client information. Attorneys have been and continue to be bound by professional ethics rules of confidentiality. We will abide by those rules which protect your rights to privacy. Murray Plumb & Murray does not disclose any non-public personal information about our clients or former clients except as required by law, or as authorized by the client. In order to protect all non-public personal information, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with legal professional standards. 4. Fees. Unless set forth otherwise in the representation letter, our fees are based on our hourly rates. Those rates are based on the experience of the professionals and the nature of the representation and are subject to change without notice, usually on an annual basis. 5. Your Duties. You agree to provide all relevant information to us, to cooperate, to keep us informed of any information or developments which may come to your attention, to abide by this Agreement, to pay our bills promptly upon receipt, and to keep us advised of any changes to your address, email address, or telephone number. 6. Expenses and Third-Party Charges. In addition to our fees, you also must pay for any additional expenses and third-party charges incurred as part of our representation of you. These expenses include (but are not limited to) travel, couriers, postage, legal Docusign Envelope ID: 8E1153FA-C893-4805-B962-3192BF864134 and title research, copies, court costs, filing and recording fees, and court reporter costs. You are directly responsible for the cost of any expert or other third party hired as part of our representation, and we ask that such invoices be paid promptly to preserve our good relationship with those professionals. Your invoice will also include a percentage charge (currently 2.5% of legal fees billed, but subject to change) for technology services and cost recovery. 7. Terms of Payment. We will bill you on a monthly basis and ask that you make payment promptly. All amounts owed to us are due, and you agree to pay such amounts, within thirty (30) days of receipt of our invoice. We reserve the right without notice to assess a late fee of 1.5% per month on all overdue balances. We reserve the right to stop work and/or terminate our representation of you for failure to comply with your obligations under the Representation Letter or these Standard Terms, including any failure to make payment when due. 8. Escrow Deposits. Any funds we receive from you to be held in escrow will be placed in our client trust account for your benefit. You hereby grant us a first-priority security interest in any such funds. These funds will be held by us in pledge and as security for your past, present, and future obligations to us. Unless we otherwise agree, your funds will be placed in a pooled trust account and you will not be paid interest on them. By court rule, interest earned on the pooled account is payable to a charitable foundation. Please contact us to discuss the possibility of a different arrangement if desired. 9. Estimates. We often provide estimates of the cost of representation. Because every case is different and the legal costs may be affected by the actions of third parties, it is impossible to accurately predict the cost of representation. Please understand that any estimate is not a maximum or fixed quote. The final cost of representation may be higher or lower than any estimate. 10. Electronic Correspondence. You agree to receive correspondence and invoices from us by email. Due to security and retention concerns, please do not communicate with us by text message unless we agree otherwise. From time to time, we also may send you informational emails or mailings. These communications may come after our representation of you ends and do not create an ongoing attorney-client relationship. 11. Termination of Representation. You may terminate our representation at any time, with or without cause, by notifying us in writing. We also reserve the right to terminate our representation of you at any time, with or without cause, but subject to our obligations under the applicable rules and court requirements. Any termination of our representation does not affect your responsibility for payment, including additional charges incurred in connection with an orderly transition of the matter. Docusign Envelope ID: 8E1153FA-C893-4805-B962-3192BF864134 12. Disposition of Documents. Upon termination of our representation of you, we will return any documents or other data belonging to you upon request or if required by applicable rule or law. Otherwise, we will retain them in compliance with applicable rules and then destroy them, unless otherwise required by applicable rule or law. At our discretion, we may retain files in hard copy or electronic form. 13. Fee Disputes. If you ever question or disagree with the amount of our fee, please discuss the matter with the principal lawyer handling your representation or the managing director. If there is a fee dispute that is not readily resolved, you have the right to request arbitration under supervision of the applicable bar association. Upon request, we will provide you with information about the applicable procedures. We also agree to participate in nonbinding mediation and will pay one-half of the cost of hiring an independent, experienced mediator to assist in seeking a voluntary resolution of any dispute. 14. Changes to these Terms. The terms set forth here and in our representation letter may be changed only in writing (including email) agreed to by both parties.
