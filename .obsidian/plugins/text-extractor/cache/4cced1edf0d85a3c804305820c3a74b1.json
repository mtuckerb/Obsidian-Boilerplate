Page 2 of 8Monday, September 9, 2024 NOTICE OF YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE FEDCAP/DHHS PROGRAM - IMPORTANT INFORMATION The Fedcap Program helps people who get TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) with training, child care, transportation and other support When Can I Work With Fedcap? You must work with Fedcap if you want to get TANF benefits. You must work with Fedcap if your children are 1 year old or older, or you are a teen parent and don't have a high school diploma or high school equivalency. Some people, such as SSI recipients and VISTA volunteers, do not have to work with Fedcap. People who must work with Fedcap are called \"mandatory participants\". What Do I Have To Do If I Am A Mandatory Participant In Fedcap? If you are a mandatory participant, you must follow the rules of the program. Following the rules includes coming in to meet with Fedcap staff when you are asked, or calling or writing if you cannot come to a meeting. If you do not follow the rules, you and your family may lose all or part of your TANF and your Food Supplement benefits. You can get these benefits back when you start following the rules. If you do not start following the rules you will lose all of your TANF benefits after 90 days. If you do not follow the rules a second time you will lose all of your TANF benefits. The Fedcap staff will explain the rules to you and give you a copy of the rules if you want to read them. What Can I Do If I Don't Agree With Fedcap? If you believe that you have a good reason for not being in Fedcap, you have the right to talk to a supervisor. You also have the right to ask for an Administrative Hearing. You can do this by talking to your Fedcap worker. Tell him or her you want a hearing. In an Administrative Hearing, a hearing officer will listen to you and to Fedcap and decide who is right. At the Administrative Hearing you can represent yourself, have someone else represent you, or have a representative from Pine Tree Legal Assistance represent you. Fedcap can help you contact Pine Tree Legal Assistance. What Are The Time Limits For Me To Appeal An Fedcap Decision? If you want an Administrative Hearing, you must ask for it within 30 days of receiving a letter from Fedcap that you disagree with. If you ask for an Administrative Hearing within 10 days of receiving the letter from Fedcap, and if you so choose, your benefits will continue until the hearing officer makes a decision. If you are appealing the denial of an extension to the 60-month lifetime limit of TANF your benefits will not continue during the appeal period. Can I Volunteer For Fedcap? If you do not have to sign up for Fedcap, you may still volunteer for Fedcap. If you volunteer you are called a \"voluntary participant\" and if you do not follow the rules, you will not lose TANF or Food Supplement benefits, but Fedcap may stop providing you with services. If you are a voluntary participant, you may still have an Administrative Hearing if you disagree with Fedcap.
