The education and training of each party; [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] G. The provisions for retirement and health insurance benefits of each party; [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] H. The tax consequences of the division of marital property, including the tax consequences of the sale of the marital home, if applicable; [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] I. The health and disabilities of each party; [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] J. The tax consequences of a spousal support award; [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] K. The contributions of either party as homemaker; [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] L. The contributions of either party to the education or earning potential of the other party; [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] M. Economic misconduct by either party resulting in the diminution of marital property or income; [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] M-1. Economic abuse by a spouse. For the purposes of this paragraph, \"economic abuse\" has the same meaning as in section 4102, subsection 5; [PL 2023, c. 646, Pt. C, §2 (AMD).] N. The standard of living of the parties during the marriage; [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] O. The ability of the party seeking support to become self-supporting within a reasonable period of time; [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] P.

Real estate and other property; life insurance and other security. The court may order part of the obligated party's real estate or other property, as well as the rents, profits or income from real estate or other property, to be assigned and set out to the other party for life or for such other period determined to be just. The court may also order the obligated party to maintain life insurance or to otherwise provide security for the payment of spousal support in the event the obligation may survive the obligated party's death. [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] 8. Cessation upon death of payee or payor. An order awarding, denying or modifying spousal support may provide that the award survives the death of the payee or payor, or both. Unless otherwise stated in the order awarding spousal support, the obligation to make any payment pursuant to this section ceases upon the death of either the payee or the payor with respect to any payment not yet due and owing as of the date of death. [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] 9. Effect of no award or termination of spousal support. A final judgment that does not award spousal support forever precludes such an award in that action. The complete termination of a spousal support award pursuant to the terms of the award or a final post-judgment order forever precludes the reinstatement of spousal support in that action. [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] 10. Application. This section applies to: A. Orders granting or denying spousal support entered on or after September 1, 2000; and [PL 1999, c. 634, §3 (NEW).] B.

In a proceeding for a divorce, for legal separation or for disposition of property following dissolution of the marriage by a court that lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent spouse or lacked jurisdiction to dispose of the property, the court shall set apart to each spouse the spouse's property and shall divide the marital property in proportions the court considers just after considering all relevant factors, including: A. The contribution of each spouse to the acquisition of the marital property, including the contribution of a spouse as homemaker; [PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt.

B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. E, §2 (AFF).] E. The increase in value of property acquired prior to the marriage and the increase in value of a spouse's nonmarital property as defined in paragraphs A to D. (1) \"Increase in value\" includes: (a) Appreciation resulting from market forces; and (b) Appreciation resulting from reinvested income and capital gain unless either or both spouses had a substantial active role during the marriage in managing, preserving or improving the property. (2) \"Increase in value\" does not include: (a) Appreciation resulting from the investment of marital funds or property in the nonmarital property; (b) Appreciation resulting from marital labor; and (c) Appreciation resulting from reinvested income and capital gain if either or both spouses had a substantial active role during the marriage in managing, preserving or improving the property.

All property acquired by either spouse subsequent to the marriage and prior to a decree of legal separation is presumed to be marital property regardless of whether title is held individually or by the spouses in some form of coownership such as joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entirety or community property. The presumption of marital property is overcome by a showing that the property was acquired by a method listed in subsection 2. [PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. E, §2 (AFF).] 4. Disposition of marital property. If both parties to a divorce action also request the court in writing to order disposition of marital property acquired by either or both of the parties to the divorce prior to January 1, 1972, or nonmarital property owned by the parties to the divorce action, the court shall also order disposition in accordance with subsection 1. [PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. E, §2 (AFF).] 5. Decree contents. If the final divorce decree disposes of real property, it must name the party or parties responsible for preparing and recording the decree of divorce or abstract of the decree and paying the recording fee after the clerk has prepared or approved the abstract. The decree may name different parties to be responsible for different parcels. [PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. E, §2 (AFF).] 6. Nonowner spouse claims. Notwithstanding the actual notice provisions of Title 14, section 4455 or any other laws, a claim of a nonowner spouse to real estate as \"marital property,\" as defined in this section, does not affect title to the real estate of the owner spouse until the nonowner spouse records in the appropriate registry of deeds either: A. A copy of the divorce complaint as filed in court; [PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. E, §2 (AFF).] B. A clerk's certificate of the divorce complaint, as described in Title 14, section 4455, subsection 2; or [PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. E, §2 (AFF).] C. A decree or abstract of the decree as described in this section. [PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt.

After the filing of a divorce complaint under section 901, a nonowner spouse has an inchoate equitable ownership interest, without the need to obtain an attachment, levy or court order, in the individual retirement account or similar plan or contract on account of illness, disability, death, age or length of service of the owner spouse, to the extent the account or plan is either exempt or beyond the reach of an attaching or judgment lien creditor under state or federal law. [PL 2005, c. 298, §1 (NEW).] 7. Decree or abstract as deed. All rights acquired under former Title 19, section 721or 723 on or before December 31, 1971 and all rights acquired under this section by a party in the real estate of the other party are effective against a person when the decree of divorce or an abstract of the decree is filed in the registry of deeds for the county or registry district where the real estate is situated. The decree or abstract, at a minimum, must contain: A. The caption of the case, including the names of the parties, and any changes to the parties' names after the decree; [PL 2003, c. 18, §1 (NEW).] B. The date the judgment is final and the court that issued the decree; [PL 2003, c. 18, §1 (NEW).] C. An adequate description of the real estate, such as by reference to the volume and page number of an instrument recorded in the registry of deeds or the probate court record, or an adequate description by metes and bounds or by reference to the volume and page number of the registry of deeds' records of a survey plan of the property; [PL 2003, c. 18, §1 (NEW).] D. Any provision of the decree intended by the court to constitute an encumbrance against real estate, including any conditions pertaining to the encumbrance, in the verbatim language used by the court. If the abstract does not contain the provision required by this paragraph, an encumbrance may not be considered effective against a 3rd party unless the encumbrance has been memorialized in a separate, duly recorded instrument; and [PL 2003, c. 18, §1 (NEW).] E. A clear statement of the ownership interest of the parties in the real estate intended by the court to result from that decree. [PL 2003, c. 18, §1 (NEW).] An inconsequential failure to provide all the details required pursuant to paragraphs A to E does not create an invalid abstract for purposes of this section. The failure of a party to record the decree or an abstract of the decree within a time period prescribed by former Title 19, section 725does not affect the rights of that party as against the other party or the other party's heirs or devisees. The recording of the decree or abstract of the decree has the force and effect of a quitclaim deed releasing all interest in the real estate described in the decree or abstract of the decree, whether the interest is in fee or by statute. [PL 2003, c. 18, §1 (RPR).] 8. Out-of-state divorce decrees. When a divorce has been granted out of the State, the plaintiff, or the plaintiff's attorney, shall cause a duly authenticated copy of the order to be recorded with the register of deeds in each of the counties where the real estate or any part of the real estate is situated. The appropriate recording fee must be paid prior to the recording. [PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. E, §2 (AFF).] 9. Omitted property. If a final divorce decree fails to set apart or divide marital property over which the court had jurisdiction, the omitted property is deemed held by both parties as tenants in common. On the motion of either party, the court may set aside or divide the omitted property between the parties, as justice may require. [PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. E, §2 (AFF).] MRS Title 19-A, Chapter 29. DIVORCE 14 | Chapter 29. DIVORCE Generated 01.07.2025 10. Companion animals. In the disposition of property pursuant to subsection 1, the court, with respect to a companion animal, shall award ownership of the companion animal to only one party after considering all relevant factors, including, but not limited to: A. The well-being and basic daily needs of the companion animal; [PL 2021, c. 285, §1 (NEW).] B. The amount of time each party has spent with the companion animal during the marriage tending to the companion animal's nutritional, grooming, physical and medical needs; [PL 2021, c. 285, §1 (NEW).] C. The ability of a party to continue to own, support and provide adequate care for the companion animal; [PL 2021, c. 285, §1 (NEW).] D. The emotional attachment of a party to the companion animal; [PL 2021, c. 285, §1 (NEW).] E. The emotional attachment of any child in the household to the companion animal and the benefit to the child of the companion animal's remaining in the primary residence of the child; [PL 2021, c. 285, §1 (NEW).] F. Any domestic violence between the parties or in the household of the parties; and [PL 2021, c. 285, §1 (NEW).] G. Any history of animal abuse or other unsafe conditions for the companion animal. [PL 2021, c. 285, §1 (NEW).] For the purposes of this subsection, \"companion animal\" means an animal kept primarily for companionship rather than as a working animal, service animal or farm animal kept for profit.

Spousal support orders issued or modified by the courts in this State must have a provision for the withholding of income to ensure that withholding as a means of obtaining spousal support is available if arrearages occur. Except as provided in chapter 65, subchapter IV, income withholding against all spousal support obligations ordered by a court within the State must be implemented as follows. A. New orders of spousal support must include a provision withholding the amount of spousal support from the income, regardless of the source, of the person obligated to pay the support. If an existing order of alimony or spousal support does not include a withholding order, the obligee may file a motion to amend the spousal support order to include an order for withholding, which the court shall grant. [PL 1997, c. 433, §1 (NEW); PL 1997, c. 433, §2 (AFF).] B. Each order for withholding must provide for a conspicuous notice to the obligor that withholding may result if the obligor fails to make the spousal support payments and that no withholding may be made until the following conditions are met: (1) Either the obligor requests that income withholding be implemented or the obligee determines that the payments the obligor has failed to make under the spousal support order are at least equal to the amount payable for one month; (2) The obligee serves written notice of the amount of arrearage upon the obligor and informs the obligor that the obligee has procured a court order for income withholding; MRS Title 19-A, Chapter 29. DIVORCE Generated 01.07.2025 Chapter 29. DIVORCE | 15 (3) The obligee mails a copy of the determination of arrearage and a copy of the court's withholding order to the payor of funds; (4) The obligee mails to the Department of Health and Human Services a copy of the determination of arrearage and a copy of the court's withholding order to enable the department to proceed pursuant to subsection 2; and (5) The obligor has a 20-day period, after receiving the notice pursuant to subparagraph (2), to file a motion for determination of arrearages with respect to the amount of spousal support owed and to simultaneously request an ex parte stay of service on the payor of funds until the motion for determination is heard. Any stay issued by the court under this subsection expires in 60 days and may be reissued only upon a showing by the obligor that the obligor has made reasonable efforts to obtain a hearing on the motion for determination of arrearages during the effective period of the stay. [PL 1997, c. 433, §1 (NEW); PL 1997, c. 433, §2 (AFF); PL 2003, c. 689, Pt. B, §6 (REV).] C. An order modifying the amount of spousal support issued after a hearing on a motion to modify spousal support may provide that payments be made outright by withholding. If so, paragraph B does not apply. [PL 1997, c. 433, §1 (NEW); PL 1997, c. 433, §2 (AFF).] D. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the withholding order is binding on the payor of funds once service has been made upon the payor. The payor is liable for any amounts the payor fails to withhold after receiving notice. The payor shall withhold from the income payable to the obligor the amount specified in the order and shall monthly or more frequently remit the amounts withheld to the department. The payor may withhold a $2 processing fee in addition to the amount withheld for support. The amount withheld may not exceed the limitations imposed by section 2356 or by 15 United States Code, Section 1673. An employer who, in contravention of this section, discharges from employment, refuses to employ or takes disciplinary action against any obligor because of the existence of an order and the obligations or additional obligations that it imposes upon the employer is subject to a fine in an amount not to exceed $5,000. [PL 1997, c. 433, §1 (NEW); PL 1997, c. 433, §2 (AFF).] E. When a withholding order is in effect and the obligor's employment is terminated or the periodic payment terminates, the obligor's employer or other payor of funds shall notify the department of the termination within 30 days of the termination date. The notice must include the obligor's home address and the name and address of the obligor's new employer or payor of funds, if known. [PL 1997, c. 433, §1 (NEW); PL 1997, c. 433, §2 (AFF).] F. The order of withholding with regard to a current support obligation must be terminated if: (1) The department is unable to forward funds to the obligee for 3 months; or (2) The spousal support obligation has been eliminated by a subsequent court order. A termination may not occur while an arrearage remains unless other provisions for its repayment have been made. [PL 1997, c. 433, §1 (NEW); PL 1997, c. 433, §2 (AFF).] If the department is unable to forward the funds to the obligee for 3 months the funds must be returned to the obligor and notice must be given to the obligor's employer or other payor to cease withholding.
