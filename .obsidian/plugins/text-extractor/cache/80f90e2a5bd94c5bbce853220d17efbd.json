{"path":"2025/PHI-275 - The Nature of Compassion/Attachments/PHI 275 Syllabus Spring 2025(1) 1.docx","text":"PHI 275 – The Nature of Compassion – online Instructor: Sandra Dutkowsky PhD Office: virtual Office Hours: virtual by appointment Email: Sandra.Dutkowsky@maine.edu Course Description: Whether and how we respond to the suffering of others defines, in many ways, who we are as persons and communities. This course is an investigation into the emotion and compassion and its social role. Drawing upon a wide variety of sources Buddhist scriptures, classical and contemporary philosophical thought, it will address philosophical defenders of the need to cultivate compassion (Rousseau, Schopenhauer, and Adam Smith) as well as thinkers suspicious of this notion (Nietzsche, e.g.). The work of contemporary philosophers–Phillip Hallie and Martha Nussbaum–will also receive close attention. Students will have a chance to think through some important philosophical issues, such as the role of emotions in moral deliberation, the extent to which compassion can be both aided and obstructed by the use of language, and whether there are appropriate limits to compassion – from the course catalogue.

Any breach of academic integrity represents a serious offense. Each student has a responsibility to know the standards of conduct and expectations of academic integrity that apply to academic tasks. Violations of student academic integrity include any actions that attempt to promote or enhance the academic standing of any student by dishonest means. Cheating on an examination, stealing the words or ideas of another (i.e., plagiarism), making statements known to be false or misleading, falsifying the results of one's research, improperly using library materials or computer files, or altering or forging academic records are examples of violations of this policy which are contrary to the academic purposes for which the University exists. Acts that violate academic integrity disrupt the educational process and are not acceptable. Evidence of a violation of the academic integrity policy will normally result in disciplinary action. A copy of the complete policy may be obtained from the Dean of Students Office, online at www.usm.maine.edu/deanofstudents or by calling and requesting a copy at (207) 780-5242. Use of Generative AI: The use of Generative AI is not permitted in this course. Since this is an online course that utilizes writing as the main mode of communication. I am only interested in your own, original writing. If I suspect the use of AI, I will ask you to participate in an alternate of assessment of your understanding – ie Zoom meeting to discuss content. Final Examination/Final Project: It is a USM academic policy that no tests or exams may be scheduled during the last week of classes.
