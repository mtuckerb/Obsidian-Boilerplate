PARAMETER: A numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population. The class average on the exam was an 85. That average is a parameter because data was collected from the entire population of the class. STATISTIC: A numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a sample. A random sample of 8 exam had an average of 85. That average is a statistic because data was collected from a sample of the population of the class. QUANTATIVE DATA: Data consisting of numbers representing measurements or counts. Data we can do math with. Examples: weights, heights, bowling scores, numerical grades. QUALATATIVE DATA: Data consisting of names or labels. Data we cannot do math with. Examples: Social security numbers, yes/no data, colors DISCRETE DATA: The data values are quantitative and countable. Like 1 student, 2 students, 3 students and so on (not 2.78 students). CONTINUOUS DATA: The data values are quantitative and not countable. Like height and, weight. (A person can weigh 152.78 pounds.) Page 2 of 3 THE FOUR LEVELS OF MEASUREMENT: NOMINAL: Data that consists of names, labels, or categories. The data cannot be arranged in some order, like low to high. Examples are yes/no data, colors, and lots of data that uses numerical symbols as identifiers (like phone numbers,& zip codes) with no mathematical meaning. ORDINAL: Data that can be arranged in some order but there is no meaning between the intervals. Grades are an example of ordinal data. You can get a B or a B+, but there is nothing in the middle. INTERVAL: Data has order and meaning between the intervals but there is no natural (meaningful) zero. Examples are time and temperature. Time did not begin a little over 2,000 years ago and a temperature of 0 degrees does not mean the absence of all heat. RATIO: Data has order, meaning between the interval and a natural zero. Examples are height, weight, money, number of apples OBSERVATIONAL STUDY: Occurs when we observe and measure specific characteristics, but we do not attempt to modify the items or individuals being studied. Examples are measuring rainfall, surveys, observing a classroom. EXPERIMENT: Occurs when we apply some treatment and then proceed to measure its effects (if any) on the items or individuals. Examples are drug trials, and crash testing. Page 3 of 3 THE THREE TYPES OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES: RETROSPECTIVE: Data are collected from the past by examination of records, interviews, old newspapers etc. CROSS-SECTIONAL: Data are collected in one specified chunk of time. PROSPECTIVE: Data are collected into the future, over the course of time. FOUR SAMPLING METHODS: RANDOM: Each time a selection is made, all units in the population have the same chance of being selected. Drawing names from a hat is random sampling. SYSTEMATIC: A starting unit is selected and then each nth unit (like every 100th) after that is selected. Testing every 50th widget that comes off the assembly line, for example. CONVENIENCE: Using data that is simply easy to obtain. Like surveying family members or classmates. STRATIFIED: Population is subdivided, based on some characteristic (like income level) into at least two subgroups (strata). Samples are drawn from each subgroup (strata).","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
