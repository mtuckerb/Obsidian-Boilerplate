This case came before the Court on June 6, 2025 for a hearing. Plaintiff Victoria Bradford appeared, testified and was represented by Robert Levine, Esq. Defendant Matthew Tucker Bradford appeared, testified and was represented by Heather Whiting, Esq. The Court hereby ORDERS as follows: FINDINGS The Court finds that there has been a substantial change in circumstances relevant to spousal support since the issuance of the Divorce Judgment dated March 12, 2024. Specifically, the Defendant's imputed income has been significantly disrupted. At the time of the divorce, the Defendant was unemployed. During the hearing on December 19, 2023, he testified that he anticipated obtaining employment within a few months and expected to earn between $75,000 and $125,000 annually, despite not holding a college degree. He had prior experience working in the software engineering and IT field. However, since the entry of the Divorce Judgment, the Defendant has been unable to secure employment in that field. He testified that he has applied to over 200 positions and continues to actively pursue opportunities. He presented a detailed application log to the Court (See Exhibit 1). The Defendant explained that most job applications and communications occur online, and he experienced difficulty receiving responses from potential employers. CONFIRM In an effort to improve his outcomes, he subscribed to a resume and job application support service called TealHQ, which helped him assess and enhance his resume to better meet digital screening requirements. On March 7, 2024, the Defendant attended a workshop titled How to Land a Job in 8 Weeks, which focused on networking strategies. Defendant testified that he exhausted his professional contacts, having reached out to friends and colleagues since his job loss in Fall 2023. The Defendant’s job search efforts resulted in several opportunities: On April 22, 2024, he interviewed with Evidation, proceeded to a second interview on April 29, and reached the final interview stage on May 10. He was ultimately not selected for the position. On June 3, 2024, he interviewed with Redflag AI, completing three interview rounds but was not offered the role. On July 3, 2024, he interviewed with Code.org and proceeded through three rounds of interviews. He received a rejection on August 7, 2024, which he described as devastating. On August 23 and 30, 2024, he interviewed with Tangelo. Although he felt encouraged after speaking with the CEO, he was ultimately passed over following a brief interview with the human resources manager. Facing increasing financial strain, the Defendant applied for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and engaged with Fedcap Rehabilitation Services for career support. He underwent a career assessment and, based on the results, agreed to pursue a career in Social Work. He began receiving TANF benefits on September 6, 2024, and signed a service agreement with Fedcap on September 9, 2024. He subsequently applied to the University of Southern Maine’s (USM) School of Social Work and was accepted on October 24, 2024. During this time, he continued his search for Software and IT-related employment. On January 15, 2025, the Defendant interviewed with MAS Medical for a position as an after-school Behavioral Health Professional (BHP). He began classes at USM on January 21 and started work with MAS Medical on January 28. On February 5, he interviewed for a second BHP position with CATT Associates and commenced employment on March 3, 2025. On May 5th 2025, Defendant was hurt while caring for a client. He has a broken foot and recently applied for worker’s compensation. INSERT/ CONFIRM Despite pursuing a new career in social work and maintaining part-time employment, the Defendant continues to seek opportunities in the Software and IT field.\t CONCLUSIONS OF LAW [I WILL INSERT THE LAW AND POTENTIAL CASELAW REGARDING NO CHILD SUPPORT WHEN ON TANF] Title 19-A M.R.S. § 951(A) (5) contains the factors that the court shall consider when it determines an award for spousal support. On a motion to modify spousal support, the Court considers the relevant factors set forth in the statute.(insert case/ law) The court discusses each relevant factor in turn. The length of the marriage. The parties were married 24 years. The ability of each party to pay. Plaintiff is unable to pay support. Defendant is unable to pay support. The age of the party. Plaintiff is 48. Defendant is 49. The employment history and employment potential of each party. The Court has carefully considered the Defendant’s employment potential. At the time of the Divorce Judgment on March 12, 2024, the Defendant was unemployed but had a background in the software engineering and IT field. He testified that he expected to secure employment within a few months. Since that time, the Defendant has made diligent efforts to secure employment in his field. He applied to over 200 positions and went through multiple interviews with several companies. Despite these efforts, he has been unable to obtain employment in the IT sector. These facts demonstrate that while the Defendant has a work history in a relatively high-earning field, his current employment potential in that field has diminished through no lack of effort on his part. The Court finds that the Defendant's employment potential, as it existed at the time of the Divorce Judgment, has not materialized. The evidence supports that the Defendant has acted in good faith to pursue a degree in social work with the goal of becoming self-supporting in this new field. \tRegarding the Plaintiff, since the divorce she earned a bachelor’s degree in teaching from USM. She is currently employed by Westbrook School Department as a substitute teacher. Her employment potential as a full-time teacher is high. The education and training of each party. At the time of the Divorce Judgment, the Defendant did not possess a college degree but had prior work experience and training in the software engineering and IT field. Defendant was unable to re-enter the IT workforce, likely due to a lack of degree, competition with younger candidates, and layoffs in the fields. After receiving a career assessment Defendant committed to a new career path in social work, a profession more aligned with his skills, interests, and longer-term employment viability. He intends to earn a bachelor’s degree in social work from USM by June 2027. Defendant is taking reasonable steps to obtain the education and training necessary to improve his employment prospects. As noted above, Plaintiff now has a bachelor’s degree in teaching and can obtain full-time employment as a teacher. The provisions for retirement and health insurance of each party. Plaintiff has retirement with MainePERS. She was awarded Defendant’s 401k and Charles Schwab IRA in the divorce. Defendant has nominal funds in a Charles Schwab IRA ($1.33) and recently started a Vestwell state IRA ($40). Defendant is on MaineCare. AS A SUB, I DON’T SEE THAT VICTORIA HAS HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH HER EMPLOYER ON HER PAYSTUB. The tax consequences of the division of marital property, including the tax consequence of selling the marital home, if applicable. N/A The health and disabilities of each party. N/A (it might be worth noting that I am diagnosed with ADHD, which certainly hasn’t helped my career) The tax consequences of a spousal support award. N/A The contributions of either party as a homemaker. N/A The contributions of either party to the education or earning potential of the other party. N/A Economic misconduct by either party resulting in the diminution of marital property or income. N/A The standard of living of the parties during the marriage. N/ (note to self add M-1) The ability of the party seeking support to become self-supporting during a reasonable period of time. The Court finds that Plaintiff should be able to become self-supporting at this time. With her bachelor’s degree, she can seek employment as a full-time teacher. The effect of the following on a party’s need for spousal support or a party’s ability to pay spousal support. Actual or potential income from marital or nonmarital property awarded or set apart to each party as part of the court’s distributive order. N/A Child support for the support of a minor child or children of the marriage. N/A Any other factors the court considers appropriate. Defendant has been on TANF support since September 2024. Maine law implies that a payor spouse should not be required to pay support to a payee spouse while qualifying for state benefits. WE WILL SEE WHAT KRISTIN FINDS ON THIS DURING LEGAL RESEARCH . The Clerk of Court is specifically directed to enter the Judgment on the Civil Docket by notation incorporating it by reference pursuant to M.R.Civ.P. 79(a).
