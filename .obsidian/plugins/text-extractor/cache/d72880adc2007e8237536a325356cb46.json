E-mail: senjootiroy@gmail.com Decision Editor: Tonya J. Roberts, PhD, RN Abstract Background and Objectives: Compassion is described as an affective experience arising from witnessing the undeserved suffering of another that propels one to provide protection and cooperation. Climate change is often associated with “underserved suffering,” especially of younger and future generations. Consequently, contemporary climate discourse has expressed hostility toward older generations for inflicting such suffering. Studies on intergenerational relations within the context of climate change agree that intergenerational solidarity, rather than conflict, is necessary for effective climate action. Because compassion is instrumental to solidarity, in this study, we explore intergenerational climate- related expressions of compassion leading to intergenerational solidarity. Research Design and Methods: We interviewed 16 climate activists from 8 countries (aged 16–76 years) to understand how they view climate responsibility. Thematic analysis was undertaken to create and explore themes related to intergenerational compassion and solidarity. Results: Compassion flowed in both directions: from younger to older generations in the form of forgiveness, empathy, and understanding, and from older to younger generations through advocacy, lifestyle changes, and transmission of knowledge and skills. All participants emphasized solutions over accusations. Areas of focus varied between industrialized and developing countries. Cultural factors played an essential role in intergenerational perceptions. Discussion and Implications: Climate change can be a polarizing issue with older adults fielding accusations and younger people facing criticism for demanding climate action. Examples of intergenerational compassion can counter ageism, reshape climate narratives, encourage intergenerational cooperation, harness the skills of different generations, and create a sustainable world for all ages. Keywords: Climate activism, Climate advocacy, Generations The climate crisis has formed the core of intergenerational dialogue and debate in recent times. Different stakeholders have advocated for diverse interests. At the global—most visible level—(youth) activists have continued to demand climate action (United Nations, 2023); climate sceptics and deniers have attempted to refute scientific evidence (Lejano et al., 2020); and governments, corporations, and world lead- ers, many of whom are older adults, have been criticized for their lack of urgency in addressing climate change, leading to the perception that climate action so far has been grossly in- adequate (United Nations, 2022). Unfavorable, even hostile, climate discourse, in relation to both older and younger age groups have added to the general discontent, furthering the perception that different generations are placed on opposite sides of the climate debate (Bergmann & Ossewaarde, 2020; Park et al., 2021; Roy & Ayalon, 2023). At slightly smaller scales and not-so-visible levels, however, instances of older adults (such as Knitting Nannas Against Gas and Greed or the global Raging Grannies International) and diverse age groups collaborating to fight climate change abound (Ayalon et al., 2022; Roy & Ayalon, 2023). An important component of such collaboration and teamwork is the feeling of compas- sion for those affected/expected to be affected the most by the climate crisis. This study, therefore, aims to explore the role of compassion among activists in relation to climate action and intergenerational relations. Compassion There exists little consensus on the definition of compassion (Goetz et al., 2010). Over time and across disciplines, com- passion has been understood in a variety of manner: from a combined state of love and sadness to a vicarious expe- rience of another’s distress to a subvariant of love. Some scholars have defined compassion as a feeling or emotion, others consider it to be an attitude, a response, a condi- tion, or an other-oriented state. Some researchers have con- flated compassion with empathy, pity, sympathy, kindness, altruism, and empathetic distress; others define compassion as a unique feeling that encompasses aspects of empathy, tenderness, love, and sympathy, yet remains distinct. Goetz et al. (2010), following a thorough review of compassion and its origins, define compassion as a feeling or affective experience arising from witnessing the undeserved suffering of another that motivates one to provide protection and cooperation.

(2016) offer a five-element defi- nition. They posit compassion as a cognitive, affective, and behavioral process comprising (1) recognizing suffering, (2) understanding the universality of human suffering, (3) feeling (empathy) for the person suffering, (4) tolerating uncomfort- able feelings that arise in response to the situation/person suf- fering (anger, fear, distress), and (5) motivation to act/acting to alleviate suffering. This definition applies to both self- and other-directed compassion (Strauss et al., 2016). Compassion can help shape moral judgments and actions of individuals. Moreover, compassion may be both a universal emotion with associated behaviors like forgiveness, benevolence, helping, and reciprocity being highly valued in all cultures, as well as vary across cultures based on expressions of compassion (Goetz et al., 2010). Compassion may be felt for people we know as well as for those whom we will probably never meet (e.g., people experiencing a natural disaster or dying in war or facing starvation in a different part of the world; Strauss et al., 2016). Overall, it may be surmised that compassion involves the arousal of an emotion in response to someone’s suffering, especially undeserved suffering, that motivates one to act in accordance with one’s capacity to alleviate distress. Moreover, in addition to reaching “outward” to help the person(s) suf- fering, the process of compassion also involves traveling “inward” to accommodate one’s own range of emotions as one prepares to offer help and assistance. Importantly, com- passion may extend toward people regardless of social ties. Intergenerational Relations Intergenerational relations may be broadly defined as rela- tionships of solidarity, conflict, or ambivalence (Lüscher & Pillemer, 1998). Relationships of solidarity are based on social exchanges or transfers between generations. Such rela- tionships primarily exist within family structures whereby members of two or more generations, particularly adult chil- dren and older parents, offer care, assistance, and support to one another. Intergenerational solidarity may manifest as multidimensional, multifaceted relationships with six distinct dimensions: (1) structural (geographical distance; availability, working arrangements, and demographic characteristics); (2) associative (amount and type of contact); (3) affective (emo- tional closeness); (4) consensual (shared values and beliefs); (5) normative (mutual commitment to filial obligations); and (6) functional (emotional, financial, instrumental support exchange; Bengston & Roberts, 1991). Although relation- ships of solidarity are primarily studied within the family context, they may also extend to communities or issues that affect larger numbers of people (Ayalon et al., 2022; Roy & Ayalon, 2023). Intergenerational conflict refers to the collective strain, antagonism, and tension between older and younger genera- tions, including those not yet born, over the distribution and allocation of resources, and is commonly invoked in debates surrounding intergenerational equity, justice, and reciproc- ity (Silverstein, 2007). Intergenerational conflicts may focus on one’s identity and sense of belonging with a particular group, incompatibility of values, or differences in behaviors (Urick, 2022). They may be observed within families (Guo et al., 2022), at workplaces (Urick et al., 2017), or regarding sociopolitical issues such as health care and welfare spending (Binstock, 2010). In recent times, such conflicts have arisen in response to the UK European Union membership referen- dum (Brexit) and the global climate movement as decisions of older generations will affect young people’s futures for a very long time. At a smaller scale, intergenerational conflict may manifest as ageist stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination toward both younger and older generations (Ayalon & Tesch- Römer, 2018; de la Fuente-Núñez et al., 2021). Both intergenerational solidarity and conflict represent two extremes of intergenerational relations, a “love–hate” duality that presupposes either pure cooperation or extreme tension between generations (Lüscher & Pillemer, 1998). However, solidarity and conflict are not mutually exclusive. Rather, all dimensions of intergenerational solidarity harbor the potential for conflict and burden. Similarly, conflict within relationships does not preclude the possibility of intergen- erational solidarity. Finally, conflict can be either construc- tive or destructive; constructive conflict can build and shape healthier relationships and lead to greater solidarity (Szydlik, 2008). Most intergenerational relationships, therefore, may be understood as exemplifying the tenets of “intergenera- tional ambivalence” or the co-occurrence of conflict and soli- darity within the same relationship or circumstances (Lüscher & Pillemer, 1998). Climate Change and Intergenerational Relations That children, younger people, and those yet unborn will have to bear a much greater burden of climate change than current older generations in an undeniable fact. In all like- lihood, the lives and major life decisions of younger gen- erations will be shaped first and foremost by their climate realities even though they have contributed the least to the climate crisis. Recent statistics state that children under the age of 5 are likely to be affected by 90% of all diseases that result from the climate crisis. Further, tens of millions of chil- dren are expected to be undernourished, experience extreme water shortage, severe and prolonged droughts, and weather events; be forced to migrate and experience interruptions to their education (Save the Children, 2023). Climate change may also lead to depression and poor mental health among youth and adolescents (Majeed & Lee, 2017). Impacts of cli- mate change may accumulate over the life course to endanger the health and well-being of individuals in their later years (Wang et al., 2021) in addition to causing excess mortal- ity and reducing life expectancy at birth in some countries by the end of the century (Hauer & Santos-Lozada, 2021). Children and young people living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are doubly vulnerable. Climate change is also expected to adversely affect social determinants of health including livelihoods, socioeconomic equality, and access to health care and social support (World Health Organization, 2021). While the plight of younger generations has been made visible by the climate movement, the impact on older gen- erations also merits attention. It is important to acknowl- edge that the same factors that affect younger generations also affect older generations, although the latter will experi- ence the consequences for a shorter period. Often, however, older generations are more susceptible to extreme weather events, natural disasters, and displacement than others (Cooper, 2022). They also suffer negative health impacts; Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/64/3/gnad063/7188247 by guest on 20 April 2025 The Gerontologist, 2024, Vol. 64, No. 3 3 excess morbidity and mortality; food, energy, and livelihood insecurity; and poorer mental health due to climate change (Ayalon et al., 2021; Jessel et al., 2019; National Institute of Ageing, 2022; The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2023; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2022; Watts et al., 2021). Moreover, older adults in LMICs have contributed very little to the climate crisis but are experiencing disproportionate impacts of the same. In many cases, older adults around the world may have fewer resources and lower capacities than oth- ers to cope with and adapt to environmental degradation. Regardless, older generations are confronted with accusa- tions of having failed younger generations, including their own children and grandchildren, by neglecting to address the climate crisis even though many older adults are at the frontlines of climate action today (HelpAge International, 2021; Roy & Ayalon, 2023). The Present Study In light of this intergenerational tussle between climate responsibility and climate change impact, this study aims to explore the element of compassion in intergenerational climate relations and perceptions. Climate action perforce demands intergenerational solidarity without which ambi- tious climate goals will remain unfulfilled. An important pil- lar of solidarity is compassion, especially for the undeserved suffering of others. Climate change may be perceived as unde- served suffering being inflicted upon younger generations. It may also be perceived as undeserved blame and responsi- bility being placed on older adults, many of whom did not have knowledge about climate change or power and author- ity in historical climate-related policy decisions and are yet involved in climate action. In this study, therefore, we aim to explore how climate activists of different ages and cultures express understanding and compassion toward members of different generations in the face of changing climate realities. We focus on activists because they are a vocal group with the ability to influence large numbers of people. Moreover, in media and climate discourse, well-known activists have been both portrayed in ageist light as well as have perpetrated age- ist sentiments (Roy & Ayalon, 2023). Therefore, in this study, we focus on activists who work at community levels in order explore how they perceive intergenerational relations. Research Design and Methods Data Collection This study is part of a larger study on intergenerational rela- tions and perceptions in the context of climate change. For this study, we conducted semistructured online interviews between January 2021 and July 2022. Respondents were recruited through the circulation of flyers via social media outlets as well as through references (snowball sampling). Potential respondents were encouraged to contact the researchers via e-mail to express interest in participation. Subsequently, the researchers shared a Qualtrics survey link to an online con- sent statement and demographic information form. Upon receiving consent and demographic details, the researchers e-mailed the participants to finalize the date and time of interview. Interviews were conducted via Zoom and Google Meet and lasted between 33 and 73  min (mean = 54  min). All interviews were conducted in English and recorded with participant consent. The study was approved by the research ethics committee of the Principal Investigator’s institution. In total, we interviewed 16 self-identifying, English- speaking climate activists from eight countries. We specif- ically targeted a wide age range and geographic spread to address our research question. The age range for this study was 16–76 years; 10 (62.5%) respondents were female; 6 (37.5%) were male. One (6.25%) respondent was enrolled in high school, 10 (62.5%) respondents had or were pursu- ing undergraduate degrees, 2 (12.5%) respondents had post- graduate degrees, and 3 (18.75%) individuals had doctorate degrees. Eight (50%) respondents were involved with local and community-level organizations, 3 (18.75%) respondents were part of national organizations, and 5 (31.25%) respon- dents were involved in international climate efforts. Seven (43.75%) respondents resided in lower–middle income coun- tries (India, Nigeria, and Tanzania) and 9 (56.25%) respon- dents lived in high-income countries (Canada, Ireland, Israel, UAE, and United States). Participant profile is available in Table 1. The recruitment flyer, online consent statement, and interview guide are included as Supplementary Materials 1–3. Data Analysis Data were analyzed using Braun and Clark’s (2006) six- phase thematic analysis guidelines. Upon conclusion of the interviews, the audio files were transcribed by professional transcribers and verified against the audio recordings by the researchers. One file could not be transcribed due to poor audio quality. The next step involved in-depth reading of the transcripts and note-making to form a general idea of core messages residing in the data. This step, crucial in the data anal- ysis process, allowed the researchers to familiarize themselves thoroughly with the data as well as note down initial ideas, thoughts, patterns, and questions for further examination and analysis. At the next step, all transcripts were uploaded to the software Dedoose for data management and organization. The transcripts were coded with a mix of descriptive (“lack of awareness about climate change”; “sustainable lifestyles”; “collective effort required”) and interpretative (“guilt-driven activism”; “evidence of intersectoral collaboration”; “making a mockery of activism”) codes to capture both diversity and similarity in data. A detailed codebook was prepared, modi- fied, and refined throughout the coding process. Subsequently, the data relevant to each code were collated. In the next step, the researchers searched for themes—important, patterned responses in relation to the research question—in the data. During the process some codes were clustered to generate a theme, some were collapsed, and other themes stood alone. For example, the codes, “young people respond to trends,” “older people respond to religious exhortations,” “businesses care about public image,” “older people listen to fellow older adults,” and “people care about ensuring income and liveli- hood” were clustered to form the theme “trusted messengers” to highlight the variety of approaches adopted by the partic- ipants to motivate and engage people of different ages and backgrounds in climate action. Potential themes were subse- quently reviewed, defined, and named. At the final step, the themes were grouped by age of activists (below age 60 and 60+) for generational as well as country and cultural compar- isons. Age 60 was used as the lower range for older adults in keeping with the United Nations’ definition of older persons.

Throughout the process, potentially illustrative quotes were extracted from the data. These have been used to substantiate the themes of this study. Results The results are broadly divided into two themes: (1) other- and self-directed compassion expressed by older activists, and (2) other- and self-directed compassion expressed by younger activists. Both themes have two subthemes. Theme 1: Other- and Self-Directed Compassion Expressed by Older Activists This theme comprises two subthemes, “empathy, solidarity, and respect” and “blame and ageism.” Older activists comprised five individuals over the age of 60 (age range: 61–76 years). All older activists were female and resided in high-income countries. Some had a history of being involved in activism for various causes, others were inspired by Greta Thunberg’s activism. All older activists were well read and informed about climate change and its local and global impacts. Compassion from older activists was expressed in the form of advocacy and awareness raising activities, transmission of knowledge and skills, and deliber- ate efforts to lead sustainable lifestyles. Some activists were engaged with international organizations like Extinction Rebellion; one had joined a socialist political party with a strong climate agenda; and others had formed or joined com- munity organizations. Empathy, solidarity, and respect One of the primary motivations of older activists to fight cli- mate change was to leave the world a better place for future generations. However, love and concern for the planet and all living beings were equally motivating factors. [The] reason I got involved is because I’m a grandmother now and I don’t want to leave a mess. Well, I know I will be leaving a mess, but hopefully I might help a little. (A.H.) … some of the fieriest people that I’ve met in [volunteer network in the U.S.] are retirees, and they are just mad that their grandchildren face this future that they never had to worry about. And they are just on fire and consumed with advocacy … that’s all they think about. They wake up and they just email all day, or they read climate articles … they’re 65+, and they wake up in a cold sweat at night. (B.C.—not an older activist but works with older activists) Although all older participants were deeply invested in activ- ism and had every desire and intention of making a difference, they sometimes struggled to balance “despair” with “hope.” And while they empathized with younger generations, they also understood that the young were crucial to the climate fight and therefore deserved support at every step. It’s more of an existential crisis for them [the young] … also, hopelessness possibly for some … [But] I guess the younger would have more energy. They’re more informed. They’re more passionate, there’s more at stake for them. And they’re maybe angrier … all that is positive, and also creative. (A.M.) [If] I was being honest, despair, but hoping for miracles. [I have] great faith in the younger people, maybe I’m putting too much burden on their shoulders. But they have a lot more knowledge than I had at that age about what’s going on, and therefore the means to work towards fixing it, but they need as much support as they can get. And they need a more social and just society to support them. (A.H.) Older activists also accorded due respect to the “no- nonsense” approach of the youth. They acknowledged the appeal of young voices calling for climate action and the compassion and resolved that it generated among older generations. I can only think that the voice for the climate probably is the voice of the young. … if you think of Greta’s [Thunberg] voice. It’s very direct … no bullshit, no nonsense, calling people out … I think a lot of older people hear that and respect that voice. It’s very simple … in a good way … and you can hear the anger … I think the younger people’s voice … there’s something about it, maybe people trust it. It’s very sincere … When I hear young people talking about it [climate change], I feel very moved. I don’t feel as moved when older people talk about it. (A.M.) Older activists were driven by a strong sense of compassion for younger generations. They understood the implications of the weight and scale of the unwanted, choiceless burden that younger generations were inheriting. This formed the founda- tion of their activism efforts. Blame and ageism Although all older activists were motivated to work for younger generations, their journey has not been easy. Some have faced accusations for perpetrating the climate crisis, and although they were gracious in accepting the same, they also displayed self-compassion by stating that, unlike current younger generations, they did not have access to crucial climate- related information in the past, and therefore cannot be held entirely responsible for the crisis. Moreover, different gener- ations have contributed to climate change, and it is unfair to blame current older generations. Finally, according to the par- ticipants, many older adults around the world are currently trying to rectify the collective mistakes of the past. … all the data wasn’t there. All the knowledge wasn’t there. And I don’t know what could have been done about that. Maybe we were a bit blind … I don’t mind feeling guilty about it because it galvanizes me to try and do a bit more now in the time I have left. (A.H.) I would think we are to blame … but … there’s a limit to how much free will we have really … so, we have to forgive ourselves to a certain extent … we didn’t have the awareness really to see what was. (P.T.) If you go back to the … use of fossil fuels in machinery … that dates to the 19th century and accelerated especially with … the invention of the of the automobile … that is not something that my generation is responsible for … So, to say, it’s all my fault, or my generation’s fault … to say it’s an intergenerational issue, when it’s much more a system and a class and power issue, is not very helpful. (H.S.) In addition to fielding accusations about the climate crisis, older activists have also faced ageism during their activism efforts. For example, A.H. left a well-known climate advocacy Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/64/3/gnad063/7188247 by guest on 20 April 2025 6 The Gerontologist, 2024, Vol. 64, No. 3 group because she was “confronted with blatant ageism.” According to her, It [ageism] was just smack in my face … a lot of these were young people who had just left their parents’ homes … they found the older people maybe a bit bossy, like their parents … so, there was a resentment on that level … on paper, they encourage intergenerational activities, it’s just what I actually found on the ground, for me was unac- ceptable. Another activist, A.M., felt that being an older person as well as a woman may be a “disadvantage” in some advo- cacy groups where younger activists “talk over” older activ- ists and men dominate conversations. She, however, believed that young people were sometimes unconsciously ageist and, therefore, she did not particularly mind. Most of the older people I know, love when younger peo- ple join the group or get involved … but I don’t know that happens the other way around … if younger people feel resentful that older people have created this mess— and I understand that if they do—at least older people are involved or somehow offering something back to try and help with the mess. Even though the efforts of older activists may not always be respected and appreciated, they are still motivated and driven to do their part. A.H., upon leaving the advocacy group, joined a more suitable organization to continue her activism efforts. A.M. has continued to work with her group. Other older activists have also not let up. Rather, all of them dis- played compassion by accepting younger people’s cause for resentment and, rather than withdraw from advocacy efforts, set aside their own grievances to continue to work for younger generations in different capacities. Theme 2: Other- and Self-Directed Compassion Expressed by Younger Activists This theme comprises two subthemes, “forgiveness, under- standing, and solidarity” and “ageism versus determination.” Forgiveness, understanding, and solidarity The 11 younger activists (aged 16–44 years) displayed compassion in the form of understanding and forgiveness toward older generations. Rather than dwelling on the past to inculpate older people in the climate crisis, they proac- tively adopted a solution-oriented approach. In doing so, they embedded self-compassion in their activism by honoring their fears and concerns for their futures. They, however, did not absolve older generations of all responsibility. Rather, they displayed a clear understanding of inheriting the climate crisis and held older generations responsible for at least some part of past and present (in)action. … younger people have really got a raw deal … [it] makes me angry that more older people aren’t stepping up … some older people [are] struggling with … illness … pover- ty … [But] people who are older and are flying around the world having trips … eating meat every meal … I do feel like it’s very careless … (J.F.) … the youth like us are so vulnerable … sometimes we may see that we want to pursue something in our life … but when it comes to the realities, the environment … does not allow us to do it. So, I think we are the most vulnerable … (M.A.K.) And yet, in an act of solidarity, younger activists chose to look beyond generational failings and accepted responsibility for rectifying past mistakes. A couple of activists even credited the older generations’ actions for the platform of climate activism of the present. Older generations … maybe they weren’t that informed or they were kind of selfish … just wanted to make money … So, I think the older age has played a big role [in climate crisis] but … [instead of] blame, I think our age now, the younger age, we need to correct those mistakes and make sure that to people [who] are going to come after us, we’ll be proud to say, “okay, the older age brought this problem, I’m going to maintain a sustaining solution.” (A.F.N.) I can’t say that they’ve [older generations] been unfair be- cause they could not know the impact … And they have transferred [unsustainable practices] from generation to generation … maybe the reason behind them doing that [exploiting natural resources] is now the reason behind what we are now doing [climate activism] … if there was no problem, we will not do anything. So, there’s no one to blame … (Z.W.J.) The second component of younger activists’ understanding and tolerance of past mistakes stems from the fact that most of them (7) belong to LMICs where rampant development, consumerism, and the proliferation of polluting industries started much later than in Western countries. Therefore, in their eyes, the real “culprits” are the current middle gener- ations who were the first to experience and access modern, affluent, unsustainable lifestyle practices. As for older genera- tions, sustainability was so intricately woven into daily prac- tices that they did not need to think about environmentalism as a separate subject. … I don’t think they [the older generation] understand what’s going on … their lifestyle was so different … there was no plastic, there was hardly anything … so they don’t really have a connection with it [climate change] … [it has little] relevance to their life … they don’t go around or- dering Amazon packages … they use buckets [instead of showers] … they use clay bottles [instead of plastic] … For them, it’s not an everyday thing to … go to the mall and shop … go out for long drives or take the plane and go somewhere. It’s the younger generation which has started doing all of this. So, I think for them … they are pretty much … as sustainable as they can get. (A.S.) In addition to analyzing climate responsibility fairly and allo- cating responsibility where it is due, younger activists were also open to intergenerational learning and transfer of indige- nous skills and knowledge, thereby reiterating climate action as a collective, intergenerational effort. [Older generations] have knowledge … our generation are not listening and not adapting. [People think] “why should we, when we have a lot of technology and we are reaching space, why should we use old technology?” Another ques- tion … of young generations is, “why don’t we search for Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/64/3/gnad063/7188247 by guest on 20 April 2025 The Gerontologist, 2024, Vol. 64, No. 3 7 a better option now?” Searching [for] better option will take so many years. But in the older generation we have a hand in practice … We need to take some technology from the older [generations] and use it in the newer ones, then we can move forward … you can’t ignore their knowl- edge. They have a better knowledge, better understanding. (R.A.M.) Younger generations’ focus on the future, rather than the past, allows them to utilize their time and energy construc- tively. Keeping the past in perspective, however, helps them to make wiser decisions in the present. Importantly, they real- ize that alienating older generations will do more harm than good for climate action. Ageism versus determination Although younger activists displayed maturity and understand- ing regarding the role of older generations in the climate crisis, they also experienced ageism while reaching out to older peo- ple. Younger activists were assumed to be less knowledgeable, less experienced, and therefore, less credible sources of knowl- edge. For older people who had spent their entire lives in close proximity to nature and natural resources, the idea of being “taught” about the environment by younger people was diffi- cult to accept. Moreover, cultural norms dictated that knowl- edge and wisdom are traditionally transmitted from older to younger generations. Consequently, young climate activists experienced difficulties in their work with older generations. For example, L.N. faced multiple hurdles during his outreach efforts within the Maasai community. One of his primary bar- riers was that of cultural practices regarding age hierarchy: “… sometimes they believe that young people cannot teach older people.” Other activists also reported similar issues. … in this part of the world when a younger one is trying to educate people older, the lesson is very hard to take … they assume you’re young, they’re old, and they think be- ing old is based on more experience, they’ve been seeing these [since] before your arrival … (M.S.O.) It’s very hard to convince people, especially in the rural areas because they believe that they have not faced climate change before … that … they’ve lived long and did not face that impact and [so] they cannot believe in climate change issues. (Z.W.J.) To deal with the issue of acceptance—across countries, cul- tures, and age groups—young activists have come up with innovative solutions—that of designating “trusted messen- gers” who will be easily accepted by the target audience. I try to use some old wise men … and we have cultural leaders here … so I try to become friends with them, keep them close to me … we have very smart girls from our community … we use them to reach out to other girls. And sometimes I … reach out to old women … and try to tell them to bring … everybody together. (L.N.) I still feel one of the best ways to get this information and get it [to] stick to all age groups is by passing [it] through the religious heads. So, if the Imam or Umma in the mosque … says that Prophet Muhammed is not going to be happy with the way you treat the environment … in Church the pastor [says] Jesus is not going to be happy … before you know, the information is around. (A.F.N.) In addition to reaching out to various groups through trusted messengers, activists also believed in targeting the youth for education and awareness. Some activists focused on their immediate community of young people, like U.K., an advo- cate for slow and conscious living, who believes that teach- ing his children about sustainability is a way to “empower” them. He also believes that establishing a spiritual practice is integral to climate action as it “makes you more capable to have [bear] inconvenience in your system,” which is import- ant for sustainable practices that often require compromises on comforts and conveniences. Other activists organized protests, marches, and awareness campaigns in schools and youth organizations. For example, A.S. tries to make sustain- able practices “cool” and “trendy” among her schoolmates. She believes peer pressure can work wonders with teenagers if harnessed for the right reasons. Similarly, M.S.O. and his team are “intensifying the effort on educating … children because … the children find a way of passing the educa- tion to their parents.” Some activists believed in focusing on children as young as kindergarteners because although “the burden of change is on everybody … if there is any hope of changing anything … it is by educating the younger gener- ations” (E.G.L.). Targeting younger generations for climate action, therefore, could ultimately be an act of compassion as it would equip and empower them with knowledge and skills to navigate an uncertain future. Discussion and Implications This study was undertaken with the goal to explore inter- generational perceptions of climate change among activists of different ages and backgrounds. Although a wide range of sentiments were expressed by the participants, compassion, especially in the face of present hostility and anticipated hard- ships, stood out among others. Compassion was expressed as both a feeling and an act, especially by older activists who stand to gain little by persisting in the face of resentment from younger generations and following conscious, sustain- able, and restrictive lifestyles. The compassion expressed by older activists reflected the five-element definition proposed by Strauss et al. (2016): older activists recognized the unde- served suffering of younger generations; they acknowledged the global scale and universality of climate change-induced suffering; they felt and expressed empathy for younger gen- erations; they tolerated uncomfortable feelings, such as guilt, shame, and disappointment; and they found motivation to alleviate suffering. Additionally, they directed compassion toward themselves and, in doing so, channeled their efforts toward constructive activities that will benefit even those with whom they have no personal ties. The compassion extended by younger generations, on the other hand, may be consid- ered an act of goodwill and generosity that may ultimately enhance allyship and solidarity in climate action. Importantly, it underlines the need for a diverse yet united approach, espe- cially as some people are expected to shoulder a heavier bur- den than others. Although compassion is an important pillar of intergenera- tional solidarity, the results indicated the prevalence of inter- generational ambivalence regarding climate responsibility and impact (Lüscher & Pillemer, 1998). Even though both the young and the old were working toward the same goal, both experienced ageism in the form of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination from the opposite generation, reflecting Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/64/3/gnad063/7188247 by guest on 20 April 2025 8 The Gerontologist, 2024, Vol. 64, No. 3 the prevalence of criticism and judgment of different genera- tions expressed in public discourse, at the ground level. Older activists in Western countries were accused of perpetrating climate change and acting “bossy” during climate advocacy; younger activists in LMICs faced cultural barriers that con- sidered them uninformed and less experienced than older gen- erations, a common assumption about young climate activists around the world (Roy & Ayalon, 2023). Both older and younger activists, however, acted to transcend barriers of age- ism to prioritize the climate fight over their personal interests. Instead of allowing negative experiences to hinder their activ- ism efforts, both younger and older activists expressed empa- thy and understanding of past mistakes and future impacts, showcasing the co-occurrence of solidarity and conflict in intergenerational relations and perceptions. Differences were observed in the populations targeted for climate advocacy and awareness by older and younger activ- ists, reflecting the needs of their respective societies. Older activists were more invested in the politics of climate change, whereas younger activists focused on awareness and educa- tion. Consequently, older activists contributed most of their time to lobbying, campaigning, canvasing, writing e-mails/ policy feedback/articles on intergenerational justice, and cre- ating awareness about investment of pension funds in “clean” companies. Younger activists, on the other hand, invested significant amounts of time and energy in raising awareness about climate change. Moreover, whereas older activists focused on impact of unsustainable practices and policies where the occurrence of climate change was a foregone con- clusion, most younger activists were tasked with familiarizing people with the concept of climate change first and only then discussing its impacts. This difference in approach indicates varying levels of awareness of the climate crisis, which shaped the roles and responsibilities of climate activists in different societies. This is important considering the fact that all older activists lived in Western countries, whereas most younger activists lived in LMICs. Awareness is a key component of climate action, and lack of awareness can greatly hinder the achievement of climate goals, as realized by all activists in this study. Older activists, whose generation is accused of exacerbating climate change, attributed their lukewarm response to climate change in the previous decades to lack of awareness and information. Similar situations seem to be unfolding in LMICs now although par- ticipants agreed that, in general, people, especially younger generations, are equipped with far greater knowledge and information about climate change than before. Still, creating awareness in LMICs, where large populations are dependent on natural resources for life and livelihood but have the few- est resources to cope with climate change impacts, is integral for climate action and adaptation as awareness is linked to better adaptive capacity (Marshall et al., 2013). This article aimed to explore the understudied construct of compassion in relation to climate action and intergener- ational relations. Compassion has been proposed as an anti- dote to unsustainable behaviors as it can (1) change the way people act, think, and feel about climate issues, (2) enhance one’s “power of caring” and, (3) in concert with contem- plative practices, may make one more mindful of conscious living (Garfin, 2019; Grant, 2021). Research has also shown that empathy for the suffering of the environment can pro- mote pro-environmental moral reasoning, attitudes, and behaviors (Berenguer, 2007, 2010), while compassion for the suffering of people can enhance pro-environmental val- ues, intentions, tendencies, and donations for nature organi- zations (Pfattheicher et al., 2016). This study contributes a new dimension to the relationship between compassion and climate change by focusing on climate activists and intergen- erational perceptions. Climate activists are at the forefront of climate advocacy; they can single-handedly educate and influ- ence large numbers of people and yet, most activists receive little recognition for their efforts. Even less is known about their struggles, motivations, and relationships with the people with whom they work. The findings of this study, therefore, provide insight into how compassion is manifested in climate activism among different generations. This study has several limitations. First, our sample size was small compared to the age range and geographic spread that was targeted. Second, we were able to interview only English-speaking participants. Third, all older activists lived in Western countries, whereas most younger activists lived in LMICs. Finally, we had fewer older activists compared to younger activists; a more balanced representation would have further enriched the data. Notwithstanding these limitations, however, the findings are important, insightful, and add to the literature on compassion, climate activism, and intergen- erational relations. The findings can also help counter ageist perceptions about different generations, encourage intergen- erational cooperation and solidarity, and reshape climate narratives.
