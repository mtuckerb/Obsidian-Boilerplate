{"path":"2025/Spring/PHI-275 - The Nature of Compassion/PHI-275 Final Paper/Paper #2 - Spring 25(1).pdf","text":"Paper #2 – Compassion Theories Applied Over the past few weeks, we have been talking about philosophy and compassion and how it exists in the world on a more practical level. I would like to continue this by taking the theories we have been working with and applying them to a film where compassion is present, lacking or perhaps, both. To accomplish this, I would like to you watch a film and then talk about the theories we have engaged to date in relation to it. In ARES, I have collated some films that I think can easily be used in this assignment. The ones that are in ARES are readily available through the University’s library holdings. Certainly, there are other films that you may think of and want to work with that are available to you through streaming services that you may subscribe to at home. I am fine if you pick a film outside of the ones I have on reserve. Please just run it by me first so that we can make sure it fits the assignment. Please note that one of the films I included is called 5B. It is a documentary about an AIDS hospital unit in San Francisco. It is very well done because it honestly shows what the epidemic was like in those early days. However, it can be difficult to watch. So, if you decide to watch it, please go into it knowing that. Your task here is watch the film of your choice and then think about all the things we have talked about in relation to compassion and apply some of the ideas to your analysis of the film. For the paper: 1.Clearly explain to me and illustrate your understanding of two of the theories of compassion. Please feel free to reuse the theories that you talked about in Paper #1 as well as Bein, etc. There are also some essays in ARES that we did not read that you can read and apply. 2. Apply these concepts to specifics within the film. Critically analyze the theories in relation to what you are seeing in the film. 3. For example, what did compassion do? Did it make things better or worse? What did the lack of compassion do? Make things better or worse? There are other questions as well for you to answer. You do not have to answer these questions directly. They are meant to trigger your thinking. I want to see what and how you are thinking about what you have thought about to date. I am open to whatever you want to talk about, providing that you do the following in the paper: Establish a clear point of view within your paper. Please make it clear what point you are trying to make – a thesis statement. Please develop your reasoning. Please establish within your discussion a clear understanding of the philosophers’ thoughts. Engage the source material in detail. Remember to show your reader how you are thinking vs. telling them. Please be specific. Avoid general concepts. Proofread and edit your writing carefully. Since this is an online class where all thoughts are conveyed through writing, your writing mechanics are extremely important – including using MLA correctly. I am fine if you use external sources, but please remember to cite every idea that does not belong to you. You can talk about the film that you are analyzing. You do not have to cite it. The length requirement for this paper is 5-7 pages. If you need guidance with MLA here is the link, I suggest via OWL Purdue - https:// owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/ mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html. Please note - I am fine if you want to use another formatting style such as APA. But please make sure you use it correctly. OWL Purdue has an APA style guide on its website as well. This paper is the final exam for the class. The paper is due through Brightspace by 5/7 - 11:59 PM. Please note I will not be able to accept late submissions. Please let me know if you have any questions. I am happy to meet and talk over Zoom. Good luck!","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
