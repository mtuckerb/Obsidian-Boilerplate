To what extent can suffering become a meaningful experience? And can suffering ever be justiﬁed – whether now or later – in terms of ‘spiritual development’ or the achievement of some common good? Nietzsche writes famously that, ‘what does not destroy me makes me stronger’, and there is wisdom in Kierkegaard’s claim that suffering is the necessary condition for all spiritual growth – as the title of one of his Upbuilding Discourses proclaims: ‘The Joy of It, That the School of Sufferings Educates for Eternity’. 1 Now some kinds of spiritual suffering can be viewed in this way – the various forms of despair, guilt, bad conscience, anguish and loneliness, which eventually lead to a deeper level of insight and self-understanding. But set against this would be the devastating grief that we associate with the death of loved ones and the trauma of separation or abuse which undermines the meaning of life instead of afﬁrming it. If we consider physical suffering, a similar distinction can be made: some physical pain can be useful in letting us know our body has been damaged; or it can be necessary, like a painkilling injection, just to avoid more suffering in the future. But there comes a point when physical suffering is so extreme or on such a massive scale that any attempt to justify it in terms of God’s plan or the march of progress is morally repugnant, and the worst exercise of (philosophical) bad faith. ‘Theodicy’ is the common term for the vindication of God’s goodness in the face of the existence of evil; and Emmanuel Levinas calls it a ‘scandal’ whenever extreme suffering is justiﬁed in terms of some higher good. As he notes, ‘Pain is henceforth meaningful, subordi- nated in one way or another to the metaphysical ﬁnality envisaged by faith or by a belief in progress. These beliefs are presupposed by theodicy! Such is the grand idea necessary to the inner peace of souls in our distressed world. It is called upon to make sufferings here below comprehensible’. 2 In light of the Holocaust and other atrocities of the 20th century, Levinas claims that any kind of theodicy – whether this would be a natural or supernatural justiﬁcation of suffering – is evil in itself: for quite apart from the evil of causing the suffering of others, the willingness to justify the suffering of other people is what allows an outrage such as the Holocaust to happen in the ﬁrst place. In this respect, Levinas goes so far as to claim that, ‘the justiﬁcation of the neighbour’s pain is certainly the source of all immorality’. 3 This essay looks at the problem of suffering in the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. From his early writings, especially Time and the Other (1947) and Totality and Inﬁnity (1961), Levinas attempts to grasp the signiﬁcance of suffering in the context of individual experience. For Levinas, suffering is viewed as radical passivity and a pure undergoing which shatters my capacity for assimilating the world. In suffering, he writes, ‘there is an absence of all refuge. It is the fact of being directly exposed to being. It is made up of the impossibility of ﬂeeing or retreating. The whole acuity of suffering lies in this impossibility of retreat. It is the fact of being backed up against life and being. In this sense suffering is the impossibility of nothingness’.4 In ‘Transcendence and Evil’(1978), Levinas returns to the problem of suffering to deal with it from the perspective of an individual, the Biblical hero Job, who undergoes immense physical, HeyJ LIII (2012), pp. 111–123 © 2011 The Author.

Later, in ‘Useless Suffering’(1982), Levinas deals with the collective suffering of millions during the course of the twentieth century including two world wars, the gulags, Nazi concentration camps, Hiroshima and Cambodia. Levinas focuses on the Holocaust as ‘the paradigm of gratuitous human suffering’, and he notes that, ‘the disproportion between suffering and every theodicy was shown at Auschwitz with a glaring, obvious clarity’.5 Richard Cohen describes the problem in traditional theological language: ‘Since God wills all things, God willed the Holocaust. Because all things willed by God are good, the Holocaust too was good. Not just that good comes from the Holocaust, but that the Holocaust itself was good, as repentance, sacriﬁce, puriﬁcation, sign, redemption, punishment, perhaps all of these, but ultimately good in itself’.6 The present essay is not about ‘the problem of theodicy’, but it is an attempt to say something more about the philosophical signiﬁcance of suffering. There are three questions that will guide this inquiry: First, the question concerning the nature of suffering: What is suffering and how is it to be described? Here, Levinas’s perspicuous descriptions help to uncover some of the essential aspects of suffering, although he breaks with traditional phenomenology by emphasizing that suffering is not to be grasped as an act of subjectivity; as he comments, ‘Taken as an “experienced” content, the denial and refusal of meaning which is imposed as a sensible quality is the way in which the unbearable is precisely not borne by consciousness, the way this not-being-borne is, paradoxically, itself a sensation or a given’.7 Levinas’s account of suffering takes us beyond intentionality insofar as it reveals our relationship to something that does not come from ourselves; he argues that suffering is in itself ‘excessive’ and the concrete manifestation of what is ‘non-integratable’. The second question concerns the meaning of suffering: Can such (extreme) suffering ever be viewed as meaningful in terms of the big picture that it belongs to? Is it a ‘useful’ suffering, or do we have to say that it is ‘useless’? And leaving aside the suffering of others, what about the signiﬁcance of my own pain? – On this point, Levinas holds that while the other’s suffering cannot be rendered meaningful, my own suffering as suffering for the suffering of the other is meaningful in itself. The third question concerns the response to suffering: What should the proper reaction to suffering be? Some thinkers, including Job’s friends, respond to suffering with theodicy, for they refuse to accept that anything could happen without good reason. Some thinkers, such as the Stoics, avoid suffering by insisting that nothing can hurt us unless we allow it to, which assumes the (unlikely) possibility of complete self-mastery. Others, including those in the Buddhist tradition, argue that compassion is the supreme virtue and it must be cultivated as the basic response to all beings that are capable of suffering. According to Levinas himself, the suffering of others initiates subjectivity in the call to responsibility (and compassion) which is given in the face of the Other. This may (or may not) be an empirical event, but it reveals something like a transcendental framework for ethical responsibility and caring: The epiphany of the Absolutely Other is a face by which the Other challenges and commands me through his nakedness, through his destitution. He challenges me from his humility and his height . . . The absolutely Other is the human Other (autrui). And the putting into question of the same by the Other is a summons to respond. . . . Hence, to be I signiﬁes not being able to escape responsibility. 8 The proper response to the Other is to remove misery and to give aid; but the ‘face’ is inﬁnite, there is always more to do, and in this respect I am (always) afﬂicted and ashamed. Levinas’s account of responsibility and compassion as ‘suffering for the suffering of the other’ is very 112 RICHARD WHITE different from that of other perspectives including Buddhism, and the ethics of sympathy in Scheler or Hume. It describes the suffering that I undergo in being commanded by the other and cast into abjection as one who is ‘inﬁnitely’ responsible and guilty. As we will see, however, such a view of the traumatic nature of compassion is problematic and calls into question some important features of Levinasian ethics. It also leads to the possibility of a different model of compassion that more clearly illuminates the reality of our ethical lives. 2). What is suffering? Suffering includes the extremity of physical pain, as well as the emotional anguish and spiritual despair which every individual is bound to experience at some point in her life. It has been suggested that there is a signiﬁcant difference between ‘pain’ and ‘suffering’, since the ﬁrst is primarily ‘physical’ while the latter is basically ‘mental’. As Eliot Deutsch comments: ‘One has a pain or “that is painful”, but “I am suffering”. Where there is no ego there is no suffering – although there might be pain’. 9 Against this, however, the language of physical experience is often used to describe what Deutsch would regard as purely ‘mental’ aspects of suffering: This is why we express emotional suffering in physical terms; when we say that we are tortured by guilt, or burning with shame; or our heart aches because of something that happened. Indeed, it would not be surprising if every form of suffering, including those which are primarily ‘spiritual’ or ‘emotional’ had a physical correlate in the body itself – fear is both physical and mental, for example, and depression always has a somatic aspect. The upshot of all this is that it may be possible to understand the nature of suffering by focussing on physical pain as its most direct and unmediated form. – In suffering, we experience the limits of self-assertion, and the most extreme form of this is physical anguish, in which the self is rendered passive and impotent by the torment that ruins it as a subject. Herbert Fingarette puts this point succinctly when he notes that: ‘To suffer is to be compelled to endure, undergo, and experience the humbled will, rather than to be able to impose one’s will’.10 This means that the experience of suffering is the opposite of self-assertion and is shot through with the will’s experience of impotence and limitation. Something like this is also the starting-point for Levinas’s own account of what it is to suffer. In the course of several books and numerous articles, Emmanuel Levinas sketches the outlines of a phenomenology of suffering. Suffering is not always a central concern of his philosophy, but it is possible to reconstruct his basic view of suffering by examining comments drawn from several different texts. In Time and the Other, for example, Levinas announces that he will focus his remarks on ‘the pain lightly called physical’, for ‘in it engagement in existence is without any equivocation’.11 Once again, the point here is that physical suffering is the purest form of suffering since it completely overwhelms the sovereignty of the self and as such it is an experience without mediation. As Steven Tudor notes in his account of compassion and remorse: ‘Many physical pains intrude so forcefully into one’s consciousness that they impose their own signiﬁcance which no stoic attitude can alter – that signiﬁcance possibly being a pure sense of raging chaos that obliterates all other matters of signiﬁcance, so rupturing, so con- suming is the pain’. 12 Levinas also notes that in spiritual suffering it is still possible to preserve an attitude of dignity and distance from whatever affects one, and in this respect one remains independent and ‘free’. Indeed, it can be argued that spiritual suffering is itself a kind of luxury that can only exist for as long as we are not disturbed by physical pain. As Levinas comments, from one perspective (which he refers to as ‘socialism’), ‘solitude and its anxieties are an ostrichlike position in a world that solicits solidarity and lucidity; they are epiphenomena – phenomena of luxury or waste – of a period of social transformation, the senseless dream of an eccentric individual, a luxation in the collective body’. 13 By contrast, physical suffering in its most extreme form effaces subjectivity and all subjec- tive attitudes. For Levinas, physical suffering involves the ‘irremissibility’ of being and the LEVINAS, THE PHILOSOPHY OF SUFFERING, AND THE ETHICS OF COMPASSION 113 absence of all refuge; in such pain we are backed up against being with no possibility of escape, and for this reason it provides the clearest, most unambiguous model for suffering in general. As Levinas notes, signiﬁcant suffering corrodes all the structures of meaning that we project into the world; it overwhelms all ‘virility’ – or the effort to be masters of our own fate – until ﬁnally one is reduced to a state resembling helpless infancy: ‘Where suffering attains its purity, where there is no longer anything between us and it, the supreme responsibility of this extreme assumption turns into supreme irresponsibility, into infancy. Sobbing is this, and precisely through this it announces death. To die is to return to this state of irresponsibility, to be the infantile shaking of sobbing’. 14 In her own account of torture in The Body in Pain, Elaine Scarry conﬁrms this point, when she argues that more than resisting language, suffering and pain actively destroy language and all other meaningful projects, so that the subject reverts to ‘a state anterior to language, to the sounds and cries a human being makes before language is learned’.15 In this way, suffering is world-destroying. Indeed, to suffer greatly is to have one’s world reduced to the content of one’s pain. In the passage cited above, Levinas notes a connection between suffering and death. Accord- ing to Levinas, the one announces the other: There is not only the feeling and the knowledge that suffering can end in death. Pain of itself includes it like a paroxysm, as if there were something about to be produced even more rending than suffering, as if despite the entire absence of a dimension of withdrawal that constitutes suffering, it still had some free space for an event, as if it must still get uneasy about something, as if we were on the verge of an event beyond what is revealed to the end in suffering. 16 Extreme suffering involves complete passivity. In suffering we are subject to something which does not come from ourselves and which tends to undermine all meaningful structures of subjectivity. In this respect, suffering is the anticipation of death as the encounter with some- thing that cannot be avoided or held at arm’s length. Both suffering and death involve the end of mastery, and with each, the contents of consciousness are destroyed. In his collection of essays, At the Mind’s Limits, Jean Amery, who was tortured by the Nazis, also seeks to articulate the strong sense of a connection between acute physical suffering and death. Speculating on the meaning of his own experience, he comments that: Pain . . . is the most extreme intensiﬁcation imaginable of our bodily being. But maybe it is even more, that is: death. No road that can be travelled by logic leads us to death, but perhaps the thought is permissible that through pain a path of feeling and premonition can be paved to it for us. In the end, we would be faced with the equation: Body = Pain = Death, and in our case this could be reduced to the hypothesis that torture, through which we are turned into body by the other, blots out the contradiction of death and allows us to experience it personally. 17 In extreme physical suffering, such as the torment that Amery describes, the individual becomes purely a body, ‘and nothing else besides that’. For as long as it continues there is no space for reﬂection; and this violent reduction to physical being is the most intense form of negation which seems to parallel the negation of death. Elaine Scarry agrees: death and suffering are ‘the purest expressions of the anti-human, of annihilation, of total aversiveness, though one is an absence and the other a felt presence, one occurring in the cessation of sentience, the other expressing itself in grotesque overload’. 18 Levinas elaborates his position on suffering in the essay, ‘Transcendence and Evil’, which is actually a critical review of Philippe Nemo’s book, Job and the Excess of Evil. 19 Job, we remember, suffers emotional pain with the death of all his sons and daughters; he suffers the 114 RICHARD WHITE physical pain of boils from his scalp to the soles of his feet; and he suffers the moral anguish of being abandoned by God in spite of his attempt to live a good life. Job suffers all of these pains at the hands of Satan who has persuaded God to let him test the extent of Job’s devotion. He laments not only his own woes, but also the suffering of other human beings, especially those who are innocent and poor: ‘The poor, like herds of cattle/ wander across the plains,/ searching all day for food,/ picking up scraps for their children./ Naked, without a refuge,/ they shiver in the bitter cold . . . /In the city the dying groan/ and the wounded cry out for help;/ but God sees nothing wrong’. 20 In ‘Transcendence and Evil’, Levinas focuses on three different aspects of the suffering or evil that Job experiences. His comments are in part a creative appropriation of Nemo’s critical perspective, but they also develop some of the themes that were more tentatively proposed in Time and the Other. First, Levinas argues that the basic quality of evil is excess. It is excessive in the sense that it cannot be appropriated or grasped by the subject who seeks to organize her world; but even more than this, it is ‘a modality, a manner: not ﬁnding a place, the refusal of all accommodation with . . . , a counter-nature, a monstrosity, what is disturbing and foreign of itself’.21 As Levinas comments, evil is not an excess because suffering can be terrible, and go beyond the endurable. The break with the normal and the normative, with order, with synthesis, with the world, already constitutes its qualitative essence. Suffering qua suffering is but a concrete and quasi-sensible manifestation of the non-integratable, the non-justiﬁable. The quality of evil is this very non-integratability, if we can use such a term; this concrete quality is deﬁned by this abstract notion. 22 Later in the essay, ‘Useless Suffering’, Levinas afﬁrms the point that ‘all evil refers to suffer- ing’, and that the evil of pain is itself, ‘the explosion and most profound articulation of absurdity’. 23 In this respect, his comments on evil as pure excess must also refer to the nature of suffering – including the torments that Job endures – as something that cannot be appropri- ated into any horizon of meaning. Why? Because suffering is that which is excessive in itself; it is always ‘too much’. As Cohen puts it: ‘Little and great suffering are both suffering’ 24 ; and so, the ‘too much’ of pain is actually a part of its essence. More than this, suffering is not just inappropriable, it actively undermines and overwhelms the subject’s own projection of meaning. It brings about the undoing of the self as the one who would be the sovereign subject of consciousness. Levinas brings out Nemo’s point that in the case of Job especially, evil comes with a sense of persecution and individual torment. Suffering is never grasped as something that just happens to me, but it is something that is done to me. Why me? we ask; What have I done to deserve this?; and, Why must I suffer in this way? In Levinas’s words, ‘evil reaches me as though it sought me out; evil strikes me as though there were an aim behind the ill lot that pursues me, as though someone were set against me, as though there were malice, as though there were some one. Evil, of itself would be an “aiming at me” ’.25 As we have seen, the temptation is to appropriate everything in terms of the meaningful projects of the self. Hence suffering can be reconstrued in terms of theodicy or some other meaningful goal: if I am suffering then perhaps I am being tested by God; or as his friends insist, Job must have done something to deserve it. In either case, I establish a relationship with the good that is beyond evil. Hence, it can be claimed that from this religious perspective, ‘Meaning then begins in the relationship of the soul with God, and begins with its awakening by evil. God does evil to me to tear me out of the world, as unique and ex-ceptional – as a soul’. 26 Going beyond the book of Job and its explicitly religious context, we could also say that suffering individualizes us, LEVINAS, THE PHILOSOPHY OF SUFFERING, AND THE ETHICS OF COMPASSION 115 by taking us away from the enjoyment of the world that would be our normal state of being, and towards ourselves as ethical human beings concerned with our responsibilities for each other. In this way, the discovery of evil – or the experience of suffering – involves radical alterity and the realization of the ethical as the ground of our being. Levinas’s point is that suffering isolates the individual, while it projects the possibility of something beyond suffer- ing and evil that would be the locus of the good. He warns us, however: ‘Is this horror of evil in which, paradoxically, it is given, the Good? There can here be no question of a passage from Evil to the Good through the attraction of contraries; that would make but one more theodicy’. 27 In apparent conﬁrmation of this, we can point out that the problem of suffering seems to inaugurate much of philosophy and religion, and clearly inspires the development of Stoicism and Epicureanism, Christianity, Buddhism and Judaism to name but some among many. Not, ‘How did the world get here?’, but ‘Why is there suffering?’ is the ﬁrst provocation to thought. But once again, the danger lies in disregarding suffering through the temptation of theodicy. This glimpse of the ethical becomes completely explicit in the ﬁnal part of Levinas’s own phenomenology of evil – or ‘evil as the hatred of evil’, which leads to the awareness of the good. Calling Nemo’s reading of Job into question, Levinas comments: ‘One is surprised that there never appears on the foreground the problem of the relationship between the suffering of the self and the suffering which a self can experience over the suffering of the other man. Even to suppose that in this Biblical text itself there never is any question of that, would there not be in this very silence some secret indication?’ 28 Of course, the book of Job is primarily concerned with Job and his attempt to make sense of his suffering, but Levinas appropriates Nemo’s discussion and the story of Job to illuminate his own philosophical view. In this essay, Levinas suggests (before making it completely explicit in the essay on ‘Useless Suffering’), that there is an asymmetry between the suffering of someone else – which is useless, and without meaning from my point of view – and my own suffering when it involves suffering for the one who suffers. As we will see, Levinas claims that when I experience compassion and assume responsibility for the other person’s suffering, my own suffering becomes meaningful insofar as it reveals the ethical dimension of human experience. So far, then, we have isolated at least four different aspects of Levinas’s own philosophy of suffering which are clearly mapped out in his writings: First, suffering involves the impossi- bility of escape. In suffering I am backed up against the world, and I can do nothing. In this way, suffering is said to expose the irremissibility of being. Second, suffering is the end of all mastery and ‘virility’, and in this sense, suffering involves the intimation of death. Third, suffering is excessive, the non-synthesizable and the non-integratable; the overwhelming of the subject and the failure of appropriation. – All of these aspects point toward the way in which suffering involves radical passivity – not patience which requires subjective endurance in the face of evil – but the overwhelming of the subject and its layers of signiﬁcation. For Levinas, suffering is not the denial of freedom, or the frustration of any desires that I may have. It is the denial of subjectivity itself in pure absurdity. And hence, it must be said: Suffering is a pure undergoing. It is not a matter of a passivity which would degrade man by striking a blow against his freedom. Pain would limit such freedom to the point of compro- mising self-consciousness, permitting man the identity of the thing only in the passivity of the submission. The evil which rends the humanity of the suffering person, overwhelms his humanity otherwise than non-freedom overwhelms it: violently and cruelly, more irremissibly than the negation which dominates or paralyzes the act in non-freedom . . . The evil of pain, the harm itself, is the explosion and most profound articulation of absurdity. 29 116 RICHARD WHITE Finally, the fourth point that Levinas makes is that suffering is experienced as something that is done to me – whether in the course of nature or at the hands of other people, I experience myself as a victim, and not as the agent of my own existence. In this respect, suffering becomes the origin of meaning and justiﬁcation, for it evokes the response of ‘theodicy’ and its equivalents – ‘there must be a good reason why it happened’, or ‘it was meant to be’ etc. In this way, suffering inspires the reassertion of meaning in the face of its destruction. Levinas’s phenomenology of suffering is compelling and to a great extent his account is conﬁrmed by Scarry and Amery who write from very different standpoints. However, we may note one point of concern: Levinas does not dwell on the distinction between suffering that is voluntary and suffering that is not chosen. The ﬁghter who is hurt in the ring may actually suffer more than the innocent person who is beaten, but his suffering is not experienced as a violation because it is chosen as a means to the end of success. This suggests that suffering is not always measured by the sheer amount of physical pain. Likewise, it is more traumatic to be hurt deliberately by others, even though one may suffer exactly the same amount of pain during the course of a physical illness. Of course, Levinas argues that in a sense all pain is experienced as ‘personally directed’, but the fact that someone else has deliberately inﬂicted this pain on me gives it an even more repellent aspect. As Amery comments: ‘Whoever has succumbed to torture can no longer feel at home in the world. The shame of destruction cannot be erased . . . That one’s fellow man was experienced as the antiman remains in the tortured person as accumulated horror. It blocks the view into a world in which the principle of hope rules’.30 We would ask Levinas to what extent one can ever speak about suffering in general; perhaps it is possible, but the origin of any given suffering is an essential aspect of it. 3). The second question is: Can suffering ever be meaningful? As we have already noted, some philosophers, including Nietzsche, exalt the value of suffering because it promotes ‘character’. In Beyond Good and Evil, for example, Nietzsche claims that, ‘profound suffering makes noble’;31 in The Gay Science, he says that, ‘only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit’;32 and in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, he describes the sickness of the modern world in trying to eliminate all pain: ‘We have invented happiness’, say the last men, ‘and they blink’. 33 Of course, it may well be the case that some kind of a struggle is necessary for living a ﬂourishing life; and the possibility of a successful struggle also comes with the possibility of failure and the suffering that failure entails. Levinas, however, is more concerned with the most extreme forms of suffering that completely destroy the well-being of people without any possibility of redemption in the future. For example, the suffering of those who are mentally handicapped, who cannot understand their suffering or communicate it to others: ‘One can go further – and doubtless thus arrive at the essential facts of pure pain – by evoking the “pain illnesses” of beings who are psychically deprived, backward, handicapped, in their relational life and in their relationships to the Other, relationships where suffering, without losing anything of its savage malignancy, no longer covers up the totality of the mental and comes across novel lights within new horizons’.34 How could such pure, unmediated pain ﬁnally be recuperated into the context of a meaningful life? Or following Ivan’s ruminations in The Brothers Karamazov, how can we reconcile the suffering and the murder of children with the goodness of creation? How could such things ever be ‘for the best?’ In his essay, ‘Useless Suffering’, Levinas focuses on the mountain of suffering that belongs to the 20th century. Such excessive suffering – the torture and destruction of millions of innocent people, the elderly, children, even babies, calls into question the traditional conception of God as supremely powerful and supremely good, and appears to undermine ‘theodicy’ as a lie. And today, when some people even deny that the Holocaust ever happened, it would seem that the suffering of those who endured the Holocaust has become more pointless than ever. LEVINAS, THE PHILOSOPHY OF SUFFERING, AND THE ETHICS OF COMPASSION 117 Levinas explains: ‘This would be pain in its undiluted malignity, suffering for nothing. It renders impossible and odious every proposal and every thought which would explain it by the sins of those who have suffered or are dead’.35 This leads him to argue that theodicy as the justiﬁcation of the other person’s pain, is ‘certainly the source of all immorality’.36 – In the case of the Holocaust, it was the bystanders, and not just the perpetrators, who allowed this great evil to happen, using rationalization and justiﬁcation which implied that the victims deserved their fate. In this regard, theodicy is not a good thing, but actually an evil and a temptation insofar as it turns us away from the reality of someone else’s suffering by framing it within the context of a larger metaphysical order. But Levinas does not claim that all suffering is meaningless. As we have already noted, he claims that even though the suffering of the other cannot be made meaningful from my perspective, my own suffering can have meaning if I suffer for the other and thereby respond to her suffering: ‘In this perspective a radical difference develops between suffering in the other, which for me is unpardonable and solicits me and calls me, and suffering in me,myown adventure of suffering, whose constitutional or congenital uselessness can take on a meaning, the only meaning to which suffering is susceptible, in becoming a suffering for the suffering – be it inexorable – of someone else’.37 This is the perspective that Levinas intimated earlier in his essay, ‘Transcendence and Evil’, the inter-human region of being that exists insofar as I am bound to acknowledge the suffering of the Other and his claims upon me. According to Levinas: ‘It is this attention to the Other which, across the cruelties of our century – despite these cruelties, because of these cruelties – can be afﬁrmed as the very bond of human subjectivity, even to the point of being raised to a supreme ethical principle – the only one which it is not possible to contest – a principle which can go so far as to command the hopes and practical discipline of vast human groups’. 38 This is the breakthrough of the Good, which inaugurates subjectivity; for I am summoned to responsibility by the face of the Other which commands my obedience now. At one point in his essay, ‘Useless Suffering’, Levinas elaborates his position on the possibility of useful suffering, in terms of compassion, which other thinkers, including Scho- penhauer, Rousseau, Nussbaum and a long line of Buddhist writers, have also viewed as the key to morality. According to Martha Nussbaum, for example, compassion is fundamental and it must be cultivated because it is the basic social emotion. 39 Levinas himself puts it this way: ‘Must not humanity now, in a faith more difﬁcult than ever, in a faith without theodicy, continue Sacred History; a history which now demands even more of the resources of the self in each one, and appeals to its suffering inspired by the suffering of the other person, to its compassion which is a non-useless suffering (or love), which is no longer suffering “for nothing”, and which straightaway has a meaning?’ 40 – In this passage, Levinas is claiming that my own suffering only becomes meaningful when it is suffering which is for the other person. But how would this be possible? One response is to say that by cultivating an awareness of the suffering of others, and by using my moral imagination to identify with their plight, I can develop my natural compassion, and in this way I could become more responsive to the needs of other people. Also, by facing up to my own suffering – and not just ignoring it – I can learn to be more aware of the sufferings of others, and in this way I will be more available to help them. Something like this would be the Buddhist position on suffering which we will brieﬂy consider in the ﬁnal section of this paper. But is this what Levinas has in mind in the passage just quoted? It is tempting to identify Levinas with an appeal to universal love, or agape, and some of Levinas’s commentators have argued that Levinasian ethics is founded upon the value of compassion. In ‘Levinas on Suffering and Compassion’, for example, William Edelglass argues 118 RICHARD WHITE that for Levinas, compassion is the ‘supreme ethical principle’ and ‘the nexus of human subjectivity’. 41 In compassion, we respond to the other by bearing witness to her suffering, and according to Edelglass, such witnessing – as opposed to the gift of food or clothing – ‘is the generosity of ethics.’ 42 Likewise, in his article, ‘What Good is the Holocaust? On Suffering and Evil,’ Richard Cohen argues for the centrality of compassion in Levinas’s ethics. He writes that for Levinas, ‘the only ethical meaning of suffering . . . is compassion. The other person suffers . . . But I am a being who suffers too. What Levinas proposed, then, without any “mystical” implications, is a kind of holy almost sublime contagion of suffering.’43 – But the proper response to this kind of interpretation is just to point out that for Levinas we are obligated to the other regardless of how we feel about it. For while I may feel compassion, I may just as easily feel resentment because I am responsible to the Other even though I never asked to be! Indeed, I am a ‘victim’ and a ‘hostage’, but not because of anything that I have done or could have anticipated: ‘Obsessed with responsibilities, which do not result from decisions taken by a “freely contemplating” subject, consequently accused of what it never willed or decreed, accused of what it did not do, subjectivity is thrown back on itself – in itself – by a persecuting accusation’.44 – The moral anguish that Levinas describes in this passage (and in many others) derives from the ‘inﬁnite’ burden of responsibility that I am made aware of in the face of the Other. And the recognition of this responsibility in no way depends upon the achievement of ‘melting compassion’ or ‘love’. In fact, the term ‘compassion’ does not occur that frequently in Levinas’s writings. And suffering for the suffering of the other – which Levinas considers the only meaningful suffering – is the pain that Levinas associates with the recognition of ethical responsibility. As Terry Eagleton explains in his recent book, Trouble with Strangers: ‘Levinas severs the sentimental bond between agape and affection – which for him is also to cut the link between affection and the affective. We feel the Other affectively, on our pulses or in the crawling of our skin; but this must be distinguished from some common-or-garden affectionateness . . . Ethics is what hurts’.45 For Levinas, the commandment of the Other is profoundly traumatic. It brings me to birth as a subject, by summoning me to shoulder the burden of an inﬁnite responsibility in anguish, turmoil and guilt. For Levinas, ethics is not about ﬂourishing and it is more about being chosen than choosing. It is traumatic to be called to such inﬁnite responsibility. But for Levinas, this is the only meaningful suffering. In sketching the ethical relationship, Levinas describes a powerful drama of anguish and subjection. But what is most important is not the sympathetic contagion of the Other’s dis- tress; it is the claim that the Other makes upon me, regardless of who she is, and regardless of how I feel about it. In Levinas’s account, the Other is remote and unattainable; he (or she) is frequently described as the absolutely Other, and by deﬁnition no relationship is possible with such an Other, who can not be grasped as another myself. I need not recognize the possibility of my own suffering when I look at him. We have nothing in common (from the ethical point of view); I cannot expect reciprocity from him, and what links us is, precisely, difference. In this respect, we must conclude that for Levinas true compassion or empathy is impossible and also irrelevant since my responsibility cannot wait for me to grasp the suffer- ing of the other person. Levinas fails to recognize that what is properly meaningful is not so much the suffering itself but our response to that suffering. For example, if my suffering leads me to commit suicide, then in what sense can it be considered meaningful? And if my awareness of the suffering of another becomes so overwhelming it paralyzes action, does it really have an issue or a point? Suffering is neither ‘meaningful’ nor ‘meaningless’ in itself. What determines the signiﬁcance of suffering is the response of the one who suffers. This may be the original victim – someone like Elie LEVINAS, THE PHILOSOPHY OF SUFFERING, AND THE ETHICS OF COMPASSION 119 Wiesel who lost his family in the Holocaust, but who sought to live a life devoted to justice; or it could be the spectator who suffers in sorrow when she contemplates these events and who may feel compelled to respond. In this respect, my suffering, the suffering of the other, and my suffering for the suffering of the other all remain quite ‘open’ in terms of their ultimate meaning. 4). Finally, then, the third question asks what should the proper response to suffering be? Of course, I should turn aside from my own self-involvement in order to help, and the refusal to help is wrong. But this does not say enough, and we must now consider another perspective. According to ordinary moral understanding, there is a difference between the one who delib- erately inﬂicts suffering on another and the one who doesn’t prevent that suffering from happening; they are both at fault, but there is a moral distinction between the perpetrator and the bystander. There are also others who are not involved in any way, and therefore innocent, at least in this case. According to Levinas, however, I am always already responsible for the suffering of the Other; and he frequently emphasizes this point: I am in reality responsible for the other even when he or she commits crimes, even when others commit crimes. This is for me the essence of the Jewish conscience. But I also think that it is the essence of the human conscience. All men are responsible for one another, and ‘I more than anyone else’. One of the most important things for me is that asymmetry and that formula: All men are responsible for each other and I more than anyone else. It is Dostoyevsky’s formula which, as you see, I quote again. 46 For Levinas there is apparently no distinction between the three ethical levels – of perpetrator, bystander and innocent – at the original moment of ethical encounter. Regardless of whether I caused the suffering of another or had nothing at all to do with it, I am still ‘inﬁnitely’ responsible for the other person. But this is problematic, and it ignores the obvious distinction between compassion and remorse. As Steven Tudor puts it: In the case of compassion, the self stands as witness to the Other’s suffering, while in the case of remorse, the self stands as responsible for the Other’s suffering, that is, as having wronged the Other. In both compassion and remorse, however, the self is in some way “claimed in response to” the Other: the compassionate witness to suffering is “called upon” to respond to what she sees, while the remorseful person is obligated to answer for what he did.47 For Levinas, the only proper response to suffering is remorse or guilt, even to the point of self-abnegation and self-loathing. Of course, it may be argued that Levinas’s discussion of responsibility is at a higher ‘transcendental’ level and has no bearing on the variety of ethical responses that exist in the everyday world. But to have any relevance at all, there must be a relationship of analogy between the two levels so that our everyday responses will be shaped by the description of their ultimate ground. Eagleton complains: ‘The very act that constitutes me as a subject also places me at a distance from my own being. Before the Other I am always in the wrong, always a guilty innocent’. 48 Thus, even though he refers to compassion, Levinas’s ethics is essentially deontological or Kantian, insofar as it is based on responsibility and duty, rather than empathy with the feelings of those whom we take to be sentient like ourselves. For Levinas, ethics is severe and the traumatic relation to the other seems to rely entirely on duty rather than love. And even though Levinas discusses my suffering for the suffering of the other as the origin of the ethical, he does not have compassion in mind as this is typically understood. There are other accounts of compassion in which I overcome the sense of an absolute separation between myself and others by going out of myself towards the Other, putting aside my own concerns, and bearing witness to her suffering as something that brings me sorrow. 120 RICHARD WHITE Such compassion implies the desire to help the other person which may or may not be acted on; but the very recognition of someone else’s suffering is itself a beneﬁcial act. As Elaine Scarry comments, even in extreme physical suffering, An act of human contact and concern, whether occurring here or in private contexts of sympathy, provides the hurt person with worldly self-extension . . . By holding that world in place, or by giving the pain a place in the world, sympathy lessens the power of sickness and pain, counteracts the force with which a person in great pain or sickness can be swallowed alive by the body. 49 In this way, sympathy or compassion works to overcome the isolation that suffering imposes. In Buddhist practice, compassion requires feeling for the suffering of others. It is respon- siveness to misery which includes not only the particular sorrows that others experience, but also the underlying reality of suffering which is grasped as the permanent condition of human existence. Compassion allows us to experience our afﬁnity and our connection with all crea- tures; and the more committed and involved with others we become, the less preoccupied we are with our own selﬁsh desires. As we cultivate our sense of compassion, the concerns and anxieties that characterize our everyday existence fall away, and we become more open to other people and the rhythm of life itself. Such compassion involves an overall attentiveness and availability to the other person. According to Buddhist teaching, it should be unconditional, undifferentiated and universal in scope; and it would certainly include compassion toward oneself. For Buddhists, compassion is one of the most important virtues that should be enhanced because it afﬁrms the underlying reality of our connection with all sentient beings; while at the same time, hatred and cruelty must be diminished, since they are the opposite of compassion. According to the Dalai Lama: When we enhance our sensitivity toward others’ suffering through deliberately opening ourselves up to it, it is believed that we can gradually extend our compassion to the point where the individual feels so moved by even the subtlest suffering of others that they come to have an overwhelming sense of responsibility towards those others. This causes the one who is compassionate to dedicate themselves entirely to helping others overcome both their suffering and the causes of their suffering. 50 In the Mahayana tradition of Buddhism, such a focus on compassion inspires the ideal of the Bodhisattva, or the saint who refuses Nirvana until all other creatures have been released from their suffering. Thus, instead of emphasizing the opposition and distinction between self and other – in terms of radical alterity which is ﬁnally irreducible to conceptual thought – this account of compas- sion calls upon us to see the other person as someone who is basically like ourselves, who has the same capacity for suffering and joy. There is no absolute difference between myself and the other person, for there is nothing that separates me from the afﬂiction of the other that cannot be destroyed by a change of circumstances. Through compassion I afﬁrm my sense of belonging to the human community insofar as I show my care for another person; while at the same time, the one who is afﬂicted and isolated by suffering is brought back into the community by the respect and acknowledgement she is shown. There is an obvious reason why this version of compassion, though brieﬂy sketched, is preferable to the Levinasian view: It explains our connection to the other as one whom we care for – for even though she is an ‘other’, she is also someone with whom we share a common humanity and sentience. But without the recognition of any kind of connection between us – if the other is absolutely other and if it is in some sense inappropriate to put myself in her LEVINAS, THE PHILOSOPHY OF SUFFERING, AND THE ETHICS OF COMPASSION 121 place – then it is unclear how I could ever be concerned about her wellbeing or feel responsi- bility for her. I do not feel the same obligation to rocks as I do to humans, but this is because I have a sense of a ‘shared humanity’ which leads me to care for others in the ﬁrst place. 5). In the past, philosophers have sometimes ignored suffering by denying its signiﬁcance or its wrongness. One way of doing this is through theodicy which seeks to justify suffering as the will of God (or from the secular perspective, as part of the march of history.) This takes attention away from the reality of suffering by framing it within an optimistic narrative, making suffering something that actually belongs to the good. Likewise, stoicism diminishes the problem of suffering by making it subject to the projected mastery of the self. This implies that suffering is not a reality since it is rather a perspective on reality that can change if we change our attitude towards it. In his brilliant phenomenological descriptions, Levinas shows how suffering tends to undermine all signiﬁcance and meaning. Levinas recovers the problem of suffering and his opposition to theodicy in all its forms is well considered. The problem with Levinas’s account emerges once we step back from his speciﬁc discussion of what suffering is, to consider the place of suffering in his overall account of ethical philosophy. As we have seen, it is not the meaning of suffering that is really at issue – depending on the context suffering can be meaningful or quite pointless; but the response to suffering is what matters. At the end of this paper, we focussed on the response of compassion; but compassion as it is typically understood is not a central part of Levinas’s ethical framework. Levinas himself comments, ‘for me the suffering of compassion, suffering because the other suffers, is only one aspect of a relationship that is much more complex and much more complete at the same time: that of responsibility for the other’. 51 Against Levinasian compassion, which involves suffering and self-laceration, we considered another version of compassion which loosely follows the Buddhist model. The latter involves feeling for the other in her distress, and presupposes the recognition of our common humanity. We must learn to cultivate this attitude, for we can be moved by the other person because she suffers like we do, and because we all share a common fate.
