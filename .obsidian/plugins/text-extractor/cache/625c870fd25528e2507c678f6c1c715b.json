If your contact information changes, update your information in your Account Settings. Then, select “Make Corrections” to update the information on your FAFSA form. 2 Make sure your schools have everything they need The financial aid staff at your school may contact you to resolve any issues related to information reported on your FAFSA form. You can also reach out directly to your school and find out if any additional documentation is required. 3 Look out for aid-related communications from your schools Once the schools you applied to have processed your FAFSA form, they will send you financial aid offers. These aid offers tell you what aid you can receive at a particular college or career school. Keep in mind that you don't have to accept all the student aid that is offered, and that your schools may offer amounts that differ from your federal student aid estimates.  For Your Awareness • VA Education and Training Benefits help veterans, service members, and their family members with needs like paying college tuition or finding the right school. • The limit to the total amount of Federal Pell Grants that a student may receive is the equivalent of six school years. Once you've reached that limit, you can no longer receive a Federal Pell Grant. • Based on the information we have on record for you, your Student Aid Index (SAI) is -1500. You may be eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant and other federal student aid. Your college's or career school's financial aid office will use your SAI to determine your eligibility for other types of grants, scholarships, work-study funds, and loans. • This FAFSA Submission Summary reflects your financial aid administrator's use of professional judgment. • Based on information you provided on your FAFSA form, you may be eligible for other federal benefits not awarded by the U.S. Department of Education. Visit StudentAid.gov/help/means-tested-benefits for more information on federal benefits. • The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS ) database was unable to provide your financial aid history. ®  Understand Your Tax Beneﬁts Did you know that the IRS provides tax benefits for education?
