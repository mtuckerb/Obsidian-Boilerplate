Your assignment is to find (web search is acceptable) and submit another such example and briefly explain why you think it's misleading. Example 1: Graphs That Deceive Nonzero Axis: Graphs can be misleading because one or both of the axes begin at some value other than zero, so the differences are exaggerated. Example 2: Page of 1 2 Confirmation Bias A survey question that asks for confirmation. Your survey might say, “Wouldn’t you agree that data visualization tools lead to higher productivity?” By asking, “wouldn’t you agree,” you’re restricting the respondent to answer yes or no, and you’re leading them to say yes. Essentially, you are including the answer in the question. Leading questions might confirm what you hope to see, but they don’t result in accurate data. Example 3: Misleading Spin on Results In 2007, the toothpaste company Colgate ran an ad stating that 80% of dentists recommend their product. Based on the promotion, many shoppers assumed Colgate was the best choice for their dental health. But this wasn’t necessarily true. In reality, this is a famous example of misleading statistics. The ad suggested that dentists preferred Colgate over other toothpaste brands. But the survey asked the dentist to list several brands of toothpaste they would recommend. The data only showed that Colgate was one of a number of different brands that dentists liked. Not quite the same claim, was it? Page of 2 2","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
