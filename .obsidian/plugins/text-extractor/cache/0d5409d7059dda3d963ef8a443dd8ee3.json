C, (2019) Chapter 31.pdf","text":"CHAPTER THREE Impacts of the #MeToo Movement This section examines the impact of the #MeToo movement on speciﬁcareas of American life and culture, from the changes it has wrought in entertainment, business, and politics to debates about the sincerity and value of apologies offered by men accused of sexual misconduct. #MeToo in Entertainment and the Arts The #MeToo movement got its start in the entertainment industry in October 2017 with the allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood ﬁlm mogul Harvey Weinstein. Before long, hundreds of women, and a few men, came forward to accuse well-known actors, directors, producers, agents, and studio executives of sexual harassment or assault. The #MeToo movement revealed a toxic culture permeating the industry, in which powerful men took advantage of their inﬂuential positions to prey on young women hoping to make it in show business. Many of these men saw their reputations sullied or careers ended, while a few—such as comedian and television icon Bill Cosby—were convicted of crimes and imprisoned. The #MeToo disclosures led to several high-proﬁle initiatives aimed at eradicating sexual harassment from ﬁlm, television, and other industries. In January 2018, more than 300 powerful women of Hollywood launched an initiative called Time’sUptopromote changesinlaws, policies,and workplace cultures and provide legal and ﬁnancial resources to help victims hold perpetrators accountable. Time’s Up activists demonstrated their solid- arity by wearing black to the 2018 Golden Globe Awards. Hollywood ﬁlm studios, production companies, and talent agencies responded by adopting codes of conduct for employees, providing mandatory anti-harassment COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 70 The #MeToo Movement training, and creating more effective reporting mechanisms, such as desig- nating individuals on movie sets to hear complaints. Wonder Woman 1984 (to be released in 2019) became one of the ﬁrst ﬁlms to put these measures into place after producer Brett Ratner was accused of sexual misconduct on the set of the ﬁrst installment in the franchise. Many companies in the ﬁlm industry also revamped their employment contracts to include morals clauses, giving them the right to ﬁre anyone accused of inappropriate behavior. After actor Kevin Spacey was accused of sexual assault, director Ridley Scott recast him in the role of J. Paul Getty in All the Money in the World (2017). If Spacey’s contract featured a morals clause, the studio could have sued him to recover the $10 million cost of reshooting all of his scenes with Christopher Plummer replacing him in the role. Some studios also moved toward eliminating the use of nondisclo- sure agreements, which had been used by the Weinstein Company and other businesses to prevent victims of sexual abuse from speaking publicly about their experiences. Time’s Up supporters argued that the lack of women executives, direc- tors, writers, and crew members created power imbalances that facilitated sexual harassment in Hollywood. According to a survey of the 100 highest-grossing ﬁlms of 2017 conducted by the Center for the Study of Women inTelevisionandFilm at SanDiego StateUniversity, women accounted for only 8 percent of directors, 10 percent of writers, and 24 per- cent of producers (Morris 2018). In her acceptance speech at the 90th Academy Awards in March 2018, Best Actress winner Frances McDormand challenged Hollywood to address the inequity by adopting inclusion riders—contractual arrangements speci- fying that a certain percentage of people hired to work on a project must be women and minorities. Several prominent ﬁgures in the entertainment industry immediately announced that their production companies would use inclusion riders for future projects, including Michael B. Jordan of Out- lier Society, Ben Afﬂeck and Matt Damon of Pearl Street Films, and Paul Feig of Feigco Entertainment. Partly due to pressure from #MeToo and Time’s Up activists, demand for female writers and directors showed signs of increasing in 2018. A record number of women received deals for fall 2018 broadcast TV pilots, and women directed 37 percent of the ﬁlms shown at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival that year (Morris 2018). Although many companies in the entertainment industry took steps to distance themselves from men accused of sexual misconduct, the #MeToo movement did not appear to have as much impact on the viewing choices of ﬁlm and television audiences. In a survey of 2,200 adults conducted in May 2018, 47 percent indicated that they would be less likely to watch a COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC movie or TV show starring an actor facing #MeToo allegations, while 34 per- cent said it would have no effect on their viewership. When asked about 20 speciﬁc actors accused of sexual misconduct, however, respondents only identiﬁed two—KevinSpaceyandLouis C.K.—whose work they would be less likely to watch. The survey results suggested that the large number of #MeToo allegations made it difﬁcult for viewers to remember the details of individual cases, plus the public showed a strong tendency to forgive misbehavior by their favorite stars (Piacenza 2018). #MeToo in the Music Industry The world of popular music has long been characterized by a culture of excess—a fast-living, hard-partying atmosphere of “sex, drugs, and rock and roll.” Sexual misconduct ﬂourished in this environment, as successful artists, agents, and executives frequently abused their positions of power and inﬂuence. Stories abounded of rock stars committing statutory rape of underage female “groupies,” or music executives demanding sexual favors of aspiring female recording artists, yet fans and industry insiders dismissed such behavior as an expected part of the music business. Many women felt reluctant to speak out, meanwhile, due to fear of retaliation in the highly competitive industry. As the #MeToo movement got underway, only a few high-proﬁle men in the music industry faced allegations of sexual misconduct, such as Russell Simmons, founder of the Def Jam hip-hop label; Antonio “L.A.” Reid, head of Epic Records; and recording artist R. Kelly. “The ﬁlm industry appears to have numerous monsters within, but in the music industry, the problem may be more systemic,” said Alan Williams, an academic who studies the music business. “It can be harder to identify speciﬁc villains when the very act of aspiring to a musical career requires numerous small acts of compro- mise and acquiescence” (McDermott 2018). In addition, men accused of sexual misconduct seemed to face fewer career repercussions in the music industry. Reid, for instance, bounced back with a new record label a few months after sexual harassment allegations forced him to step down from his post at Epic Records. The #MeToo reckoning began to reach the music industry in August 2017, when pop star Taylor Swift testiﬁed in court against a radio host she accused of groping her. Her deﬁant testimony set an example for other women to follow, as she refused “to retreat from a conﬁdent and com- bative stance as a victim of an alleged sexual assault, in an environment and a culture that typically shames, discredits, and marginalizes women—even celebrities—who take that stance” (Fallon 2017). Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 71 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 72 The #MeToo Movement In January 2018, a study by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California revealed signiﬁcant gender inequity in the music business. Of the top 100 songs released each year from 2012 to 2017, it found that female artists accounted for only 22 percent, female songwriters received credit on only 12 percent, and female producers con- tributed to only 2 percent. In addition, women in the music industry gar- nered only 9 percent of all Grammy Award nominations during that time period (Roberts and Brown 2018). In response, a group of prominent female music executives founded Voi- ces In Entertainment to call for an end to gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the industry. Inspired by the black dresses worn by Time’s Up activists at the Golden Globes, supporters wore white roses to express solidarity during the 2018 Grammy Awards. Singer Janelle Monáe dis- cussed the movement’s goals in a powerful speech during the ceremony. Afterward, singer Kesha performed her nominated song “Praying,” about her efforts to overcome alleged sexual assault by producer Dr. Luke, accom- panied by a group of female stars wearing white. Supporters hoped that the initiative would spark positive changes to the culture of the music industry. #MeToo in the Fashion Industry In the fashion industry, which has long operated on the philosophy that “sex sells,” women often faced a working environment rife with sexual har- assment. Models—many of them teenagers—were objectiﬁed and exploited by agents, designers, stylists, photographers, and others who held the power to make or break their careers. With the rise of the #MeToo move- ment, such big-name models as Kate Upton and Amber Valetta began speaking out about rampant sexual misconduct in the industry. Models told stories of being pressured to appear nude or in sexually suggestive posi- tions, having their images shared without permission, and being touched inappropriately. Model, ﬁlmmaker, and activist Sara Ziff criticized the cul- ture of the fashion industry for normalizing such behavior. “It’s been well known for decades that sexual abuse of models is a pervasive problem,” she said. “The issue is not just the individuals who’ve abused their power, but also the industry’s enabling culture and lack of accountability, and the sense that this kind of predatory behavior just comes with the territory” (Pressler 2018). When the #MeToo reckoning ﬁrst struck the fashion industry, it took the form of dozens of male models coming forward to accuse the famous photog- raphers Mario Testino and Bruce Weber of sexual misconduct. Several female models also resurrected longstanding sexual-abuse allegations against COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC photographer Terry Richardson, who responded by claiming that all of the subjects of his sexually explicit works participated consensually. Hundreds more models shared stories of sexual harassment on social media. Although some advertisers, magazines, and agencies severed their rela- tionships with the alleged abusers, the industry as a whole came under criti- cism for its tepid response. In fact, some prominent insiders responded by defending the industry’s practices and condemning the models who com- plained about mistreatment. Designer Karl Lagerfeld, for instance, derided the sexual assault allegations against Karl Templer, creative director for Interview magazine. “I don’t believe a word of it. A girl complained he tried to pull her pants down and he is instantly excommunicated from a profes- sion that up until then had venerated him,” he stated. “It’s unbelievable. If you don’t want your pants pulled about, don’t become a model! Join a nun- nery, there’ll always be a place for you in the convent” (Gardner 2018). In an effort to improve the experience of models in the industry, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CDFA) instituted new rules requiring designers to provide private changing areas for runway models at 2018 New York fashion week shows. Before this time, models dressed in the same backstage areas where designers and media gathered after the shows. Several designers and activists also used the platform of fashion week to draw attention to problems in the industry. For example, Myriam Chalek organized a Time’s Up Show to showcase models’ experiences of sexual harassment. Each model wore angel’swings andsharedher story on the catwalk while chained to a man in a pig mask. Other designers incor- porated #MeToo and women’s rights themes into their collections, includ- ing Michelle Smith of Milly and Stacey Bendet of Alice + Olivia. #MeToo in Art and Literature Women in the world of art responded immediately to the #MeToo revelations in Hollywood. In October 2017, more than 2,000 artists, cura- tors, educators, and writers spoke out against workplace sexual harassment in an open letter entitled “Not Surprised.” They drew the title from a phrase in artist Jenny Holtzer’s Truisms series, “Abuse of power comes as no sur- prise.”“We have been groped, undermined, harassed, infantilized, scorned, threatened, and intimidated by those in positions of power who control access to resources and opportunities,” they wrote. “We have held our tongues, threatened by power wielded over us and promises of institutional access and career advancement” (Frank 2017a). The letter followed accusa- tions of sexual harassment against Knight Landesman, the former publisher of ArtForum magazine. Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 73 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 74 The #MeToo Movement The #MeToo movement also prompted a reassessment of works of art that objectify or sexualize women, as well as works created by artists accused of mistreating women. Critics contended that museums have a responsibility to challenge the misogynistic views expressed in works such as Paul Gauguin’s Polynesian paintings, which depict nude teenage girls who reportedly served as his sex slaves. Some critics argued that museums should remove questionable works from their collections. Others asserted that museums should continue to display the works but provide context, in the form of wall text or discussion programs, to help patrons understand the power imbalance between artist and subject and its implications for the subject’s agency and consent. Although most museums kept works of historical signiﬁcance, some removed the works of contemporary artists accused of sexual misconduct during the #MeToo reckoning. The National Museum of Art in Washing- ton, D.C., for instance, canceled an exhibition by the portrait artist Chuck Close after eight women claimed that he behaved inappropriately toward them. Other art institutions adapted to the #MeToo era by diversifying their programs and collections to include more women and artists of color. “We need to make space for other voices, whether historical or contemporary,” said a New York art educator. “We need other perspectives besides a white male perspective, besides a misogynist perspective. How many voices do we need that keep reinforcing misogyny?” (Frank 2017b). Fallout from the #MeToo movement also struck the world of literature. In February 2018, fantasy writer Anne Ursu wrote an article for Medium alleging rampant sexual harassment at American publishing industry con- ferences and book festivals. Many of the incidents she described involved prominent male authors and editors who took advantage of their positions of inﬂuence to make unwanted sexual advances toward women hoping to build literary careers. Ursu’s exposé resulted in several prominent authors being dropped by their agents or publishers, including James Dashner (TheMazeRunner), Jay Asher (13 Reasons Why), and Sherman Alexie (The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian). Publishers responded by adopt- ing zero-tolerance policies and inserting morality clauses in author con- tracts. In May 2018, the Swedish Academy announced that it would not award the prestigious Nobel Prize in Literature for the ﬁrst time since World War II due to a sexual harassment scandal involving the French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault. Eighteen women came forward to accuse Arnault of sexual misconduct in incidents that spanned two decades. Some of the women claimed that Arnault assaulted them at Nobel Prize banquets and that the Academy never responded to their complaints. Academy members COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC determined that the allegations compromised the integrity of the award since Arnault’s wife, poet Katarina Frostenson, sat on the committee that decided the winner.

The contest featured the ﬁrst female candidate from a major political party, Democrat Hillary Clinton, which brought issues of gender equality and sexism to the forefront of American politics. Sexual harassment emerged as a topic of national discussion shortly before the November election, when the media released footage from a 2005 television appearance by Donald Trump in which the Republican can- didate seemingly boasted about taking advantage of his celebrity to grope women. When Trump became president despite facing allegations of sexual misconduct, millions of women around the world expressed their determi- nation to stand up for their rights by participating in the January 2017 Women’sMarch. “I think Trump’s victory proved to women—if you did not support him—you could draw two conclusions,” said Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri. “Women were only meant to go so far, and men like that were meant to win in America, or we were playing by an outdated set of rules that women politicians and women in business followed for decades” (Nilsen 2018). Sexual harassment was a pervasive problem in American politics long before the 2016 presidential race, however. Powerful men dominate the political sphere, and many have abused their inﬂuence over female employ- ees to demand sexual favors or make unwanted advances. Since politicians operate in an intense media spotlight, some of the most highly publicized allegations of sexual harassment have centered around political ﬁgures. The 1991 Senate conﬁrmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clar- ence Thomas, for instance, launched a national debate about the treatment of womeninthe workplacewhen former employee Anita Hill claimed in televised testimony that Thomas had sexually harassed her. President Bill Clinton also became embroiled in scandal over allegations of sexual miscon- duct and faced impeachment over his affair with a White House intern. The rise of the #MeToo movement in the fall of 2017 produced a ﬂurry of allegations against prominent ﬁgures in the federal government. Several women came forward in November to accuse Roy Moore, a Republican Senate candidate from Alabama, of making sexual advances toward them when they were teenagers. Although Moore continued to garner support from Trump, the allegations contributed to his defeat in the special election to replace Jeff Sessions, who left his seat in Congress to serve as Trump’s attorney general. A week after the Moore allegations came to light, radio host Leeann Tweeden accused Senator Al Franken, a Democrat from Min- nesota, of groping her during a USO tour in 2006. Franken apologized for COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC behaving inappropriately and resigned from ofﬁce. In December, Democrat John Conyers of Michigan stepped down from his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives after being accused of making unwanted sexual advances toward staff members. Sexual harassment allegations also prompted the res- ignations of Republican representatives Trent Franks of Arizona, Blake Farenthold of Texas, and Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania, as well as federal judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The #MeToo movement also revealed patterns of inappropriate behavior in state legislatures. Two weeks after the Harvey Weinstein scandal rocked Hollywood, the Los Angeles Times published an open letter signed by nearly 150 female legislators, staff members, political consultants, and lobbyists expressing concerns about rampant sexual harassment and gender discrimi- nation in the California state government. Another letter described similar concerns about the atmosphere in Illinois state politics. Oregon state sena- tor Sara Gelser made headlines in November by accusing fellow senator Jeff Kruse of subjecting her to inappropriate touching for years, despite her repeated complaints to the legislature’s human resources and legal depart- ments. Allegations of sexual misconduct eventually encompassed at least 40 lawmakers from 20 states (Ebert 2017). A Partisan Divide in #MeToo Responses In the political realm, the response to sexual misconduct allegations against public ofﬁcials tended to be governed by party allegiance. When Anita Hill testiﬁed before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991, for in- stance, Republican members attacked her credibility, questioned her moti- vations for coming forward, and disputed her account of events in an effort to secure Thomas’sconﬁrmation. Similarly, many feminists stood behind Democrat Bill Clinton—whom they viewed as a valuable ally in the ﬁght for women’s rights—and viliﬁed the women who accused him of sexual misconduct. The pattern continued during the #MeToo era, when most Republican voters either dismissed the allegations against Trump as untrue or decided that his conduct did not disqualify him from serving as president. Although people on both sides of the partisan divide were more likely to overlook #MeToo allegations against members of their own party, polls showed signiﬁcant differences between Democrats and Republi- cans. A survey of 2,350 adults conducted by Time magazine in Novem- ber 2017 found that 74 percent of Democrats agreed that a Democratic congressman accused of sexual harassment should resign from ofﬁce, while only 54 percent of Republicans said that a Republican congressman Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 77 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 78 The #MeToo Movement should resign over such allegations (Alter 2017). In his resignation speech, Franken alluded to what he viewed as inconsistent standards being applied to Trump and Moore. “Thereissomeirony in thefactthat Iamleaving,” he stated, “while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Ofﬁce, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party” (Franken 2017). The Impact of #MeToo on Government The #MeToo movement raised awareness of gender inequity in all levels of government. Women held less than 20 percent of seats in the U.S. Congress as of 2017, for instance, and less than 25 percent of seats in state legislatures nationwide. Some #MeToo supporters argued that increasing the number of women in ofﬁce would help eliminate the power imbalances that facilitated sexual harassment. The sense of empowerment generated by the movement contributed to a record 309 female candidates running for seats in the House of Representatives as of April 2018, along with a record 40 women running for governor in various states. In addition, the pro- choice political action organization Emily’s Listreportedthatitreceived 34,000 inquiries from women interested in running for ofﬁce in 2018, compared to 920 in 2016 (Nilsen 2018). Political leaders responded to #MeToo by putting new rules in place to prevent sexual harassment and hold perpetrators accountable. The U.S. Congress, for instance, required all ofﬁceholders and staff members to attend mandatory anti-harassment training. “Sexual harassment really is abuse of power,” said Merrick Rossein, an attorney who helped the New York Assembly overhaul its sexual harassment policies. “You have powerful people, so you have to know it’s likely to happen. So, knowing it’s likely to happen, what would a prudent, reasonable person or institution do to pre- vent it or to stop it when it occurs?” (Vock 2017). #MeToo encouraged many state legislatures and local governments to review and revise their sexual harassment policies and training programs as well. In Illinois, state legislators established a watchdog position to over- see the handling of harassment complaints and appointed a former federal prosecutor to ﬁll it. Arizona lawmakers proposed legislation banning the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence victims in sexual harassment cases and voiding those already in effect. The Maryland General Assembly reformed its policies to require appointment of an independent investigator to handle sexual harassment complaints and to prohibit lawmakers from using taxpayer funds to pay settlements. COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC #MeToo Prompts a Reassessment of Old Charges Seeing men’s political careers collapse under the fallout of the #MeToo reckoning prompted some observers to reassess the legacies of powerful men who faced sexual misconduct charges in earlier eras, including Thomas and Clinton. #MeToo supporters argued that the revelations forced people to rec- ognize the devastating impact of sexual harassment and the importance of holding men accountable. In this environment, a woman came forward with new allegations about Thomas in 2017, claiming that he groped her at a din- ner party in 1999. Her allegations prompted journalists to investigate the story behind his controversial conﬁrmation hearings, and they found several wit- nesses to corroborate Hill’s testimony that Thomas discussed pornographic ﬁlms at work. Since Thomas denied those charges under oath during his con- ﬁrmation hearings, critics argued that he had committed perjury and called for his impeachment from the Supreme Court. Feminists pointed out that Thomas’sconﬁrmation had far-reaching implications for women’s rights, which he consistently voted to restrict throughout his quarter-century of service on the court. “His worldview, with its consistent objectiﬁcation of women, is the one that’s shaping the contours of what’spossiblefor womeninAmerica today, more than that of just about any man alive, save for his fellow justices,” wrote Jill Abramson (2018). Thomas voted against reproductive rights, insurance coverage for contraception, and equal-pay protections. He also voted with the narrow majority in Vance v. Ball State University (2013) to limit employer liability in workplace sexual harassment cases by narrowing the deﬁnition of “super- visor.” The #MeToo movement also prompted Joe Biden, who served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during Thomas’s conﬁrmation hearings and as vice president under President Barack Obama, to apologize to Hill for not doing more to support her. The #MeToo movement also caused some Democrats to reconsider their earlier support for President Bill Clinton in light of the sexual misconduct complaints made against him by four women in incidents that allegedly occurred between 1978 and 1993. Several liberal journalists wrote articles arguing that Clinton should have resigned from ofﬁce over the allegations, and Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand publicly agreed with their assessment. Other critics claimed that Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which they both described as consensual at the time, constituted sexual misconduct given the enormous power imbalance between the two parties. When asked whether the #MeToo movement forced him to rethink his past behavior, however, Clinton defended his political legacy and pointed Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 79 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 80 The #MeToo Movement to his record of supporting women’s issues throughout his career in public service. Critics argued that Clinton’sjustiﬁcations no longer excused his behavior in the #MeToo era. They also claimed that Democrats’ defense of him during the 1990s delayed the national conversation about sexual har- assment for decades, allowing other powerful men to abuse women with impunity. “The widespread liberal response to the sex-crime accusations against Bill Clinton found their natural consequence 20 years later in the behavior of Harvey Weinstein: Stay loudly and publicly and extravagantly on the side of signal leftist causes and you can do what you want in the pri- vacy of your ofﬁces and hotel rooms,” wrote Caitlin Flanagan. “But the mood of the country has changed. We are in a time when old monuments are coming down and men are losing their careers over things they did to women a long time ago” (Flanagan 2017).

Investigative journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey helped launch COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC the movement in October 2017 by revealing the extensive sexual miscon- duct allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in a New York Times exposé. Other reporters uncovered and publicized sexual harass- ment scandals involving prominent ﬁgures in academia, business, entertain- ment, and politics. The work of these journalists raised public awareness of the #MeToo movement and increased its cultural impact. In addition to these contributions, however, the news media became implicated in the #MeToo reckoning when several prominent journalists joined the ranks of accused perpetrators. Like many other industries, the news media predominantly features men in positions of power. Young, inexperienced reporters often depend on these men for assignments, guidance, and career advancement. Such power imbalances create a workplace environment where sexual harassment is more likely to occur. The Columbia Journalism Review found that 41 percent of staff journalists and 47 percent of freelancers experienced sexual harass- ment in the newsroom. Two-thirds did not report the sexual harassment, however, due to fear of career repercussions (Edge 2018). The problem of sexual harassment in the news media came to light even before the #MeToo movement got underway. In July 2016, Fox News chair- man Roger Ailes resigned after several employees, including news anchors Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly, lodged complaints against him. In April 2017, the New York Times revealed that Fox News had paid millions of dollars in settlements to six women who accused news program host Bill O’Reilly of sexual misconduct. Although O’Reilly disputed the charges, Fox ﬁred him after his program lost more than half of its advertisers. Once the outpouring of #MeToo disclosures began, sexual misconduct allegations surfaced in various media outlets, including radio, television, newspapers, magazines, and online platforms. The accusations targeted executives, editors, reporters, anchors, and hosts. Among the most promi- nent media ﬁgures to face sexual misconduct allegations were news anchor Charlie Rose, New Republic editor Leon Wieseltier, National Public Radio executive Michael Oreskes, CNN analyst Ryan Lizza, and Vox editor Lock- hart Steele. Journalist Moira Donegan drew attention to the pervasiveness of sexual harassment in the industry by circulating a crowdsourced docu- ment known as the “S***ty Media Men” list, which detailed allegations against more than 70 men. Combating Gender Bias in Media Coverage The revelations of widespread sexual misconduct in the media industry raised questions about the extent to which sexist attitudes held by Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 81 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 82 The #MeToo Movement prominent ﬁgures impacted news coverage of the #MeToo movement. Crit- ics pointed out that many of the men accused of mistreating women played a role in shaping public perceptions of sexual harassment. “The media is breaking the news here; the media is also deeply implicated in this news and still shaping how the tale is getting told,” wrote journalist Rebecca Traister. “Ours is an industry, like so many others, dominated by white men at the top; they have made the decisions about what to cover and how, and they still do. The pervasiveness of these power imbalances and the way they affect how even this story itself is being told are instructive” (Traister 2017). Critics pointed out that several high-proﬁle media personalities who pro- vided extensive coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign were later accused of sexual harassment, including Mark Halperin of ABC News, Matt Lauer of NBC News, and Glenn Thrush of Politico. New York Times columnist Jill Fili- povic claimed that these men’s sexist attitudes and actions colored their per- ceptions of the candidates, leading them to portray Trump more positively and Clinton more negatively. “A pervasive theme of all of these men’s coverage of Mrs. Clinton was that she was dishonest and unlikable,” she wrote. “These recent harassment allegations suggest that perhaps the problem wasn’t that Mrs. Clinton was untruthful or inherently hard to connect with, but that these particular men hold deep biases against women who seek power instead of sticking to acquiescent sex-object status” (Filipovic 2017). The sexual harassment scandals facing high-proﬁle individuals damaged the overall credibility of the news media. In an effort to restore the public trust, the industry took a hard-line approach in investigating allegations and holding perpetrators accountable. Many media outlets reexamined their newsroom cultures and took steps to increase the diversity of voices shaping coverage by elevating more women to positions of power. Media leaders also held several industry-wide events aimed at developing systemic changes to end sexual harassment, such as the Power Shift Summit at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. Many industry leaders also took part in the Commission on Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace, an initiative that grew out of the Time’s Up movement and fea- tured Anita Hill as chairperson. Given the power of media to inform audiences and shape their percep- tions of issues, some outlets responded to #MeToo by adjusting their sub- ject matter to better reﬂect the new era. Some men’s magazines, for instance, shifted away from articles focusing on topics that increasingly reﬂected an outdated, stereotypical concept of masculinity—such as fast cars, fast women, and a hard-partying lifestyle. Instead, they began featur- ing articles designed to appeal to men with more evolved, modern COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC sensibilities and interests, such as politics, ﬁlms, music, nutrition, ﬁtness, relationships, and fatherhood.

Sexual harassment occurs frequently in the world of business because the hierarchical reporting relationships found in most companies create power imbalances between managers and employees. Some bosses abuse their power by making unwanted sexual advances, demanding sexual favors, or creating a hostile work environment for their subordinates. Many employees feel powerless to stop or report such behavior when doing so might pose a threat to their career opportunities and economic welfare. Theriseofthe #MeToo movement in the fall of 2017 revealed the per- vasiveness of sexual misconduct in entertainment, media, politics, aca- demia, and business. An ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 30 percent of women had experienced unwanted sexual advances at work, while an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey put the number at 35 percent (McGregor 2017). The outpouring of #MeToo disclosures empowered employees in many industries—from migrant farmworkers and hotel housekeeping staff to Wall Street ﬁnancial executives and Sili- con Valley software engineers—to come forward with sexual harassment complaints. As a result of these allegations, dozens of high-proﬁle busi- ness leaders faced career repercussions, including Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick, union leaders Caleb Jennings and Scott Courtney, sports exec- utive Terdema Ussery, and venture capitalists Shervin Pishevar, Dave McClure, and Justin Caldbeck. Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 83 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 84 The #MeToo Movement Employers Face New Legal and Ethical Responsibilities In the #MeToo era, companies faced added pressure to investigate sexual misconduct allegations fully and hold perpetrators accountable. Companies that ignored the problem came under criticism from #MeToo supporters and exposed themselves to negative publicity, legal liability, and ﬁnancial costs. “Every company and organization is going to have to change now,” leadership expert Gloria Feldt wrote in Time. “Leaders can make that change happen intentionally in ways that add value to their companies, or it will be imposed upon them by external forces and perhaps not in a way that’s positive for their businesses” (Feldt 2018). #MeToo supporters argued that businesses stood to beneﬁt by eliminat- ing sexual harassment. In addition to causing psychological harm to employees, they pointed out, workplace sexual harassment cost companies money both directly, through damage awards and legal fees, and indirectly, through lower productivity, higher turnover, and a disengaged workforce. In many ﬁrms, #MeToo prompted upper management to treat sexual harassment as a serious business risk, along the same lines as security or hacking. Many companies responded to the risk by strengthening their anti-harassment policies and training programs. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) reported a fourfold increase in usage of the educational resources on its website in the months after the Harvey Weinstein scandal launched the #MeToo movement (Natour 2018). In the past, many companies used training programs that focused on the legal deﬁnition of sexual harassment and speciﬁed workplace behaviors to avoid. Many companies administered these programs only to new employ- ees through online modules that they completed individually. Coupled with anti-harassment policies listed in an employee handbook, these pro- grams were mainly intended to insulate companies from liability in harass- ment lawsuits. Research suggested that such training did little to prevent workplace sexual harassment, partly because the problem did not stem from a lack of knowledge. “Do you really think that educated grown men need to be taught not to grope their co-workers?” said psychologist Louise Fitzgerald. “The fact that people don’t know, well, that is nonsense” (Natour 2018). In the wake of the #MeToo disclosures, such companies as Uber, Fox News, and NBC revamped their anti-harassment training programs to include in-person, small-group discussion sessions, which they held on a regular basis and made mandatory for all employees. Instead of focusing on prohibited behavior, the sessions aimed to build a corporate culture that valued fairness, diversity, respect, and civility. Some programs included COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC bystander intervention training, which provided coworkers with productive tools to use when they witnessed inappropriate or offensive workplace con- duct. Many companies also worked to improve their reporting procedures to make it easier for employees to come forward with complaints without fear of retaliation. For instance, some businesses introduced mobile apps or online platforms to facilitate anonymous reporting of sexual harassment or gender discrimination in the workplace. Critics questioned whether these measures did enough to create safe work environments where employees felt empowered to report harassment. “We believe effective training can reduce workplace harassment,” wrote the authors of an EEOC assessment. “However, even effective training cannot occur in a vacuum—it must be part of a holistic culture of non- harassment that starts at the top” (Feldblum and Lipnic 2016). To achieve meaningful, systemic change, critics argued that companies and their lead- ers—especially men—needed to publicly support the broader goals of the #MeToo movement, such as eliminating the use of nondisclosure agree- ments, forced arbitration, and conﬁdential settlements. Critics charged that these legal maneuvers silenced victims of workplace harassment in the interest of protecting the company’s reputation. In December 2017, Micro- soft garnered praise from #MeToo activists by announcing that it would no longer require its employees to submit to conﬁdential arbitration. Women Face Challenges in the Workplace In addition to drawing public attention to sexual misconduct in the workplace, the #MeToo movement highlighted persistent inequities in pay, positions, and promotion opportunities for working women. Some activists argued that the basic workplace dynamic that allowed women to be objectiﬁed, disrespected, and harassed would only change when more women attained positions of power in the business world. “It’spos- sible that we’re missing the bigger picture altogether: that this is not, at its heart, about sex at all,” wrote journalist Rebecca Traister. “What it’s really about is work, and women’s equality in the workplace, and more broadly, aboutthe rotatthe core of ourpower structures that makesitharderfor womentodoworkbecause thewhole thingistippedtowardmen” (McGregor 2017). To support their position, activists pointed to studies showing that com- panies with higher percentages of women in upper management earned more money, made decisions more effectively, and responded better to competitive pressure. Since women are responsible for 70–80 percent of consumer purchasing decisions, they argued that increasing the number Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 85 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 86 The #MeToo Movement of women in leadership roles could also help companies understand and react to changing markets (Feldt 2018). Equal pay for equal work was another major priority of women’s rights advocates, who noted that female employees typically received 80 cents for every dollar paid to male employ- ees. One survey of human resources executives found that nearly half of companies planned to adjust their pay policies to achieve greater wage par- ity for male and female employees. Analysts attributed this trend to social pressure resulting from the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements (Carpenter 2018). In March 2018, Starbucks announced that it had achieved the goal of 100 percent gender pay equity for its U.S. employees. Critics, on the other hand, argued that #MeToo had a negative impact on businesses by destroying the professional camaraderie between men and women in the workplace. They claimed that the heightened awareness of sexual harassment encouraged women to view men’s behavior as suspicious and predatory, creating an unproductive atmosphere of fear, distrust, and division. Many male employees expressed concern about facing harassment allegations on the basis of behavior they considered friendly and harmless, such as celebrating an accomplishment with a hug. Researchers found evidence to support the idea that the #MeToo era pro- duced a chilling effect on workplace relations. The effect was particularly pronounced in mentoring relationships between men in senior manage- ment and women in junior positions. A February 2018 survey conducted by the Lean In initiative found that the percentage of male executives who felt uncomfortable about mentoring female colleagues had tripled since before the Weinstein scandal. In another survey, nearly two-thirds of male managers acknowledged limiting their one-on-one interactions with female employees to avoid rumors, misunderstandings, or false allegations (Thom- son 2018). “It’s an incredibly dangerous message that women are almost black widow spiders waiting to catch their prey and a man should not be alone with a woman unless he has a guardian to protect him,” said employ- ment lawyer Jonathan Segal (Natour 2018). #MeToo supporters noted that such attitudes had the effect of segregat- ing employees by gender, which amounted to gender discrimination. They argued that the loss of mentoring opportunities had the potential to set back women’s career advancement. To preserve access to mentors for female employees, experts suggested that companies formalize mentoring relation- ships and designate spaces for mentors to meet protégés for lunch or coffee. In the end, according to Harvard Business School professor Robin Ely, the task of breaking patterns of behavior and changing corporate cultures falls to business leaders. “It’s not something you can legislate with policy,” she said. “It’s something that leaders need to take up as their own agenda, to COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC really be invested in understanding how people experience the culture of the organization, a culture that they, as leaders, are responsible for, whether they like it or not” (Pazzanese and Walsh 2017).

On October 15, 2017—10 days after a parade of female celebrities began coming forward to accuse Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct—the actress and activist asked her Twitter followers to reply “Me Too” if they had ever experienced sexual harassment or assault. By early November, Twitter data indicated that the hashtag had appeared in 2.3 million tweets that originated from 85 different countries (Fox and Diehm 2017). Social media users around the world quickly adapted the phrase to ﬁt their own languages and Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 87 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 88 The #MeToo Movement cultures. Some of the trending hashtags included #YoTambien (“I as well”) in Spanish, #BalanceTonPorc (“expose your pig”) in French, and #quella- voltache (“that time when”) in Italian. In China, where social media usage is subject to censorship, some inventive people posted responses using the hashtag #RiceBunny, which sounds like “Me Too” in Chinese. As the #MeToo movement spread, it created a global community of women who felt empowered to share their personal accounts of enduring catcalls, lewd gestures, propositions, pinching, groping, coercion, sexual abuse, or rape. The outpouring of stories made it clear that sexual harass- ment and assault were pervasive problems worldwide. In Egypt, for in- stance, surveys showed that 99 percent of women experienced some form of sexual harassment. The situation was almost as bad for women in Brazil, where 86 percent reported experiencing unwanted sexual comments or advances in public (Senthillingham 2017). Men’s attitudes about power, control, and entitlement played a role in the prevalence of sexual harass- ment in various countries. In Egypt, 62 percent of men found it acceptable for employers to expect sexual favors as a job requirement. In the United Kingdom, 36 percent of men between the ages of 25 and 34 found it accept- able to pinch a female coworker’s rear end (Nunn 2018). International #MeToo Movements Although the #MeToo movement had its greatest impact in the United States, it generated signiﬁcant public attention and precipitated legal and social changes in other countries, as well. In Great Britain, for example, investigative journalists with the Financial Times revealed that prominent business execu- tives routinely harassed and groped the female servers at an annual men’s charity gala, which convinced organizers to cancel the event. In addition, #MeToo activists circulated an anonymous, crowdsourced spreadsheet known as the Westminster Dossier that contained allegations of sexual misconduct against dozens of government ministers and members of Parliament. Although critics questioned the methods used to produce the document, the accusations of sexual harassment prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary Michael Fallon. A similar situation arose in India when Raya Sarkar, a law student at the University of California–Davis, collected a “cautionary list” of alleged sex- ual predators in Indian academia. Critics argued that the anonymous charges unfairly ruined men’s reputations and careers without giving them an oppor- tunity to defend themselves. Sarkar claimed that she merely elevated the voi- ces of victims within a system that protected perpetrators. In France, the #MeToo movement prompted government ofﬁcials to propose new legislation on sexual harassment. One bill under COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC consideration would impose ﬁnes on men who engaged in catcalling. The measures generated tremendous controversy in France, where some women considered vigorous and vocal romantic pursuits by men to be culturally acceptable. In January 2018, nearly 100 prominent French women—including the actress Catherine Deneuve—signed a letter in Le Monde denouncing #MeToo supporters as “puritanical” and charging that they equated “an awkward attempt to pick someone up” with sexual assault (Safronova 2018). The signers claimed that the movement por- trayed women as helpless victims who were incapable of advocating for their own rights and interests. The letter generated an outpouring of con- demnation on social media, with critics arguing that the signers trivialized sexual violence. The #MeToo movement took hold in Australia when investigative journalist Tracey Spicer invited her followers on social media to discuss their experiences with sexual harassment in the media industry. Nearly 1,000 women responded, revealing the pervasiveness of the problem in Australian culture. “Globalization, connectivity, and the women’srights movement have created the perfect storm,” Spicer stated. “Suddenly, we realize we’re not alone. And our experiences are being believed. For the ﬁrst time, men are understanding what women have suffered for centuries” (Crary 2018). Dozens of women—including Olympic medal-winning Australian swimmer Susie O’Neill—came forward to accuse television personality Don Burke, the host of a popular garden- ing program, of sexual misconduct spanning two decades. Although Burke denied the charges, the scandal launched a national conversation about sexual harassment that many people viewed as long overdue. “Senior federal politicians, board members, and executives are calling with ideas about how we change the culture,” Spicer noted. “This inves- tigation—and its consequences—will continue for many years to come” (Overington 2017). Journalist Shiori Ito launched the #MeToo reckoning in Japan when she publicly accused a well-known television correspondent, Noriyuki Yamagu- chi, of rape—a topic that was never discussed in Japanese society. “My com- ing forward made national news and shocked the public,” she wrote in Politico. “The backlash hit me hard. I was viliﬁed on social media and received hate messages and emails and calls from unknown numbers” (Ito 2018). Although Yamaguchi denied the charges, Ito’s disclosure prompted many other women to come forward. The public attention surrounding the allegations contributed to some changes in Japanese law, including the introduction of measures broadening the deﬁnition of rape and increasing minimum sentences for sex crimes. Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 89 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 90 The #MeToo Movement The impact of the #MeToo social media campaign was blunted in China, where censors reacted strongly to restrict citizens’ participation in “foreign” movements or any discussion of sexual assault. Following the Weinstein scandal, however, U.S.-based academic Luo Xixi came for- ward to accuse a renowned Chinese professor of sexual misconduct. When students in China added their own allegations, university ofﬁcials ﬁred the professor in question and launched investigations into the behavior of several other academics. Although the incident raised public awareness of the problem of sexual harassment, #MeToo supporters questioned whether Chinese women could sustain the momentum in the face of government resistance. Amplifying the Voices of Working Women Activists involved in international humanitarian and women’s rights issues sought to extend the #MeToo movement’s global reach to include low-wage workers in developing countries. They asserted that poverty and inequality made women more vulnerable to sexual violence, yet less likely to have access to resources and support to combat it. While the #MeToo social media cam- paign helped improve working conditions for celebrities in Hollywood, some observers questioned whether it had any impact on the lives of ordinary women working in ﬁelds, factories, and hotels around the world. To address this situation, some prominent activists called on the International Labor Organization (ILO) to pass a global convention deﬁning and prohibiting workplace sexual harassment and violence. They claimed that an ILO convention would provide an important tool to help spread the impact of the #MeToo movement to more women. “It’s about solidarity across all kinds of boundaries—rich or poor, black or white, North or South,” said international development expert Anne Marie Goetz. “If you get an explosion of #MeToo, you start getting the protection of numbers, and a growing mass of evidence that there’s a real problem—not just one individual making this up” (Crary 2018).

The move- ment began in October 2017, when dozens of celebrities came forward to accuse Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, and expanded over the next few months to ensnare prominent ﬁgures in the worlds of business, technology, politics, media, and academia. By early 2018, however, the focus of the #MeToo conversation shifted to include appropriate behavior in the context of dating and relationships. As the ﬂood of revelations raised awareness of the pervasiveness of sexual misconduct and its traumatic impact on women’s lives, many men began to reexamine their attitudes, expectations, and behavior in romantic and sexual encoun- ters. Aziz Ansari Allegations Shift the Conversation Controversial allegations against comedian Aziz Ansari—known as an outspoken supporter of the #MeToo movement—served as the impetus for a public debate about coercion and consent in dating relationships. A woman using the ﬁctitious name Grace told the feminist website Babe about a September 2017 date with Ansari that she described as “by far the worst experience with a man I’ve ever had.” Grace stated she and Ansari went Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 91 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 92 The #MeToo Movement out to dinner and then back to his apartment, where they engaged in sexual activity. Grace claimed that Ansari repeatedly pressured her for sex, even though she felt uncomfortable and did not welcome his advances. By the time she left the apartment, Grace felt shaken and violated, and she texted Ansari the next day to tell him so. “Last night might’ve been fun for you, but it wasn’t for me,” she stated. “You ignored clear non-verbal cues; you kept going with advances. You had to have noticed I was uncomfortable.… I want to make sure you’re aware so maybe the next girl doesn’thaveto cry ontheridehome” (Way 2018). Grace decided to tell her story in January 2018, after Ansari appeared at the Golden Globe Awards wearing a Time’s Up pin, which she considered hypocritical and “cringeworthy.” Ansari responded to her allegations by issuing a public statement expressing his view that their sexual encounter “by all indications was completely consensual.” Ansari acknowledged that Grace had texted him the next day to say, “although ‘it may have seemed okay,’ upon further reﬂection, she felt uncomfortable,” and that he responded to her message by apologizing. “It was true that everything did seem okay to me, so when I heard that it was not the case for her, I was sur- prised and concerned,” he stated. “I took her words to heart.” Ansari con- cluded his statement by expressing his continued support for the #MeToo movement, which he called “necessary and long overdue” (Way 2018). The Babe article went viral online—attracting 2.5 million views within a week—and generated an outpouring of commentary on social media. Many women recognized Ansari’s alleged predatory behavior as all too common among the men they dated. Opinions varied, however, about whether the encounter Grace described constituted sexual assault or merely a bad date. Critics charged that Grace could have expressed her objections verbally or simply left Ansari’s apartment if she found his advances too aggressive or per- sistent. They pointed out that Ansari held no power over Grace’s career, so his actions did not ﬁt into the same category as the abuses perpetrated by Wein- stein and others exposed by #MeToo. New York Times writer Bari Weiss found Ansari’s alleged actions to be selﬁsh, entitled, and obnoxious but asserted that Ansari did not deserve to have his reputation and career ruined for the crime of “not being a mind reader.” Weiss warned that the Babe article could also damage the campaign against sexual misconduct, calling it “arguably the worst thing that has happened to the #MeToo movement since it began in October. It transforms what ought to be a movement for women’s empowerment into an emblem for female helplessness” (Weiss 2018). Some #MeToo supporters, on the other hand, argued that if Ansari failed to respect Grace’s boundaries, then his conduct qualiﬁed as sexual assault. They asserted that he had a responsibility to check for consent at multiple COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC points during their sexual encounter, and that he should have stopped in the absence of a positive response indicating her free and enthusiastic agree- ment to participate. Even if society considered pressure, coercion, and manipulation to be commonplace, stereotypical masculine behavior, sup- porters said the #MeToo movement clearly demonstrated that such actions did not necessarily lead to positive sexual experiences for women. “It is the sheer commonness of Grace’s experience that makes it so important to talk about,” Caroline Framke wrote in Vox. “What else is this reckoning for, if not to break down the norms that let sexual coercion ﬂourish in the ﬁrst place?” (Framke 2018). Impact of #MeToo on the Dating Scene The disclosures of the #MeToo movement created an opportunity for peo- ple to engage in broader discussions about acceptable conduct in romantic relationships. In a January 2018 MTV survey of 1,800 single men and women between the ages of 18 and 25, 85 percent of respondents said that the #MeToo campaign had started an important conversation about sexual harass- ment and assault, while 55 percent said that they had talked about those topics more frequently in the months since it began. “We were encouraged to see the real impact the #MeToo movement is having among young people,” said MTV researcher Noopur Agarwal. “They are re-examining past behavior, re-thinking the way they approach romantic relationships, and noticing others changing around them. These shifts really help underscore the power of real stories and open dialogue” (Lusinski 2018). Some women approached dating more cautiously after seeing a seem- ingly endless stream of #MeToo stories in the news or in their social media feeds. For survivors of sexual assault, the #MeToo revelations sometimes triggered unpleasant memories of traumatic incidents from the past. Other women felt overwhelmed or frightened by the prevalence of sexual miscon- duct, which made dating seem like a dangerous endeavor. On the other hand, many women felt empowered by the #MeToo reckoning. They saw women’s concerns being taken seriously, which gave them greater conﬁ- dence that the men they dated would treat them with respect. The #MeToo movement left many men feeling uncertain, confused, and hesitant about how to proceed in the realm of dating and relationships. As women spoke out about their experiences, it forced many men to look back on their own behavior in a new way. According to the MTV survey, one- third of young male respondents expressed concern that something they had done in the past could be perceived as sexual harassment (Lusinski 2018). In the post-#MeToo dating landscape, men worried about Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 93 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 94 The #MeToo Movement recognizing social cues, crossing boundaries, having their actions misinter- preted, and being accused of behaving inappropriately. “#MeToo has done a tremendous job of breaking barriers and exposing some of the most hor- rid offenders, but in some ways, it has created a culture of ‘guilty until proven innocent,’” Brendan Pringle argued in the Washington Examiner. “Any woman can claim that a man has ‘harassed’ her, and people are inclined to accept it as true without any proof whatsoever. Generally speak- ing, this has caused men on the dating scene to tread ultra-cautiously” (Pringle 2018). Some critics charged that the #MeToo movement “inadvertently fostered a culture of fear in the dating scene” by creating confusion about appropri- ate conduct (Petter 2018). The MTV survey revealed that 68 percent of young people felt unclear about what behaviors constituted sexual harass- ment (Lusinski 2018). This uncertainty made people less inclined to approach and interact with one another for fear of breaking the rules or causing offense. Some critics claimed that #MeToo had a “chilling effect” on dating by making it dull, businesslike, superﬁcial, and politically correct (Paul 2018). They complained about a loss of spontaneity and romance, such as when couples felt the need to ask permission before engaging in their ﬁrst kiss. “In the #MeToo era, it seems that millennials have fallen vic- tim to their own wokeness and catchy social media hashtags,” Pringle asserted (Pringle 2018). Changing Attitudes and Behaviors #MeToo supporters dismissed critics’ concerns about the movement’s impact on romantic relationships as overblown. They viewed the re- examination of men’s past behavior as a positive development that had the potential to make dating safer and more equitable in the future. They also asserted that communication could help men and women establish boun- daries and avoid inappropriate dating behavior. “It is pretty easy to know what actions would constitute sexual harassment,” said one writer. “If you analyze situations and are aware of your own character in any way, you don’t really accidentally do any of these things. If you are trying to build a better relationship with all of this happening the key is communication” (Paul 2018). #MeToo supporters suggested a variety of good dating practices to help men avoid crossing the line into sexual misconduct. One important prac- tice, as Ansari’s experience demonstrated, involves paying attention to non- verbal signals indicating that a woman may not reciprocate romantic interest or welcome sexual advances, such as avoiding eye contact, COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC appearing uncomfortable or nervous, and moving away from a physical touch. Verbal cues may also provide insight into a partner’s state of mind during a date or sexual encounter. If a partner’s comments indicate hesita- tion or displeasure, even in an indirect or ambiguous way, asking questions and obtaining verbal permission is the safest and most respectful way to proceed. “Our bodies are zoned,” Laura Kipnis explained in the Guardian. “There are public areas and private ones; parts you can touch without per- mission, such as my hand, and parts you’re trespassing if you encroach on them without my permission” (Kipnis 2018). The #MeToo movement generated signiﬁcant debate about the concept of consent. For sexual activity to be considered consensual, both parties must willingly and deliberately give their approval to participate. In rela- tionships between men and women, #MeToo activists pointed out, the bal- ance of power is often weighted toward men, whether due to workplace status or physical strength. This unequal power dynamic has implications for consent. If a woman participates in sexual activity to avoid career reper- cussions or physical danger, her participation may be voluntary but not consensual. #MeToo activists noted that men can avoid such situations by repeatedly seeking afﬁrmative consent as well as explicitly offering their sex- ual partners permission to say no. Open communication provides both par- ties in dating relationships with assurances that their feelings and expressions are reciprocated.

Many men responded to the accusations by issuing public apologies for their past behavior. Some observers of the #MeToo movement’scultural fallout analyzed the apologies, critiquing their content, tone, and likely impact on victims’ feelings and the broader conversation about sexual misconduct. While a few of the apologies received praise for seeming heartfelt and sincere, many others met with criticism for appearing dis- ingenuous or conditional. “They’re sleazy, self-serving, vague, mind- bending, gaslighting,” said psychologist Harriet Lerner, author of Why Won’t You Apologize? Healing Big Betrayals and Everyday Hurts. “There’s no accountability, and they make every apology mistake that one could make” (Orso 2017). Experts note that apologies, when handled well, have the potential to aid the healing process for victims of sexual harassment. Honest, heartfelt apol- ogies conﬁrm the accuracy of their accounts, acknowledge their injuries, and provide the opportunity for closure on their traumatic experiences. Public apologies also offer potential beneﬁts to society by sparking public debate, demonstrating the pervasiveness of the problem, and making it eas- ier for victims to come forward in the future. When apologies are handled poorly, however, they give perpetrators a platform to present their viewpoint and excuse their behavior while mini- mizing the experiences of survivors and making them feel silenced. Rather than healing wounds, insincere nonapologies can promote victim-blaming and make it more difﬁcult for victims to come forward. “Humans are wired for defensiveness,” Lerner stated. “It’s very hard for us to take clear and direct responsibility for speciﬁc things we have said or done—or not said or done—without a hint of blaming, obfuscation, excuse-making [or] bringing up the other person’s crime sheet” (Ulaby 2017). COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC Good and Bad Apologies According to sociologist David Karp, good apologies must include a clear, speciﬁc statement of the wrongdoing and harm caused. Many of the public apologies offered by celebrities in response to #MeToo disclosures made only vague, generalized references to their inappropriate conduct. For example, Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein said “Iappreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain,” while television journalist Charlie Rose said “I have behaved insensitively at times” (North 2017). Scholars of human behavior assert that in addition to including explicit admissions of guilt and acknowledgments of responsibility, good apologies are given without conditions, qualiﬁcations, or denials. Victims of sexual harassment or assault emphasize that their abusers need to take full owner- ship of their actions. “When men say sorry, it shouldn’t be shrouded in, ‘I was young and stupid and drunk’ or ‘I had no idea’ or ‘I misread the signals,’” said one victim. “It should be a full admission that they behaved in a way that they see now was hurtful and/or damaging” (Fetters 2018). In January 2018, for example, Dan Harmon, creator of the television show Community, used his own podcast to issue a public apology to Com- munity writer Megan Ganz for his “selﬁsh,”“cowardly,” and “cruel” behavior toward her after she rejected his romantic advances. “What’srefreshing [about his apology],” wrote journalist Marissa Martinelli, “is that Harmon explains the ways he thought and acted at the time without making excuses or throwing himself a pity party. Instead, he uses the entire experience to urge others to consider their own actions and attitudes toward women in the workplace.” For her part, Ganz publicly forgave Harmon for what he himself described as months of “creeping” on her. She even described his remarks as a “masterclass in How to Apologize” (Martinelli 2018). In his apology, Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota discussed a particular photograph in which he appeared to be grabbing the breasts of a female entertainer during a 2006 USO tour. Franken accepted responsibil- ity, validated the woman’s feelings, and expressed remorse. “Idon’tknow what was in my head when I took that picture, but that doesn’t matter,” he wrote. “There’s no excuse and I understand why you could feel violated by that photo” (Ulaby 2017). By afﬁrming their victims’ credibility, these men increased the likelihood that the public would believe women who came forward in the future. In many cases, however, statements issued by men accused of sexual har- assment have minimized the harm caused by their behavior or challenged the accuracy of the charges leveled against them. Television journalist Matt Impacts of the #MeToo Movement 97 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 98 The #MeToo Movement Lauer qualiﬁed his apology by saying, “Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.” Similarly, Mark Halperin of ABC News stated, “In almost every case, I have recognized conduct for which I feel profound guilt and responsibility,” but added that “some of the allegations that have been made against me are not true” (North 2017). Partial denials raise doubts about the veracity of accusers’ reports, leaving the public to debate about which elements are true or false. Other prominent men accused of sexual misconduct have made excuses or attempted to deﬂect public attention away from the allegations. Wein- stein claimed that his attitudes toward women had simply failed to keep up with changing times. “Icameof age in the ‘60s and ‘70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different,” he wrote (Orso 2017). Spokespeople for former president George H. W. Bush, who was accused of groping women during photo opportunities, claimed that the women misunderstood his actions. “At age 93, President Bush has been conﬁned to a wheelchair for roughly ﬁve years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures,” the statement read (Orso 2017). Radio host Garrison Keillor insisted that his hand accidentally slipped inside a colleague’s blouse as he patted her back. He also discounted the woman’s feelings by claiming that at least 100 women had allowed their hands to “drift down below the beltline” while taking selﬁes with him over the years (Silva 2017). One of the public apologies that generated the most intense criticism came from actor Kevin Spacey, who was accused of molesting actor Anthony Rapp and several other young men. Spacey claimed not to remem- ber the incident, speculated that he must have been drunk, and then cast doubt on Rapp’s report by stating, “If I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology” (Silva 2017). Spacey concluded his statement by coming out as gay, thus diverting media attention away from the past allegations and shifting it to his revelation about his sexual orienta- tion. He came under ﬁre from many people in the LGBTQ community for conﬂating sexual misconduct with homosexuality and thus contributing to stereotypes of gay men as sexual predators. Many famous men also made the mistake of expecting their apologies to result in forgiveness and the restoration of their reputations and careers. Experts contend that apologies made in good faith should never demand forgiveness or request anything else from the harmed party. Weinstein com- mitted that error by asking for a “second chance” in the ﬁlm industry (North 2017). Advocates for women emphasize that the act of apologizing for COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC sexual harassment and other misconduct does not guarantee absolution. Instead, the victim has the right to determine whether and when to accept an apology and forgive an offense. Another common mistake made by famous men in #MeToo apologies involved self-promotion. Many accused men ﬂattered themselves by declaring their respect for women, citing their credentials as a feminist ally, or mention- ing their support for gender equality. Weinstein’s statement, for instance, made note of the scholarship fund he established for women interested in studying ﬁlm direction. “Basically, it’s a performance,” Lerner stated. “It’s an act of self-protection, an attempt to do damage control, to save one’sreputation” (Ulaby 2017). Good apologies, on the other hand, avoid self- aggrandizement and express a genuine desire to make amends for past behav- ior and to make positive changes going forward. Although many of the statements made in response to #MeToo allega- tions fell short of the requirements of a good apology, the critique sur- rounding them helped promote the goals of the movement by clarifying social expectations of behavior and establishing new public norms. “No apology will ever be completely pure. Self-interest—whether professional, ﬁnancial, emotional, or spiritual—is always wired in,” Katy Waldman wrote in Slate. “Perhaps the question is whether the listeners are ready to mend broken ties, to allow the apologizer to try to become a better person” (Wald- man 2017).
