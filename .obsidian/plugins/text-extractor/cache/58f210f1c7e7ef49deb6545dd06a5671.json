Am I correct that I am not required to pay that until my TANF benefit expires?

These have been removed from your case. Your remaining balance is $350. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. LisaMarie, Thank you for the call yesterday. I wanted to follow up by email, since our connection was so poor on the phone. I have an appointment with an attorney next Friday to discuss the matter of when my accrual and payment should have been suspended. As I understand the statues, I should not be expected to pay anything after receiving my TANF benefit. I understand that there might be an amount due, but it would only be collected in two circumstances. 1. I decide to pay voluntarily 2. I am no longer receiving TANF benefits Given this, I believe DESR was mistaken in reporting this as past due to the credit agencies. I would like to request that you suspend further reporting to credit agencies until I have spoken with legal council. If this is not possible, I would like to request a hearing as soon as possible to discuss my ability to pay. As you know I am a single parent supporting my daughter 50% while on TANF. I am significantly below the poverty line and simply cannot afford to pay child or spousal support. The negative impact on my reputation and credit can only hurt my ability to fulfill these obligations, and will almost certainly put me at a disadvantage as I attempt to secure employment.
