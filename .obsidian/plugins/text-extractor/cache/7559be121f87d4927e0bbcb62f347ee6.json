Newins 2 Abstract The present study examined the roles of sexual victimization history, sexism toward women, and sexism toward men in the gender difference in rape myth acceptance. The data were obtained from 2,011 male and female college students who completed an online survey. The results suggested that gender had a signiﬁcant indirect effect on rape myth acceptance via sexual assault history and several forms of sexist beliefs. The ﬁndings supported the importance of considering additional antecedents of rape myths in research, as well as in programming geared toward preventing sexual assault and improving support for survivors. Keywords sexual violence, rape myth, ambivalent sexism, sex roles, victim blame Introduction Sexual assault, deﬁned as unwanted sexual contact or penetration obtained either through force (or threat of force) or incapacitation (Muehlenhard et al., 2017), is a per- vasive form of violence that affects millions of individuals in the United States every year (Krebs et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2018). Furthermore, national data suggest that 24.8% of men and 43.6% of women experience contact sexual violence during their lifetime (Smith et al., 2018). Speciﬁc to higher education, approximately 20% of women and 6% of men indicate that they experienced attempted or completed sexual assault during their time in college (Krebs et al., 2007; Muehlenhard et al., 2017). 1Department of Psychological Science, University of Mary Washington, Fredericksburg, VA, USA 2Department of Psychology, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA Corresponding Author: Laura C.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine several potential antecedents to rape myth acceptance (RMA). One area of heightened concern among scholars and practitioners is that many sexual assault survivors do not seek care nor report the crime, which may limit their access to resources or services that could facilitate their recovery (Newins & Wilson, 2021; Ullman et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2010). Furthermore, crime reporting is particularly attenuated among college students, with only 20% of student survivors reporting their assault to police compared to 32% of non-student survivors (Sinozich & Langton, 2014). When asked about barriers to disclosure, sexual assault survivors indi- cate that fears of victim blaming and disbelief are among the main reasons they do not disclose (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2006; Ullman et al., 2020). Cultural beliefs that shift the blame for sexual assault from perpetrators to survivors or minimize the seriousness of rape are driven by rape myths (Brownmiller, 1975; Burt, 1980) or “attitudes and beliefs that are generally false but widely and persistently held, and that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression against women” (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1994, p. 134). These “prejudicial, stereotyped, or false beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists” (Burt, 1980, p. 217) lead to subjective parameters for what is considered real rape, as well as assumptions about the factors that contribute to rape or the likely consequences of rape (van der Bruggen & Grubb, 2014). Prior research has generally found that men exhibit greater RMA than women (e.g., Martini & De Piccoli, 2020; McMahon & Farmer, 2011; Suarez & Gadalla, 2010) and that men’s greater RMA accounts for their more negative reactions toward sexual assault survivors (e.g., victim blaming; Hammond et al., 2011). Although this “ubiq- uitous gender effect” (Angelone et al., 2021, p. 749) has been documented across numerous studies, less is known about the mechanisms that may account for these gender differences. Existing literature has proposed that sexism may be an antecedent to rape myths because sexist ambivalence is “the ‘stick and carrot’ that keep women in line in a patri- archal society” and “justify male power” over women (Chapleau et al., 2007, p. 132). Glick and Fiske (1996) conceptualized ambivalent sexism toward women as two sets of related beliefs: hostile and benevolent sexism. Hostile sexism (i.e., “the stick”) involves overt and traditional forms of sexism, such as the disapproval of women who defy traditional gender roles (Glick & Fiske, 1996). Conversely, benevolent sexism (i.e., “the carrot”) involves less obvious sexism that may seem positive in tone, but ulti- mately restricts or demeans women (Glick & Fiske, 1996). For example, hostile sexism may involve a man commenting that a female coworker must have had sexual intercourse with the boss to obtain her current job. Whereas, benevolent sexism may involve a man assuming a female coworker needs help with a physical task. Although men tend to expe- rience higher levels of hostile sexism toward women than women do, women do endorse both benevolent and hostile sexist attitudes toward other women (Glick et al., 2000). Using factor analysis, Glick and Fiske (1996) found evidence that hostile sexism is a unitary construct and benevolent sexism has three sub-factors (see Table 1 for a Wilson and Newins 3033 description of each type of sexism toward women and example items). Chapleau et al. (2007) found that hostile sexism was positively associated with and the strongest pre- dictor of RMA among both male and female participants. In terms of benevolent sexism toward women, they found that complementary gender differentiation (CGD) was positively associated with RMA and protective paternalism (PP) was negatively associated with RMA among both male and female participants. Conversely, hetero- sexual intimacy was not signiﬁcantly related to RMA. Thus, speciﬁc components of sexism may play unique roles in attitudes toward rape survivors. The most relevant atti- tudes may include beliefs about men’s dominance over others as justiﬁcation for sexual assault (i.e., positive correlation between hostile sexism and RMA), blaming the sur- vivor for their assault particularly if they are perceived as having violated traditional Table 1. Deﬁnitions and Example Items for Sexism Toward Women and Sexism Toward Men. Deﬁnition Example item from measure Sexism toward women: ambivalent sexism inventory (Glick & Fiske, 1996) Hostile Overt negative attitudes that justify men’s power by derogating women. “Women are too easily offended.” Protective paternalism Belief that men should serve as the provider and take care of women because they have access to societal power. “Women should be cherished and protected by men.” Complementary gender differentiation Belief that women possess traits that serve as complements to the traits of men. “Women, compared to men, tend to have a superior moral sensibility.” Heterosexual intimacy Belief that men have a need for women as romantic partners which causes men to be dependent on women. “No matter how accomplished he is, a man is not truly complete as a person unless he has the love of a woman.” Sexism toward men: ambivalence toward men inventory (Glick & Fiske, 1999) Hostile Overt negative attitudes whereby women resent the power and higher status held by men. “Men will always ﬁght to have greater control in society than women.” Maternalism Belief that women’s domestic role justiﬁes their reliance on men. “Women ought to take care of their men at home, because men would fall apart if they had to fend for themselves.” Complementary gender differentiation Belief that women’s admiration for the stereotypical traits of men further reinforces their power. “Men are more willing to take risks than women.” Heterosexual intimacy Belief that a woman’s life is incomplete unless she is in a romantic relationship with a man. “Every woman ought to have a man she adores.” 3034 Violence Against Women 30(11) gender norms (i.e., positive correlation between CGD and RMA), and perceiving more perpetrator responsibility for an assault if men are perceived as protectors (i.e., negative correlation between PP and RMA). Overall, prior research has suggested that sexism toward women is associated with perceiving men as the more powerful group, which in turn is associated with minimizing the seriousness of rape, excusing the per- petrator, and blaming the victim (Chapleau et al., 2007). Although these sexist beliefs are more often linked to attitudes about female survivors, they are also relevant to male survivors. Speciﬁcally, because viewing men as the more powerful group may relate to the myth that “real men cannot be raped,” these sexism attitudes likely also impact atti- tudes about male survivors. In further support of sexist attitudes toward women as antecedents to RMA, Angelone et al. (2021) demonstrated that sexism mediated the relationship between gender and RMA in a sample of college students. More speciﬁcally, they found that hostile sexism toward women and two subscales of benevolent sexism toward women (i.e., PP, CGD) were signiﬁcant pathways through which gender was associated with RMA. For hostile sexism and PP, men evidenced signiﬁcantly higher levels of those forms of sexism, which was then positively associated with RMA. For CGD, women evidenced signiﬁcantly higher levels, which was associated with RMA. The indirect association between gender and RMA via heterosexual intimacy was not signiﬁcant, which was similar to the non-signiﬁcant bivariate relationship in Chapleau et al. (2007). These ﬁnd- ings conﬁrmed existing literature that sexism toward women is an antecedent to rape myths (Burt, 1980; Chapleau et al., 2008; Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1995) and provided evi- dence of which domains are most relevant. This research on mechanisms helps to identify factors that should be targeted in programs designed to reduce RMA, which ultimately improves the support available to survivors. Although the majority of the existing studies have focused on sexist attitudes toward women, there is a parallel conceptualization of sexist attitudes toward men based on hostile and benevolent sexism (Glick & Fiske, 1999). More speciﬁcally, the theory articulates that women experience a conﬂict because they resent men for having more societal power but they must also rely on men (Chapleau et al., 2007; Glick & Fiske, 1999), which leads women to express their displeasure with the patriarchy (i.e., hostile sexism) while also fulﬁlling the expectations that women should take care of men (i.e., benevolent sexism; Glick & Fiske, 1999). Furthermore, although women tend to score higher than men on hostile sexism toward men, men tend to score higher on benevolent sexism toward men than women do (Glick et al., 2004). Although there are three subfactors of hostile sexism toward men (i.e., resentment of paternalism, compensatory gender differentiation, heterosexual hostility), we examined overall hostile sexism toward men to allow for consistency with the model we tested related to sexism toward women. Similar to the other model, we examined the three sub- factors of benevolent sexism toward men separately (see Table 1 for a description of each type of sexism toward men and example items). In terms of sexist attitudes toward men, Chapleau et al. (2007) found that the strongest predictor was the positive relationship between heterosexual intimacy and RMA among both male and female participants. CGD was positively associated with RMA in both male and female participants. Wilson and Newins 3035 Maternalism was positively associated with RMA but only in female participants. Conversely, hostile sexism was not signiﬁcantly associated with RMA in either male or female participants. It is important to note that some studies have found different results. For example, LeMaire et al. (2016) found that hostile sexism toward men was sig- niﬁcantly related to RMA, in addition to benevolent sexism toward men, hostile sexism toward women and benevolent sexism toward women. However, their sample was restricted to women who had experienced rape, which points to the importance of consid- ering gender differences as well as the potential inﬂuence of sexual victimization history. Given the prior research demonstrating that sexism toward men is relevant in terms of understanding attitudes toward rape survivors (e.g., Chapleau et al., 2007), one contribu- tion of the present study beyond that of Angelone et al. (2021) was that we examined both sexism toward women and sexism toward men as antecedents to rape myths. In addition to not considering sexist attitudes toward men, Angelone et al. (2021) also did not consider the potential inﬂuence of the participants’ victimization history. They identiﬁed this omission as one of the main limitations of their study. Not including victimization history is problematic because women are signiﬁcantly more likely to be victims of sexual assault compared to men (Smith et al., 2018). Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that a history of sexual victimization is associated with lower RMA (e.g., Miller et al., 2011; Vonderhaar & Carmody, 2015). Miller et al. (2011) suggested that this association is likely due to the perception of similarity or that sexual assault survivors may identify with the experiences of other survivors, which would increase empathy towards other survivors and lower RMA. Conversely, several studies have failed to ﬁnd a bivariate relationship between victim- ization history and RMA (e.g., Carmody & Washington, 2001; Cooke et al., 2022; Fansher & Zedaker, 2022; Muehlenhard & Linton, 1987). However, as stated by Heath et al., “Notably, most studies that assess RMA make no mention of previous vic- timization history” (2013, p. 1066). Therefore, given the inconsistent results among the few existing studies, the inclusion of sexual assault history was another important con- tribution of the present study. Speciﬁcally, we considered whether sexual victimization history may account for the gender differences in sexism. Current Study In the present study, we hypothesized indirect effects of gender via sexual assault history and sexism on RMA. Speciﬁcally, in terms of sexist attitudes toward women, we predicted: 1a. Women would be more likely than men to have experienced a sexual assault, survivors of sexual assault would report lower hostile sexism than individuals who did not experience a sexual assault, and hostile sexism would be positively associated with RMA. 1b. Women would be more likely than men to have experienced a sexual assault, survivors of sexual assault would report lower CGD than individuals who did not experience a sexual assault, and CGD would be positively associated with RMA. 3036 Violence Against Women 30(11) 1c. Women would be more likely than men to have experienced a sexual assault, survivors of sexual assault would report lower protective paternalism than individ- uals who did not experience a sexual assault, and protective paternalism would be positively associated with RMA. 1d. Consistent with Angelone et al. (2021) and Chapleau et al. (2007), the indirect effect of gender on RMA via sexual assault history and heterosexual intimacy would not be signiﬁcant. In terms of sexism toward men, we predicted: 2a. Women would be more likely than men to have experienced a sexual assault, survivors of sexual assault would report lower levels of heterosexual intimacy than individuals who did not experience a sexual assault, and heterosexual intimacy would be positively associated with RMA. 2b. Women would be more likely than men to have experienced a sexual assault, survivors of sexual assault would report lower levels of CGD than individuals who did not experience a sexual assault, and CGD would be positively associated with RMA. 2c. Women would be more likely than men to have experienced a sexual assault, survivors of sexual assault would report lower levels of maternalism than individ- uals who did not experience a sexual assault, and maternalism would be positively associated with RMA. 2d. Consistent with Chapleau et al. (2007), we hypothesized that the indirect effect of gender on RMA via sexual assault history and hostile sexism would not be signiﬁcant. Method Participants Undergraduate students at a large, public university in the southeastern United States were recruited via the Psychology Department’s study recruitment site. A total of 2,433 students began the survey. Participants who responded incorrectly to more than one reading validity item (n = 383) or were missing responses to more than 20% of the items on the questionnaires used in the present analyses (n = 18) were excluded. Additionally, participants who did not report their gender (n = 5) or iden- tiﬁed as transgender or identiﬁed outside of the gender binary (n = 16) were excluded. This decision was made because too few participants identiﬁed as trans- gender or non-binary in our sample to be able to conduct meaningful analyses. The ﬁnal sample included 2,011 participants. Samples of at least 1,000 participants have been shown to have power greater than .95 to detect small effects using product coefﬁcient methods (MacKinnon et al., 2002), indicating this sample provided ade- quate power to detect meaningful effects. Demographic information for the sample is presented in Table 2. Wilson and Newins 3037 Measures Demographics. Participants completed several demographic items, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and year in college. Gender was assessed Table 2.

The present study used a modiﬁed version of the SES-SFV (Koss et al., 2007) to determine which participants had experienced sexual assault since the age of 14. The participants were asked to respond either “yes” or no” to seven types of unwanted sexual experiences that could have occurred as a result of ﬁve different perpetrator tactics, resulting in a total of 35 items. The SES-SFV uses behaviorally speciﬁc language, which means that participants do not necessarily have to conceptualize an incident as “sexual assault” or “rape” to be able to select “yes” to any particular item. The use of behav- iorally speciﬁc language is important because prior research has found that the majority of rape survivors do not use the term “rape” to describe their victimization (i.e., unac- knowledged rape; Wilson & Miller, 2016). Participants completed each of the 35 items in response to (a) the past 12 months and (b) the time between their 14th birthday and 12 months before the study. For the purposes of the analyses, participants were classi- ﬁed as having experienced sexual assault if they endorsed any item during either time- frame on the SES-SFV. Johnson et al. (2017) demonstrated evidence for the reliability and validity of the SES-SFV for use with college women. Anderson et al. (2018) sug- gested that the reliability of the SES-SFV may be problematic among male partici- pants, but that study relied on a small sample size and did provide evidence of the convergent validity of the measure. We used the SES-SFV in the present study because it is still recognized as the gold standard self-report of sexual victimization history (Dworkin et al., 2017). Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI). Participants completed this 22-item self-report measure of sexism toward women. The ASI (Glick & Fiske, 1996) includes an 11-item subscale that assesses hostile sexism (ASI-H) and three subscales that assess benevolent sexism, including protective paternalism (ASI-PP; 4 items), complemen- tary gender differentiation (ASI-CGD; 3 items), and heterosexual intimacy (ASI-HI; 4 items). Participants were asked to respond to each item using a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (disagree strongly)to5(agree strongly). Participants’ responses on each of the subscales were averaged, and higher scores indicated greater agreement with the sexist statements. Glick and Fiske (1996) found evidence for the reliability and validity of the ASI when used with college participants. The Cronbach’s alpha of the hostile sexism subscale was .89, indicating good internal consistency; Cronbach’s alphas for the benevolent sexism subscales were accept- able (ASI-PP: α = .64; ASI-CGD: α = .73; ASI-HI: α = .70). It is possible that the Cronbach’s alphas for the benevolent sexism subscales are low because these sub- scales only included 3 to 4 items, and internal consistency is associated with number of items. Ambivalence Toward Men Inventory (ATMI). Participants completed this 20-item ques- tionnaire to assess their hostile and benevolent sexist beliefs about men. Participants Wilson and Newins 3039 were asked to respond to each item using a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (disagree strongly)to5(agree strongly). Similar to the ASI, the ATMI (Glick & Fiske, 1999) has a hostile sexism subscale (ATMI-H; 10 items) and three subscales that assess benevolent sexism, including maternalism (ATMI-M; 3 items), complemen- tary gender differentiation (ATMI-CGD; 3 items), and heterosexual intimacy (ATMI-HI; 4 items). The participants’ responses to the items on each subscale were averaged, and higher scores indicated greater agreement with the sexist statements. Glick and Fiske (1999) found evidence for the reliability and validity of the ATMI when used with college participants. Internal consistency was good for the hostile sexism subscale (α = .86) and acceptable to good for the three benevolent sexism sub- scales (ATMI-M: α = .74; ATMI-CGD: α = .75; ATMI-HI: α = .84). As noted for the Cronbach’s alphas for the benevolent sexism subscales of the ASI, these subscales of the ATMI likely had lower alpha values than the hostile sexism scale due to the number of items per subscale. Updated Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (U-IRMAS). Participants used a 1 (strongly agree)to5(strongly disagree) Likert scale to respond to 22 items assessing their agree- ment with myths about sexual violence. The U-IRMAS (McMahon & Farmer, 2011) consists of four subscales: (a) “She asked for it,” (b) “He didn’t mean to,” (c) “It wasn’t really rape,” and (d) “She lied.” Because of the purpose of this study, a total score was used. All items were reverse coded before the total score was com- puted so that higher scores indicated greater acceptance of rape myths. McMahon and Farmer (2011) demonstrated that the U-IRMAS is both reliable and valid when used with undergraduate participants. The Cronbach’s alpha in the present study was .93, indicating excellent internal consistency. Procedure The analyzed data were collected as part of a larger 60-minute online survey that was advertised as examining the relationship between experiences and beliefs. To be included in the larger survey, participants were required to be at least 18 years old. As compensation, participants received study participation credit. The institutional review board at the university where the study was conducted approved all study pro- cedures. Participants consented to participate by continuing on to the survey after being provided with information about study procedures. At the end of the survey, partici- pants were given contact information for services that were appropriate for sexual assault survivors. Statistical Analyses Descriptive statistics and correlations were computed in SPSS, Version 28. Path anal- yses were conducted in Mplus, Version 8.6 (Muthén & Muthén, 2021). Because sexual assault, a dichotomous variable, was included as a mediator in the model, the weighted least square mean and variance adjusted estimator was used with a probit link. 3040 Violence Against Women 30(11) Bootstrapped estimates of indirect effects and conﬁdence intervals were computed. Model ﬁt was determined by examining the result of the Chi-squared test of model ﬁt as well as additional ﬁt indices. For additional ﬁt indices, the following values were considered to indicate good ﬁt: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) ≤ .06, comparative ﬁt index (CFI) ≥ .95, Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) ≥ .95, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) ≤ .08 (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Results The descriptive statistics for the study variables are presented in Table 2. The bivariate correlations among the study variables are presented in Table 3. Women were more likely to experience sexual assault than men (i.e., 39.9% of women and 9.5% of men reported a history of sexual assault in this study). Women reported lower levels of hostile sexism toward women, two types of benevolent sexism toward women (i.e., PP, heterosexual intimacy), all three types of benevolent sexism toward men, and RMA than men; women reported higher levels of one type of benevolent sexism toward women (i.e., CGD) and hostile sexism toward men. Individuals who experienced a sexual assault reported lower levels of hostile sexism toward women, two types of benevolent sexism toward women (i.e., PP, heterosexual intimacy), all types of benevolent sexism toward men, and RMA than individuals who had not expe- rienced a sexual assault; individuals who experienced a sexual assault endorsed higher levels of hostile sexism toward men than individuals who had not experienced a sexual assault. Sexist Beliefs About Women The model including scores from the ASI ﬁt the data well, χ2(1) = 3.91, p = .048, RMSEA = .038, CFI = .999, TLI = .973, and SRMR = .007. The model explained 38.1% of the variance in scores on the U-IRMAS. Path coefﬁcients are presented in Figure 1. Total and indirect effects for the model are reported in Table 4. The indirect effects of gender via sexual assault and both ASI-H and ASI-HI on U-IRMAS scores were statistically signiﬁcant and negative (b = −.04, p = .025; b = −.01, p = .046, respectively), indicating women accepted rape myths less than men via these pathways. Speciﬁcally, women were more likely than men to have experienced a sexual assault (b = 1.05, p < .001), survivors of sexual assault reported lower levels of both hostile sexist beliefs toward women and heterosexual intimacy benevolent sexist beliefs toward women (b = −.08, p = .022; b = −.12, p = .001, respectively) than individuals who did not experience a sexual assault, and both of these types of sexist beliefs were positively associated with acceptance of rape myths (b = .48, p <.001; b = .06, p = .005, respectively). Additionally, there were signiﬁcant, negative indirect effects of gender on U-IRMAS via ASI-H and ASI-HI (b = −.21, p <.001; b = −.02, p = .013, respectively). These indirect effects indicate that women reported lower levels of both hostile sexist beliefs toward women and heterosexual intimacy benevolent sexist beliefs toward women (β = −.44, p <.001; β = −.27, p < .001, respectively) than Wilson and Newins 3041Table3.CorrelationsAmongStudyVariables.Variable12345678910111.Gender1.002.SexualAssault0.33**1.003.ASI-Hostile−0.25**−0.12**1.004.ASI-PP−0.18**−0.14*0.36**1.005.ASI-CGD0.12**−0.030.21**0.45**1.006.ASI-HI−0.18**−0.13**0.44**0.51**0.32**1.007.ATMI-Hostile0.25**0.09**0.19**0.33*0.58**0.30**1.008.ATMI-M−0.06*−0.08**0.50**0.50**0.46**0.50**0.56**1.009.ATMI-CGD−0.16**−0.10**0.56**0.41**0.39**0.42**0.37**0.54**1.0010.ATMI-HI−0.13**−0.12**0.51**0.53**0.39**0.73**0.41**0.64**0.54**1.0011.UpdatedIRMAS−0.36**−0.17**0.57**0.26**0.11**0.33**0.11**0.39**0.39**0.40**1.00Note:ASI=AmbivalentSexismInventory;ATMI=AmbivalenceTowardMenInventory;CGD=complementarygenderdifferentiation;HI=heterosexualintimacy;IRMAS=IllinoisRapeMythAcceptanceScale;M=maternalism;PP=protectivepaternalism;Genderwascoded0=Male,1=Female;SexualAssaultSinceAge14wascoded0=No,1=Yes.*p<.01.**p<.001. 3042 men, even after accounting for the effect of sexual assault history on sexist beliefs, and these sexist beliefs were positively associated with acceptance of rape myths, as noted above. None of the indirect paths from gender to U-IRMAS via ASI-PP or ASI-CGD were statistically signiﬁcant, regardless of whether sexual assault was included in the indirect path (ps > .50), which was likely driven by the fact that the paths from both ASI-PP and ASI-CGD to U-IRMAS were not statistically signiﬁcant (ps > .49). Finally, gender continued to have a signiﬁcant direct effect on U-IRMAS scores (b = −.46, p < .001), indicating the relationship between gender and RMA is not fully accounted for by sexual assault history and sexist beliefs toward women.

The indirect effect via ATMI-H indicates that women reported higher levels of hostile sexist beliefs toward men than men reported (b = .51, p < .001), and these sexist beliefs were negatively associated with acceptance of rape myths (β = −.08, p = .001).

Finally, gender continued to have a signiﬁcant direct effect on U-IRMAS scores (b = −.56, p < .001), indicating the relationship between gender and RMA is not fully accounted for by sexual assault history and sexist beliefs toward men.

Wilson and Newins 3045 The current study attempted to replicate and extend prior research by examining mech- anisms that may account for this gender difference. Existing evidence has demon- strated that hostile sexist beliefs about women and two types of benevolent sexist beliefs about women—PP and CGD—mediated the relationship between gender and RMA, such that men endorsed more sexist beliefs than women, and endorsement of sexist beliefs was positively associated with RMA (Angelone et al., 2021). The present study extended those ﬁndings by examining sexist beliefs about both women and men and by considering if sexual assault victimization history serially contributed to the relationship between gender and RMA. In the present study, there were signiﬁcant indirect effects of both hostile sexist beliefs toward women and heterosexual intimacy toward women in the relationship between gender and RMA. Importantly, sexual assault history partially accounted for these indi- rect effects. When sexist beliefs toward men were examined, the relationship between gender and RMA via these beliefs depended on whether sexual assault was also consid- ered in the indirect effect. Two types of benevolent sexist beliefs toward men—matern- alism and heterosexual intimacy—partially accounted for the relationship between gender and acceptance of rape myths when the role of sexual assault was considered. In contrast, hostile sexist beliefs, CGD, and heterosexual intimacy all partially accounted for the relationship between gender and RMA when sexual assault was not included in the indirect path. Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that sexual assault history plays an important role in the relationship between gender and RMA as do sexist beliefs about both men and women. This ﬁnding is important to consider given that most research on this topic has excluded sexual assault history (Heath et al., 2013) and has focused on sexist beliefs about women (e.g., Angelone et al., 2021). Gender Differences in Prevalence of Sexual Assault Consistent with previous research (e.g., Smith et al., 2018), women were signiﬁcantly more likely to experience a sexual assault since the age of 14 than men, as 39.9% of women and 9.5% of men reported a history of sexual assault in this study. However, it is important to note that both men and women in this study endorsed sexual assault victimization at concerning rates, which is consistent with previous research on college students (e.g., Krebs et al., 2007; Muehlenhard et al., 2017). Sexual Assault History and Sexist Beliefs Individuals who experienced a sexual assault reported lower levels of hostile and all three types of benevolent sexist beliefs toward women (i.e., PP, CGD, and heterosexual intimacy) and all three types of benevolent sexist beliefs toward men (i.e., maternalism, CGD, and heterosexual intimacy) than individuals who had not experienced a sexual assault. Conversely, hostile sexist beliefs about men did not differ by survivor status. Generally, these ﬁndings indicate that experiencing a sexual assault inﬂuences how individuals view power and gender roles. Additionally, these results should be 3046 Violence Against Women 30(11) interpreted within the context of prior literature demonstrating that most assaults are perpetrated by men (U.S. Department of Justice, 2014). Hostile sexism toward women focuses on justifying men’s dominance over others (Glick & Fiske, 1996). It is not surprising that individuals who have experienced a sexual assault would reject ideas involving domination by men, as sexual assault involves one person exerting power over another. As a result, survivors of sexual assault may be more likely to identify men’s everyday control over others as problem- atic. In general, benevolent sexism toward women involves subjecting women, in par- ticular, to passive roles (Glick & Fiske, 1996). Therefore, individuals who have experienced a sexual assault may not hold these beliefs as strongly, as sexual assault may involve the perpetrator viewing the victim’s resistance as “token” rather than as a lack of consent (Angelone et al., 2021). PP expresses that men should treat others as fathers would treat their children, with an emphasis on “affection and protection” (Glick & Fiske, 1996, p. 493). Survivors of sexual assault may be less likely to view men as protectors, particularly if they were assaulted by a man. Survivors of sexual assault may also be more likely to reject ideas of CGD because experiencing a sexual assault may change how survivors view traditionally feminine and masculine traits (Glick & Fiske, 1996). Finally, the concept of heterosexual intimacy suggests that men pursue women sexually to feel close to them (Glick & Fiske, 1996). Survivors of sexual assault may endorse lower levels of these beliefs because experiencing sexual assault may lead survivors to question stereotyped societal beliefs about romantic and sexual relationships. Similar to the ﬁndings about sexist beliefs toward women, individuals who experi- enced a sexual assault reported lower levels of all three types of benevolent sexist beliefs toward men (i.e., maternalism, CGD, and heterosexual intimacy) than individ- uals who had not experienced a sexual assault. Benevolent sexism toward men involves beliefs that men should be admired and women should take care of men (Glick & Fiske, 1999). It is possible that survivors of sexual assault are less likely to endorse beliefs that men need women to care for them (i.e., maternalism; Glick & Fiske, 1999) due to beliefs that they have been betrayed by men if a man perpetrated their sexual assault. CGD beliefs focus on the idea that men are more willing and able to protect others (Glick & Fiske, 1999), which is a belief that may have been violated for survivors of sexual assault. Finally, heterosexual intimacy beliefs toward men focus on the idea that a man needs to be loved by a woman to be complete (Glick & Fiske, 1999). For survivors of sexual assault, men may be viewed as not deserving of this type of relationship. In contrast to the ﬁndings about hostile sexism toward women, sexual assault history was not related to hostile sexism toward men in the path model. While this ﬁnding was initially surprising, as hostile sexism toward men focuses on rejecting men’s domination of and aggression toward others, the relationship between gender and hostile sexism toward men was quite strong when not considering the role of sexual assault history (i.e., women endorsed higher hostile sexist beliefs toward men than men did). As a result, it appears that sexual assault history is not related to hostile sexist beliefs toward men, but rather that women hold these beliefs more strongly than men regardless of their sexual assault history. This ﬁnding is consistent Wilson and Newins 3047 with research by Glick et al. (2004) which found that women reported higher levels of hostile sexism toward men than men. Sexist Beliefs and RMA Regarding the relationship between sexist beliefs and RMA, hostile sexism toward women, heterosexual intimacy toward women, and all three types of benevolent sexist beliefs toward men (i.e., maternalism, CGD, and heterosexual intimacy) were positively associated with acceptance of rape myths, and hostile sexist beliefs about men were negatively associated with RMA. Regarding hostile sexism toward women, the current ﬁndings replicated research by Angelone et al. (2021) and Chapleau et al. (2007) which found that hostile sexism toward women was positively associated with acceptance of rape myths. Because hostile sexism toward women involves beliefs that men should dominate others (Glick & Fiske, 1996), it would be expected that individuals who hold high levels of these beliefs would likely excuse per- petrators of sexual assault, which is a form of rape myth (Burt, 1980). The path model results for benevolent sexism toward both women and hostile sexism toward men are not consistent with previous research (Angelone et al., 2021; Chapleau et al., 2007). However, it is important to note that in bivariate correlations for the present study, all types of sexism were positively associated with RMA, which is consistent with Angelone et al. (2021) and Chapleau et al. (2007). As a result, it is likely that differences in the model outcomes between studies are due to differences in how models were run. Speciﬁcally, in the present study, two separate path models were run—one to examine the role of sexist beliefs about women and another to examine the role of sexist beliefs about men. In contrast, Angelone et al. (2021) only examined sexist beliefs toward women and ran separate models for all four types of sexist beliefs. Chapleau et al. (2007) ran one regression model examining the effects of all types of sexist beliefs about men and women, as well as the moderating effect of gender on each of these effects, in a single analysis. Therefore, it appears that all types of sexist beliefs are positively correlated with RMA, but the impact of speciﬁc types of benevolent sexist beliefs depends on the inclu- sion of other variables in the models. Furthermore, all types of benevolent sexism toward men were also positively associated with RMA in previous research, except that the relation- ship between maternalism and RMA was only signiﬁcant for women in Chapleau et al. (2007). These beliefs may increase RMA because they suggest men should be taken care of (Glick & Fiske, 1999), which could conﬂict with beliefs that the survivor should be believed when they accuse men of rape. Furthermore, beliefs that men are willing to put themselves in danger (i.e., CGD) and that men are looking to women to provide them with love to help them feel complete (i.e., heterosexual intimacy; Glick & Fiske, 1999) would likely be associated with ideas that minimize the seriousness of rape. Gender and RMA Although sexual assault victimization history does play a role in the relationship between gender and endorsement of rape myths, there were also signiﬁcant indirect 3048 Violence Against Women 30(11) effects of gender on RMA via hostile sexism toward women, heterosexual intimacy toward women, hostile sexism toward men, CGD toward men, and heterosexual inti- macy toward men. The ﬁnding regarding hostile sexism toward women replicates pre- vious research (Angelone et al., 2021). While Angelone et al. (2021) found that PP and CGD, and not heterosexual intimacy, mediated the relationship between gender and RMA, the differences in ﬁndings are most likely due to including all four types of sexist beliefs about women in a single model in the current study, as Angelone et al. (2021) examined each type of belief separately. As a result, when all types of sexist beliefs toward women are examined together, hostile sexism and heterosexual intimacy benevolent sexism appear to be the primary factors impacting RMA. Hostile sexism encompasses viewing women as sexual objects and emphasizes the power held by men (Glick & Fiske, 1996), which directly contribute to victim-blaming and the min- imization of the seriousness of sexual assault. Given that heterosexual intimacy con- sists of beliefs that men seek sexual intercourse from women as a way to form a psychological connection (Glick & Fiske, 1996), this may contribute to myths that men do not intend to perpetrate rape. The ﬁndings regarding sexist beliefs about men extend Angelone et al. (2021) results by suggesting that the effect of sexist beliefs on RMA is not limited to beliefs about women. Importantly, although the indirect effects via hostile sexism toward men and women were both negative, the mechanism by which hostile sexism accounts for lower RMA among women compared to men differs by whether hostile sexism toward women or men is examined. Speciﬁcally, women endorsed lower levels of hostile sexism toward women than men, and hostile sexism toward women was posi- tively associated with RMA. In contrast, women endorsed higher levels of hostile sexism toward men than men, and hostile sexism toward men was negatively associated with RMA. Additionally, the indirect effects of gender on RMA via both CGD and het- erosexual intimacy forms of benevolent sexism toward men were signiﬁcant. Women had lower scores on both of these benevolent sexism subscales, which is consistent with expectations (Glick & Fiske, 1999), and both of these types of sexism were posi- tively associated with RMA. Gender still had a signiﬁcant direct effect on RMA even after accounting for victim- ization history and sexist beliefs. Speciﬁcally, women endorsed more rejection of rape myths than men. This ﬁnding is consistent with a large literature base (e.g., Suarez & Gadalla, 2010).The present study further conﬁrmed the importance of examining the contribution of gender on endorsement of rape myths and indicated that future research should examine additional factors that may account for this relationship. Practice Implications These ﬁndings have important implications for programs geared toward preventing sexual assault on college campuses and improving support offered to survivors. As articulated by Angelone et al. (2021), “understanding the underlying mechanisms that inﬂuence RMA can assist with properly informing successful sexual assault pre- vention programs” (p. 10). Prior literature has focused on the higher levels of RMA Wilson and Newins 3049 observed among men rather than considering the mechanisms that may contribute to this trend (Suarez & Gadalla, 2010). People of all genders endorse believing rape myths. While a substantial number of college students endorse a history of sexual assault (e.g., Krebs et al., 2007; Muehlenhard et al., 2017), the majority of college stu- dents, regardless of gender, have not experienced a sexual assault. Since sexual assault history partially accounts for gender differences in RMA, programming on college campuses needs to ensure that content targeting RMA is applicable to people of all genders. Therefore, targeting the antecedents of RMA, such as sexist beliefs, may help to improve interventions. Given that sexual assault history was generally associated with sexist beliefs, which in turn were associated with RMA, clinicians may want to assess for broader sexist beliefs in addition to speciﬁc rape myths when conducting cognitive therapies with sur- vivors of sexual assault. Although experiencing a sexual assault was associated with a reduction in sexist beliefs, it is possible that survivors may experience overaccommo- dation by which the alterations to their cognitions become extreme. For example, rather than adjusting the belief that “Women are not complete without a romantic relationship with a man” to “My life will be complete with or without a male romantic partner,” a heterosexual female survivor may believe “I will never date again because I cannot trust men.” This belief could be associated with an increase in psychopathology. Therefore, given that both sexual assault history and sexist beliefs contribute to RMA, clinicians who work with sexual assault survivors should assess for and consider the impact of sexist beliefs. Limitations and Future Research Directions Although this study provides an important extension of previous research, there are several limitations that should be kept in mind when interpreting the ﬁndings. First, because the data collection occurred at a single time point, longitudinal research is needed to conﬁrm the direction of the relationships. Second, although a substantial number of participants identiﬁed their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latinx, there was limited racial diversity in the sample. Additionally, the vast majority of participants iden- tiﬁed as heterosexual. Related, the present study focused on participants who identiﬁed as male and female, excluding participants of other gender identities (e.g., non-binary, agender). Overall, it is unclear how these results would generalize to participants of other genders, or a wider range of sexual orientations, races, and/or ethnicities. Third, the U-IRMAS focuses on sexual victimization involving a male perpetrator and female survivor. Therefore, attitudes and beliefs about perpetrators or survivors of other genders were not captured in this study. Fourth, we only assessed for sexual assault history that had occurred since the age of 14 and therefore did not consider how earlier sexual victimization may have impacted the relationships examined here. We also did not consider how type of sexual victimization may have contributed to the participants’ sexism or RMA. Fifth, the ASI and ATMI are over 20 years old and research should be dedicated to considering whether the psychometric properties of those measures are still sound, particularly given several of the Cronbach’salphasin 3050 Violence Against Women 30(11) the present study were low. Sixth, although the study was conducted anonymously online, there is still the possibility that participants were impacted by social desirability or bias and did not truthfully report their levels of sexism or RMA. Finally, the study sample was recruited entirely from an undergraduate subject pool in the psychology pool. While students of many majors take participate in the subject pool, the results may not generalize to individuals not attending college. Conclusion Despite these limitations, this study is an important replication and extension of the study by Angelone et al. (2021). The ﬁndings demonstrated that men endorsed higher levels of RMA than women, and sexual assault victimization history and various types of sexist beliefs about men and women partially accounted for this rela- tionship. However, these variables did not fully account for the relationship between gender and RMA, indicating that scholars should expand their investigations to con- sider the inﬂuence of additional antecedents to rape myths. Furthermore, these ﬁndings can be used to inform sexual assault programming on college campuses and to improve services offered to sexual assault survivors.
