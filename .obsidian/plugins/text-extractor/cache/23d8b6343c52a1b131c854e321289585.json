Aymer Silberman School of Social Work, Hunter College, City University of New York, New York, New York, USA ABSTRACT It is impossible for individuals to survive without the ability to breathe. Eric Garner, an unarmed Black man, uttered “I can’t breathe” during an arrest by the police, who placed him a chokehold and caused his death (Goldstein & Schweber, 2014). Seeing this inhuman image on videotape pierced the consciousness of the nation. The grand jury failed to indict the police officer who killed Mr. Garner, and this sparked civil protests, which birthed the notion “Black Lives Matter” (Owens, 2015). Protestors chanted “I can’t breathe” to decry this injustice. This underscored literally and metaphori- cally how difficult it is for Black men to thrive in a hostile environment where their civil rights are denied. This article addresses the killings of unarmed Black men by the police, arguing that such killings are motivated by factors including how race, racism, and gender contribute to the “other- ing” of their humanity. Ideas from Critical Race Theory, the nexus among policing, criminality and racial profiling, critical consciousness, relational theory, and narrative therapy will provide a foundation for understanding the racialized experiences of Black men in America—where multiple forms of injustices exist—and where police killings are viewed as lawful. Highlighting practice themes from a case vignette involving an adolescent Black male engaged in psychotherapy will explicate how racial profiling by the police triggered race-based traumatic stress. The vignette will illuminate the implications for psychotherapeutic work with Black men who have been affected by race-based traumatic stress stemming from “living while Black.” KEYWORDS Black men; police; racial profiling As a historical fact, violence against Black people in the context of American history occurred during enslavement, Jim Crow, and the civil rights movement. Men, women, and children endured physical, psychological, sexual, and emotional terror during these periods (Leary, 2005; Petersen & Ward, 2015). The discourse of racial oppression in America cannot be disentangled from White supremacy, a worldview proclaiming White racial superiority and Black inferiority (Alexander, 2010; hooks, 1995; Madhubuti, 1990). The work of hooks (1995) delineates that White supremacy is a global system of domination affecting Black people in America and throughout the diaspora. Regarding such a claim, Alexander (2010) posits that “[f]aith in the idea that people of the African race were bestial, that whites were inherently superior, and that slavery was, in fact, for Blacks’ own good, served to alleviate the white conscience and reconcile the tension between slavery and the democratic ideals espoused by whites in the so-called New World” (p. 26). Because the premise of White supremacy was largely built upon faith and a negative belief system about Black people’s humanity, Alexander declares that its legacy and ideology have persisted far beyond its historical relevancy vis- à-vis American life. In addition, Critical Race Theory (CRT is a paradigm that has its roots in the legal profession and has gained traction in other disciplines) provides a foundation for understanding that violence CONTACT Samuel R. Aymer saymer@hunter.cuny.edu Silberman School of Social Work, Hunter College, City University of New York, 2180 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA. © 2016 Taylor & Francis JOURNAL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT 2016, VOL. 26, NOS. 3–4, 367–376 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2015.1132828 against Black people stems from a larger narrative, explicating that any evaluation of contemporary racism and/or racial oppression must take into account the influences that White supremacy has had on the American psyche (Crenshaw, Gotanda, Peller, & Thomas, 1995). Crenshaw et al. go on to suggest that an important facet of CRT is that race and racial oppression (historically or contem- porary) cannot be divorced from the ethos of White supremacy, which permeates all aspects of human institutions (e.g., social, legal, health, political, and cultural entities) aimed at promoting the welfare of our society. And the penetration of White supremacy throughout such institutions has prevented Black people from realizing full equal rights as citizens under the law. West (1993 summarizes this point by noting that “Black people have always been in America’s wilderness in search of a promised land” (p. 25). An important inference from West’s observation is that Black people have always fought to gain justice and protection through persistent nonviolent protests intended to effect social change and disrupt White supremacy. Opposition to civil rights activities has historically resulted in state-sanctioned violence (e.g., hosing down Black people with water, setting dogs on them, firing strategic or random shots at them, and homicides) by law enforcement (Leary, 2015). The presence of militarized police to control protesters (triggered by the killing of Michael Brown) in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 evokes painful memories of watching television footage of protests in the 1960s. The nexus between historical and contemporary practices of state- sanctioned violence against Black people can be examined though the following six CRT domains: (1) CRT recognizes that racism is endemic to American life; (2) CRT expresses skepticism about the dominant legal claims of neutrality, objectivity, color blindness, and meritocracy; (3) CRT challenges ahistorism and insists on a contextual historical analysis of the law; (4) CRT insists on the recognizing of the experiential knowledge of people of color and our communities of origin in analyzing law and society; (5) CRT is interdisciplinary and eclectic; and (6) CRT works toward the end of eliminating racial oppression as part of the broader goal of eliminating oppression in general (Lawrence, Matusda, Delgado, & Crenshaw, 1993, p. 6). Aspects of these domains can provide a backdrop for exploring how race and gender (with respect to Black men) are understood and examined through the lenses of institutionalized sociopolitical structures in American society. The killing of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Akai Gurley, Kajieme Powell, John Crawford, Amadou Diallo, and other unarmed Black men by police between 1999 and 2015 is a arguably akin to lynching, a racialized form of terror authorized by the law that occurred during the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Petersen & Ward, 2015). Gratuitous violence and deaths from lynching in America were omnipresent; the practice induced terror in Black men and ended their lives. The literature indicates that lynching and brutality perpetuated social control over Black people, specifically men (Johnson, 1982; Leary, 2015; Petersen & Ward, 2015). Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy who allegedly flirted with a White women and was brutalized and killed by a mob of White males, is one example of how violence was used to ensure that Black men did not move beyond their social location relative to Whites—particularly in encounters involving White women that could be construed as sexual or intimate. As the killing and dehumanization of Emmett Till was considered to be the norm during the era of lynching, his killers were acquitted (Baker, 2006). Lynching ruptured family ties as Black men had to flee for their lives (Johnson, 1982). Researchers suggest that lynching was conceptualized as a spectator sport by parents and children, who watched while Black male bodies (and women) were tortured and killed (Tolnay & Beck, 1995). A fundamental question that can be raised regarding this form of racial violence against Black men is: What was the role of law enforcement and the government in 1955 when Emmett Till was murdered? Evoking Emmett Till and the practice of lynching does not imply that policing in the 21st century is akin to White supremacist activities. The point, however, is that ongoing fatalities and violence due to how unarmed Black men are policed in America are palpable and elicit historical memories of how the practice of lynching affected Black men (Alexander, 2010,hooks, 1995;Leary, 2015; Petersen & Ward, 2015). An important premise of CRT is that historical antecedents provide context for how we analyze the effects of contemporary racial oppression on multiple levels within our society. Police killings and violence appear to be a consistent and persistent inescapable truth for Black men: Such killings and 368 S. R. AYMER violence are unwarranted; such killings appear to be lawful; dead Black men bodies are left on street corners in American cities (similar to how Black bodies were left hanging on trees during the era of lynching) for hours after they are shot by the police (Von Drehle, 2015); law enforcement tactics led to shooting a Black man in the back as he attempted to flee (Von Drehle, 2015), and finally police tactics caused significant injuries to the spinal cord of a Black man who died in police custody (Owens, 2015). These acts of police violence and killing are emblematic of why Black (male) lives may not matter, and they seem to evoke echoes of lynching, especially, because accountability of such types of unlawful police practices is lacking. The racialized experiences of Black men To be male and Black in America means that one must contend with omnipresent occurrences of racial and gender profiling on multiple levels (e.g., being arrested while Black, shopping while Black, driving while Black) of society. According to Ramirez, McDevitt, and Ferrell (2000), “racial profiling is defined as any police-initiated action that relies on race, ethnicity, or national origin rather than behavior of an individual or information that leads the police to a particular individual who has been identified as being, or having, engaged in criminal activity” (p. 3). This summary brings into focus what it means to “live while Black and male”—how racial profiling by the police in America undercuts the quality of life and physical well-being of this group. Racial profiling works against the interests of Black men, and we know from the “Person in Environment” paradigm that it is important for people to feel there is a “goodness of fit” between themselves and the environment, an important hallmark of social work (Germain & Gitterman, 1995). Moreover, Spencer, Fegley, Harpalani, and Seaton’s(2004) research stresses that maturation and growth are impeded when the social environment fails to nurture and value the needs of the individual. Black men are disproportionately profiled in society, and this cultivates an indelible stain of marginalization, causing others to devalue their dignity. According to the criminology literature, racial profiling is predicated on the following: the labeling perspective, conflict theory, and the colonial model (Gabbidon, 2003). The labeling per- spective is an outgrowth of a longstanding belief system that Black people are criminals, despite the lack of empirical data to substantiate such a claim. Captured in literature as “Blackaphobia” (Gabbidon, 1994, p. 347), the notion speaks to several factors, including stereotypic assumptions that an entire group is inclined to commit crimes. The labeling perspective can generate a sense of alienation and construct a narrative of “othering” with regard to Black men, whose subjective experiences with the police are fraught with distrust and anxiety. Rich and Gray’s(2005) findings reveal that the policing of Black men was viewed by participants as harassing and often stemmed from racial profiling. The labeling perspective can also be understood in the context of CRT discourse in that racism is inextricably linked to the myriad ways in which race, racism, and racial oppression complicate the lives of Black people in America. Although labeling affects both Black men and women, pronounced suspiciousness and scrutiny pervading police officers’ encounters with Black men raise the question of why these men are always perceived as potential criminals who should be handled in inhumane ways. Conflict theory is based on an understanding of how dominant social groups advance their status and power to strengthen their benefits (Quinney, 1980). Although conflict is inevitable in human interactions and dynamics, conflict theory asserts that the power differential in human transactions is underlined by oppression, exploitation, and social control of others to sustain social order and uphold the rights of the privileged. Moreover, “conflict theory holds that law and the mechanisms of its enforcement are used by dominant groups in society to minimize threats to their interests posed by those whom they label as dangerous, especially minorities and the poor powerful group” (Petrocelli, Piquero, & Smith, 2003, p. 1). Societal negative projections of Black men (e.g., images of this group as thugs, thieves, criminals, uneducated) lay the foundation for why this group is JOURNAL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT 369 perceived as a menace to society; thus, conflict theory can be used to understand why profiling is used to combat criminality. Furthermore, driving while Black (DWB) and shopping while Black (SWB) are examples of profiling strategies aimed at Black men in their daily lives (Gabbidon, 2003; Lund & Kaufman, 2003). DWB means that Black men are routinely stopped and searched by police if they are driving an expensive car or if they happened to be in a neighborhood that is dissimilar from their own. Black men are also burdened by SWB, predicated on the presumption of wrongdoing without probable cause when they visit stores to purchase goods and services. Such practices essentially place Blacks under siege. Portrocelli, Piquero, and Smith (2003) point out that “economic and racial minorities are seen as a threat to the ruling class. In regard to all of this, conflict theory maintains that the privileged, acting on the perception of threat, will use the crime control apparatus of the state to restrain and limit those who threaten their interests” (p. 2). Concomitantly, Alexander’s(2010) thesis on the New Jim Crow stresses that Whites invested in maintaining the social order, and this supported the war on drugs. And as a result, the war on drugs created another scheme for profiling the Black community and targeting Black men. Regardless of the type of profiling experienced by Black men, American society has always viewed this group as a threat. Alexander’s historical account of “death slavery” notes that Whites were afraid of violent uprising by Blacks; they constructed images signifying that Blacks were “menacing and dangerous” (p. 28). Alexander adds that “the current stereotypes of Black men as aggressive, unruly predators can be traced to this period, when Whites feared that an angry mass of Black men might rise up and attack and rape their women” (p. 28). Gabbidon (2003) indicates that the colonial paradigm can also be used to explain racial profiling in the policing of Black men. In citing Fanon (1963), who has advanced the notion of internalized colonialism, Gabbidon points out that such a worldview situates Black people in America as “other”—they are viewed as being “colonized in America” (p. 348). Black people’s existence is built upon the idea that they are colonized, and their entitlement to equal treatment under the law is often denied, a theme that emerges when the judicial system attempts to indict police officers for killing unarmed Black men (Alexander, 2010; Gabbidon, 2003). This view of Black people is embedded in institutional structures, notably the police, who utilize aggressive tactics to regulate their lives (Alexander, 2010; Portrocelli et al., 2003). It should be noted that the Black man’s inalienable rights were ignored when he was shot in his back in 2015. Such a use of brute force is consistent with leveraging control over those who have been deemed to have no legal and human rights. By definition, colonization means unequal power dynamics between those who are being colonized and their colonizers, so that controlling the movements and actions of Black men within in the context of DWB or SWB is another proactive strategy to reduce crime, protect property, and keep the privileged safe. Case vignette: Stop-and-frisk in the therapeutic space The case of Jamal is an exemplar of how a Black adolescent male was impacted by stop and frisk, which arguably is a precursor to police brutality and the killings of unarmed Black men. Jamal (a pseudonym) is a 16-year-old male who was referred to me, by his parents, for therapy as a result of his parent’s concerns about his education. Awaiting Jamal’s arrival to therapy was interrupted by a phone call from his father indicated that he could not attend the session; he had been stopped, frisked, and detained by the police. The tone and tenor of his father’s voice via our phone conversation meant he was worried about his son’s welfare. He alluded to feelings he held over the years concerning his son being stopped by the police. In expressing these concerns for his son, Jamal’s father revealed he had been stopped and frisked by the police several times while he was driving. Empathic listening from me seemed to be useful in enabling him to talk about his struggles as a Black man who, like many, could not protect his son from the same racial profiling he faced 370 S. R. AYMER (Coates, 2015; Franklin, 2004). As expected, his preoccupation centered on the safety of his son: he remained concerned about the police harming his son while he was detained. Jamal was on his way to therapy when the police stopped, frisked, and detained him. Although temporary, this derailed our work because Jamal refused to continue sessions; he was fearful he could be arrested again en route to my office. Staying in touch with his parents via phone kept me informed of how he was coping with his feelings of anger, agitation, and confusion. The manifesta- tion of these emotions caused Jamal’s parents to provide support to help him cope with the unjustified treatment he received from the police. After several brief phone contacts with Jamal, he agreed (five weeks after he was stopped and frisked by the police) to return to therapy. The psychosocial impact of stop-and-frisk Arriving 20 minutes before the session, Jamal seemed anxious, asking if we could start the session early. Acknowledging that he had been through a terrible situation with the police emphasized my concerns regarding his well-being. With a stoic and sad affect, Jamal nodded, “I was not doing anything, they just stopped me.” He further remarked that the police pushed him, opened his backpack, and arrested him for no reason. He was detained with other Black adolescent males who also had been stopped and frisked. Jamal discussed his inability to sleep at night and anxiety about additional encounters with the police during sessions. He spoke of leaving New York after completing high school, a possible indication of an avoidant coping response that may have been in the service of self-preservation. Subsequent therapy sessions focused on helping Jamal manage his feelings of being racially profiling by police officers and storeowners who profiled him as he entered retail outlets (SWB). He experienced SWB scrutiny when he was 15 years old while shopping in a department store in Manhattan. He did not share this incident with his parents or anyone else. Yet he readily spoke of the indignation he felt via therapy, using expletives to express his sense of powerlessness. Jamal mentioned unintended consequences such as death and brutality that could have occurred during his involvement with the police, demonstrating just how attuned he was to his precarious existence as a young Black male in America (Brunson & Miller, 2006; Carter, 2007; Coates, 2015). He also had trouble comprehending why he was stopped by the police when he was an A student who did not sag his pants and did not perceive himself as a “thug” or “thief.” Grief and sadness engulfed him, so I encouraged him to share all the facets of his emotions and explored questions of social injustices in his encounter with the police. Summary of assessment and psychotherapeutic processes Assessment Limited space permits only a summary of assessment issues and treatment processes. It appeared that Jamal’s reluctance to meet with me for therapy dissipated due to the psychological injury he felt from the aggressive and unjust police interactions (Carter, 2007). Meeting with Jamal for weekly psychotherapy facilitated a good working alliance. He developed increased comfort in exploring his feelings about two core areas: His desire to seek employment after high school and the emotional aftermath of being stopped, frisked, and detained by the police. In agreement with Jamal, I invited his parents to attend several sessions to support his growth as well as to mend ruptures associated with their disapproval of his decision to seek employment after high school. Jamal’s opposition to his parent’s wishes for him to attend college was understood through the prism of adolescent develop- ment (Blos, 1962; Erikson, 1963; McKenzie, 2008). The developmental epoch of adolescent reflects the need to repudiate and resist parental influences in order to grow and mature. Initial reactions from Jamal’s parents generated a sense of anxiety, inducing questions about identity, separation, and individuation from parents. Erikson (1963) posits that such reactions during adolescent are JOURNAL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT 371 normative and consistent with this phase of human maturation. Of equal importance is the impact of race and ethnicity on the psychosocial development of young Blacks and adolescents of color. These young people are categorized as minority and, according to Phinney (1996), “minority status is the presence of negative stereotypes” (p. 924). What is important here is that although Black male adolescents have to cope with life-course developmental challenges, they must also deal with the toxins from racial oppression in the social environment that ultimately impinge on their position- ality (Franklin, 2004). The pressing issue for Jamal, however, was his difficulties managing symptoms related to his negative interactions with the police. A psychiatric consultation revealed that Jamal was actually experiencing trauma (centering on being chased by the police), irritability, nightmares, flashbacks, and intrusive thoughts. Likewise, qualitative interviews of other young Black men profiled by the police reveal that anxiety, despair, and fear tend to surround their lived experiences (Brunson & Miller, 2006; Rich & Grey). Such feelings can be understood as traumatic reactions stemming from racial profiling and police abuse, which underscores Herman’s(1992) point that traumatic experi- ences trigger symptoms that are both physiological and psychological, and this weakens an indivi- dual’s capacity to function. And, indeed, Jamal’s traumatic symptoms (along with the aforementioned qualitative interviews of other young Black men) underlined the gravity of oppres- sion in terms of how it punctured his psychological state, echoing Carter’s(2007) statement that “the symptom manifestations of race-based traumatic stress include having reactions of intrusion (re- experiencing), avoidance (numbing) of stimuli associated with the trauma, and increased arousal or vigilance. In the case of racial discrimination, or racial harassment, the client’s subjective appraisal of the experience is valid” (p. 84). Central to Carter’s thesis is that exposure to racism and racial harassment trigger anguish, terror, torment, and physical pain. In Jamal’s case, the police manhandled him, causing physical pain to his right arm. In addition, Herman (1992) proposes that: Trauma events call into question basis human relationships. They breach the attachment of family, friendship, love, and community. They shatter the construction of the self that is formed and sustained in relation to others. They undermine the belief systems that give meaning to human experience. They violate the victim’s faith in a natural or divine order and cast the victim into a state of existential crisis. (p. 51) Ascertaining a psychiatric consultation coupled with my lived experiences as a Black man allowed me to understand Jamal’s traumatic reactions as a psychological sequelae of enduring aggressive and unfair police actions. According to writers and clinicians (Butts, 2002; Carter, 2007), there is no diagnostic categorization in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder explicating how racism and racist encounters damage the psychological health of Black people living in America. And Butts’s(2002) keen observation of this omission implies that, “even in those instances in which African-Americans are objects of discrimination and describe symptoms consistent with PTSD, their symptoms may be dismissed or trivialized because of the view that the stressors are not catastrophic enough, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM), to warrant a diagnosis PTSD” (p. 336). Seeking a psychiatric consultation from a culturally competent practi- tioner was precipitated by a change in Jamal’s behavior, an effect that was validated by his personal account of his feelings following his stop-and-frisk ordeal. Moreover, using my lived experiences as a Black man who has been profiled engendered empathy and support for Jamal. In addition, a tenet of CRT is that the lived experiences of Black people within the context of their communities should not be subjugated in analyzing race and racism; instead, such experiences should be used to evaluate social forces that undermine the human rights of Black lives (Lawrence et al., 1993). Psychotherapeutic processes Utilizing an integrative approach to treatment proved to be beneficial in an effort to improve Jamal’s psychosocial functioning. Aspects of narrative therapy, relational factors, and critical consciousness 372 S. R. AYMER development were employed in psychotherapeutic work with him. Narrative therapy suggests that all human beings possess a story that has multiple authors (Carr, 1998). Saying that our lives are storied and have multiple perspectives means that it is critical important to develop insights and meanings about who we are in relation to self, family, and the macrostructure of which we a part. This encapsulation of (Carr’s 1998)viewpoint holdstruefor Jamalon a multiplicity of levels. The basis of his troubles with law enforcement officers is rooted in biased attitudes that society has embraced about Black men. And of course Jamal had his own construction of himself, another narrative that intersects with the ones noted previously. As per Carr’s frame, I helped Jamal to “externalize the problem” (p. 491), so that he could comprehend that his injurious experience with the police was rooted in a much larger sociopolitical context. As an intervention, externalizing the problem helped Jamal dispel the idea that there was something inherently problematic about his persona that provoked violent police behaviors, a point he alluded to upon his return to therapy. In addition, Jamal was encouraged to give voice to his feelings and concerns to lessen his traumatic reactions. The therapeutic hope was for Jamal to be less symptomatic so that he could feel better about himself and reconnect to his friends and his community. Notwithstanding this setback, he demon- strated a strong determination to reclaim his autonomy; an indication of this was the comfort he regained that allowed him to return to therapy. In affirming Jamal’s emotions, my therapeutic expectation was to help him feel a sense of control over this facet of his life. Jamal’s narrative (as a dangerous young Black man) is authored by society. What it pointed to, as I noted in an earlier article (Aymer, 2013), is that “[s]hared vulnerability means that many African Americans have some level of psychological consciousness about the potential physical and psychic danger of living in a society that has a history of racial animus toward them” (p. 133). That Jamal had appropriated his good academic standing, his lack of interest in wearing sagging pants, and his view of himself as a nonthug or thief illustrated that he was acutely aware of how marginalized images of Black men lead to risks and vulnerability (Brunson & Miller, 2006). A critical consciousness and a cognitive and affective process helped Jamal grasp how internalized oppression affected him (Watts, Griffith, & Abdul-Adil, 1999). The aforementioned notion of labeling perspective (e.g., Blackaphobia) advanced by Gabbidon (2003) underscores that society’s stereotypic perceptions of Black people as criminals lead to negative internalization, and this could explain to some degree why the issue of “Black male respectability” was important to him. Unlike his contemporaries, he might escape the perni- cious effects of racial profiling. By using the lens of critical consciousness, psychoeducation was employed to shift his cognitive process away from believing he could lessen racism, oppression, and racial animus by simply modifying his physical appearance or believing his academic prowess would be transparent to others. Jamal’s emphasis on such a positioning was a precaution against racial harassment, a lesson he may have learned from his parents. The goal wastohelphimdevelopwhatDuBois(1953) refers to as “double consciousness”:the importance of recognizing how historical and contemporary racial oppression have shaped multiple self-states in Black people in America, as well as the quintessential emotional struggles to coexist in a society that devaluates this group. Helping Jamal loosen societal stereotypes of him as a young Black man fostered exploration of his subjective truths. Jamal used his cognitive and affective capacities to process how his feelings of marginality were influenced by larger institutional factors (as opposed to how he dressed or behaved), which underlined the saliency of using narrative processes to develop critical consciousness, which supports the observation by Watts et al. (1999)that “oppression is the principal target of critical oppression” (p. 287). Jamal felt empowered, and he reported that the process alleviated feelings of self-blame (e.g., questioning why he was profiled and believing he could have thwarted such an act by behaving in a particular fashion). Thomas, Davidson, and McAdoo (2008)notethat “[h]aving a critical awareness of racism is being cognizant of the dynamics and nuances of racist and unfair treatment” (p. 285). JOURNAL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT 373 Conclusion The aim of this article was to focus on unjust and aggressive policing culminating in killings and fatal injuries of unarmed Black men. In doing so, it was crucial to invoke and address historical state- sanctioned violence against and killings of Black people in America. Critical Race Theory has established that the liberation of Black people in America cannot occur without interrogating and analyzing how the horrific reality of enslavement, centuries of discrimination, and unequal treatment have affected this group. Critical discussions and analyses of racial oppression must be located in a historical context to understand the precursors to manifestations of contemporary social injustice. To this end, I argue that the current killings of unarmed Black men should be analyzed through the lens of how America has treated Black men throughout history, reflecting on the legacy of lynching when violence and killings were employed to control this group. I point out how this form of control is also illustrative of how society places Black men at the margins by constructing stereotypic images of them as dangerous and prone to criminality. That these menare perceivedassuspectsasopposed to citizens in the context of Driving While Black or Shopping While Black illuminates why a criminal justice policy such as random stop-frisk-search has infiltrated society’s notion of how law and order should be maintained, especially in the context of policing Black (male) bodies. The second part of the article discusses a case vignette involving a Black adolescent male who presented symptomatology due to his experience of being stopped, frisked, and detained by the police. Why is the presentation of this case relevant to the discourse about unjust policing in the 21st century? My observation has been that critical discussions about this social problem have focused primarily on reforming the police and criminal justice system. Unquestionably, it is logical to focus on these issues to effect systemic change. Yet it is equally useful to expose and attend to the psychological aftermath of police violence sustained by unarmed Black men (Rich & Grey, 2005). For instance, in Newtown, Connecticut (children living in this town were shot and killed by a mass murderer while they were at school), a horde of mental-health experts were brought in to work with surviving children and interviewed by the media, exposing the sequelae of individual and community trauma (pertaining to the mental health of children, their families, teachers, etc.) Unlike this type of media coverage, discussions of police killings of unarmed Black men are usually devoid of any exploration of how racial profiling, brutality, and racial harassment by police and other entities (SWB-store owners) causes traumatic reactions and possibly posttraumatic stressdisorderinthispopulation. Thus,itishoped that this case vignette provides a framework for increasing knowledge of how racial profiling by the police (particularly as it relates to aggressive and abusive policing of unarmed Black men) can mar an individual’s psychosocial functioning. Jamal’s case shows the potency of racial oppression, particularly as it obstructs the humanity and worth of Black men living in America. Furthermore, the case raises the following themes: (1) It is counterproductive to pathologize (i. e., perceiving this group as crazy) Black men who are attempting to cope with the psychological wounds of racial oppression; (2) it is helpful to understand their pain within the realm of the ubiquitous reality of marginality and its psychosocial consequences; and (3) it is beneficial for Black men to reauthor their narratives a self- development process that can counteract the daunting effects of internalized oppression and can lead to self-empowerment. Finally, psychotherapeutic work with Jamal was effective. His symptoms diminished con- siderably, The supportive and empathic space created in our work provided emotional safety for Jamal; he enhanced his adaptive coping, and this alleviated his anxiety, anger, and confu- sion about being profiled by the police. It was my professional assessment that although the police incident imprinted him, he worked through his feelings—and this enabled him to complete high school and follow through with his plan to leave New York City.
