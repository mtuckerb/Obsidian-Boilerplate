Proceedings for support as prerequisite. Before making demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this State with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the Governor may require a prosecutor of this State to demonstrate that, at least 60 days previously, the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the proceeding would be of no avail. [PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 (NEW); PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. E, §2 (AFF).] 2. Criminal charge in another state. If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter, the governor of another state makes a demand that the Governor surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the Governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective. If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the Governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding. [PL 2003, c. 436, §47 (AMD).] 3. Declination to honor demand. If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the Governor may decline to honor the demand. If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the Governor may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.
