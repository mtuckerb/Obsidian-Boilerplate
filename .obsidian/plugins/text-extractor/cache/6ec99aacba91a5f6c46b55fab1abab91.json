{"path":"2025/Summer/HIH-203 - Mind Body Stress Reduction/HIH-203 - Week 4/Attachments/HIH-203 - Week 4 - Reflective Journal.pdf","text":"This week I learned that self-compassion and self-pitty are not the same. I discovered that, through a process called neuroplasticity, what we practice becomes stronger. This means that we can harm ourselves through negative self talk, actually leading ourselves to act out these negative messages that we casually saddle ourselves with. The week's readings and videos have given me an opportunity to inspect the way that I speak to myself, and to become more generative in my internal feedback. Instead of saying, \"you're so bad at procrastinating,\" I have instead tried to embrace that I work best under time pressure, and therefore should enjoy the time that I do not have the focus that that pressure brings, by doing things that will prepare me to be at peak productivity when the deadline looms. I loved how Shauna Shapiro encouraged us to Slow down. She showed that when we have abundant space, safety and capacity, we are more likely to express our natural compassion. Shapiro also shared the parable of Indre's Net and encouraged us to picture ourselves as part of the whole when doing compassionate work. \"If the left hand has a splinter, the right hand will just take it out.\" It is not supposed to be self-congratulatory when you merely take care of the greater self. In his Positive Psychology paper, Joaqín Selva reminded me that the ancient practice of gratitude meditation is something that I can practice on a daily basis when I am, for example waiting for my morning coffee to brew (or in my case, while drinking my coffee). He asserts, and I have witnessed in my own practice, that this simple act of enumerating what I am grateful for can reduce depression, increase feelings of wellbeing, trust in strangers, and the quality of my sleep. It may seem like a funny takeaway, but one of my favorite quotes from this course came from the \"Deepening A Personal Meditation Practice\" list by John Kabat-Zinn; \"So a gentle love aﬀair with the present moment is important.\" I love how this calls on love, a feeling that we often associate with our most treasured things and people. It brings to mind and heart the preciousness of the present moment, and encourages me to really make the most of it when I can. This combined with the self-compassion that I mentioned at the outset, are the recipe that I intend to continue to work on after this course has ended. I set my intention to be kind to myself, to develop shame resiliency, to slow down and be present, even when that moment is uncomfortable, and to continue to practice daily self care through meditation, exercise, and diet.
