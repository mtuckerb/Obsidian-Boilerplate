The research fo- cuses on efforts to protect beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores. This study con- cludes that state CZM programs are effective overall in addressing the protection objective of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA). This conclusion recognizes that the CZMA requires states to balance competing needs and demands such as protection of natural resources from hazards and overdevelopment, promo- tion of recreational use, and respect for private property rights. Determination of CZM program effectiveness is based on process indicators and case examples. Out- come indicators were too sparse to allow an outcome effectiveness determination. All coastal states and territories use a wide variety of tools and processes to achieve resource protection, including regulatory, planning, state land management, acqui- sition, nonregulatory, and research tools. Regulatory tools are the most significant tools employed nationwide, because the majority of the oceanfront shoreline is in private ownership and is subject to significant shoreline change and development pressures. Over 60 significant upgrades to coastal management programs have been implemented over the years to protect natural shoreline resources. “Process indica- tors” of effectiveness show increased resource protection from CZM efforts. Of the 29 coastal states and territories studied, most (23) employ setbacks from the shore- line to provide a natural buffer between development and the water. All (27) but a few regulate shoreline activities to protect critical habitat and minimize adverse impacts on resources. All (28) but one regulate shoreline stabilizations to minimize adverse impacts on beach systems. Most (23) restrict pedestrian and vehicular ac- cess to channel human encroachment along boardwalks or dune crossovers, mini- mizing dune destabilization and impacts on fragile resources. All (28) but one use planning tools to designate and protect specific shoreline resources. Within state coastal parks, most (25) have designated natural protection areas and guided accessways. Many (21) have acquired additional coastal land holdings. Almost half use board- walks or dune crossovers to protect dune vegetation and minimize adverse impacts on natural resources, and sand fencing and dune creation to restore the natural function of damaged dune systems. Over half (17) use beach nourishment to recre- ate eroding recreational beaches. Greater attention is needed to document on-the- ground results of CZM resource protection efforts through in-depth case studies and long-term monitoring of resource indicators of program success.

Gordon This article looks at the tools used by state coastal zone management (CZM) programs to protect natural beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores and examines the effective- ness of these management tools in achieving national policy objectives. This study is one part of the five-part National CZM Effectiveness Study (CZME) reported on in the lead article of this issue of Coastal Management (Hershman et al., 1999). Both process outcome measures and on-the-ground outcome measures are used to assess CZM pro- gram effectiveness for this resource area. Recommendations for improving federal and state accounting of the results of coastal management programs can be found in Hershman et al. (1999). In the 1972 Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), Congress declared that na- tional policy includes: (A) the protection of natural resources, including . . . beaches, dunes, barrier islands, coral reefs, and fish and wildlife and their habitat, within the coastal zone. (B) the management of coastal development to minimize loss of life and property caused by improper development in flood-prone areas and in areas likely to be affected by or vulnerable to sea level rise, land subsidence, and saltwater intrusion, and by the destruction of natural protective features such as beaches, dunes, wetlands and barrier islands. (CZMA, 1972, Sec. 303) All coastal states (hereinafter, states refers to coastal states, Great Lakes states, and island jurisdictions) with federally approved coastal programs have adopted policies that interpret and implement the national policy objectives. These policies call for the protec- tion of natural resources and the minimization of loss of life and property along the coast through management that incorporates the protective capacity of natural features and systems. However, as these policies are implemented, conflicting trends and policies temper the ability to meet the goal of protecting natural resources. For example, the combina- tion of high coastal land values and legally protected private property rights results in extreme pressure to build close to shore and to protect from erosion the large inventory of coastal property already built. Similarly, the pressures for public access and recre- ational use of beach and dune areas place stress on natural systems, but recreation and access are themselves clearly articulated goals of CZM. Thus, most coastal program managers are forced to find a balance between protection of natural systems, access for recreation, and private property rights. This pressure for balance in the decision process confounds an effectiveness study since a negative outcome in one goal, such as maintaining a natural dune system, may be a positive outcome for another goal, such as recreational access. Despite difficulty in assessing competing goals, this study shows considerable accomplishments by coastal managers in advancing the protection goal set forth in the CZMA. For example, as outlined fully later, virtually every state uses some combination of up to 26 management tools for resource protection. Regulatory tools such as setbacks and development con- trols are the preferred management option. And, over 60 significant upgrades to coastal management programs have been implemented over the years to protect natural shore- line resources. The research conducted for this study documents how coastal states and federal agencies collect outcome data. It reveals that coastal and federal agencies are not rou- tinely collecting the types of outcome data that were identified as valuable in measuring State Effectiveness in Protecting Natural Shores 189 on-the-ground results in achieving national resource protection objectives. This article first presents the context for management, including the extent and importance of the resource and the impacts that threaten it. Next, process indicators of effectiveness, which states use in varying ways to shape their management approach, are set forth. Third, a discussion is presented of the upgrades to management tools adopted by the states which indicate greater sophistication and maturity in management. The fourth section identifies outcome indicators of effectiveness, including case examples that illustrate how data are collected to show on-the-ground results of CZM programs. The conclusion summarizes major findings. Background and Context Beach, Dune, Bluff, and Rocky Shore Resources Beach resources are present along portions of all coastal state shorelines, though the length and character of such beaches vary considerably. Sandy beaches can be catego- rized into three distinct types: barrier beaches, mainland beaches, and pocket beaches. The Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Coast are characterized by a system of barrier beaches and a relatively wide continental shelf, as is much of Alaska. Barrier beaches are part of a complex integrated system of beaches, marshes, bays, tidal flats, and inlets. These beaches are constantly migrating, eroding and building in response to natural processes and human activities. Mainland beaches stretch unbroken for many miles, some low standing and prone to flooding, others backed by steep headlands. They re- ceive sediment from nearby rivers and eroding bluffs. Examples include Long Island, northern New Jersey, and southern California. Pocket beaches form in small bays sur- rounded by rocky cliffs or headlands. The headlands protect the sandy alcoves from erosion by winter storms and strong currents. Pocket beaches are common in Maine and the Pacific Northwest. Headlands and rocky shorelines and bluffs and cliffs are present along the West Coast, the Northeast Coast, the Great Lakes Coast, and territorial shores. These features are absent along the low-elevation southern and South Atlantic coastlines. Eroding bluffs and cliffs of the Great Lakes states, which create beaches and dunes, are subject to high water levels. When driven by storm winds and waves, the result is flooding and lakefront deterioration. Table 1 provides data important to an understanding of beach resources and their management. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data, the length of the U.S. coastline includes two measures: direct oceanfront miles, which cross mouths of bays and sounds, and tidal shoreline miles, which extend inland to the head of tidewaters or to a point where tidal waters narrow to a width of 100 feet. The national shoreline, as measured by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1970, is also shown, along with their estimate of the percentage of shoreline critically eroding. Percentage of direct ocean coastline in beaches, rocky shores, and bluffs is also indi- cated from state CZM program estimates. For 8 of the 29 coastal states, ocean coastlines consist entirely of sandy beaches. All 21 other coastal states exhibit a range of coastal features: beaches and rocky shores, backed by bluffs or sand dunes. Table 1 also pre- sents population statistics for coastal states: percentage of the population residing in the coastal zone, population density in the coastal zone, and population change in the coastal zone. For example, in 16 of the 29 coastal states, population growth was 30% or greater; in five coastal states, population growth was between 10% and 29%; and for eight of the states, population growth was 0 to 9%.Table 1National context factors affecting the protection of beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shoresPopulationPopulationResourceStateStatedensity inchange inprotection:Open oceanTidalNational shorelinelandpopulation incoastal zonecoastal zoneIssuecoastlineashorelineb(miles) and (%)areacoastal zone(persons per1970–1990State/territoryimportancea(miles)(miles)critically erodingc(%)d(%)dsquare miles)d(%)eAlabamaHigh46g607352961217127AlaskaHigh6,64033,90447,300>16785189American SamoaHigh126126n/dn/d10010060772CaliforniaHigh8403,4271,8274247360539ConnecticutMedium0618270947628878DelawareHigh25g3812261210010033822FloridaHigh1,266g8,4266,266510010022890GuamHigh108g110n/d310010063757HawaiiHigh7501,052n/d210010017444LouisianaLow149g7,7211,9432374917116MaineHigh2283,4782,500>139727229MarylandHigh32g3,1901,9399667050712MassachusettsHigh1921,5191,2001145751,2725MichiganHigh03,224n/dn/d5550154–5MississippiHigh44g3592471541219230New HampshireHigh18g131405123233167New JerseyHigh125g1,7924692676901,2196New YorkHigh125g1,850638473784858–3North CarolinaHigh320g2,6253,6611519117539 190Northern MarianaIslandsfHigh184g206n/dn/d100100236255OregonHigh362g1,4105001320388246PennsylvaniaHigh0140n/dn/d4251,701–9Puerto RicoHigh311700n/dn/d1210085630Rhode IslandHigh4038434071001009506South CarolinaHigh181g2,8763,0632262411457Virgin IslandsHighn/d175n/dn/d10010077163VirginiaHigh200g3,31599326226242340WashingtonHigh1713,0262,337>1317017246WisconsinMedium0820n/dn/d19391770TotalsHigh: 2685,77031,513hMedium: 2Low: 1Note: n/d indicates no data.aFrom State CZM Profiles on Protecting Beaches, Dunes, Bluffs and Rocky Shores.

Bernd-Cohen and M. Gordon Balancing Competing Demands for Resource Protection and Development The natural resource protection values of beaches and dunes include protection of up- land properties from storms or high tides and maintenance of wildlife habitat for marine life such as sea turtle nesting areas, bird nesting and staging areas, and endangered species habitat. Key use values of beaches and dunes include recreation, tourism, and access to coastal waters. Additionally, lands adjacent to beaches are highly desirable places for second homes, resorts and year-round residences. The use of beach environments can adversely affect their natural values. Beachfront and blufffront development built too close to the water has led to shoreline armoring, which has destroyed the natural beach and dune systems that attracted people to the coast in the first place. In addition, cutting and maintaining inlets for recreational and commercial navigation have permanently disrupted the natural transport of sand along the beachfront, sometimes accelerating the loss of recreational beaches. Coastal bluffs, sitting behind extensive or minimal beaches, have been thought of as excellent features for providing coastline vistas. In a few states, select bluff areas have been acquired and managed as natural resource protection areas or scenic vista areas. Most are managed as high-erosion areas, where development and other activities are regulated to minimize erosion risks rather than to protect valuable natural resource fea- tures. The social and economic pressures for ocean vista developments have resulted in the siting of development along bluff recession areas in harm’s way. Rocky shores, located within the intertidal zone, are recognized as high-energy en- vironments and valuable marine habitat. The intertidal areas are normally under state ownership and management. Although public access and recreational enjoyment of these areas have not been restricted, states are beginning to limit public access to avoid over- utilization and destruction of tide pool areas. Rocky shoreland areas have for the most part been resistant to erosion and therefore not managed as high hazard areas. Likewise, they have not been considered developable, though development often occurs immedi- ately landward of these features. Complicating this picture are a host of human interferences which have adversely affected the natural sand transport system, destroyed dunes or caused dune instability, and increased erosion. These interferences include: dammed coastal rivers; dredged navi- gational channels with jetties for shipping and dredged tidal inlets for commercial fishing and recreational boating; the placement of dredged spoil and beach-quality sand offshore beyond the littoral sand transfer system; shoreline armoring; sand-trapping struc- tures such as groins and breakwaters; sand mining for development; and sand-scraping practices. Occasionally these human interferences are positive. Efforts to recreate natural beach and dune systems include sand fencing and dune revegetation, beach nourishment, and inlet sand transfer (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [USACE], 1971; Platt, 1992). Balancing such competing demands has become a key role of state CZM programs. As our understanding of the impact (both individual and cumulative) of human activities on natural systems grows, coastal managers are looking for alternative management ap- proaches to allow activities while minimizing their negative impacts on resources of known public benefit. Institutional Complexities Adding to this management challenge are two formidable institutional complexities. The first is a mixed public and private ownership pattern along the coast, and the second is the overlapping responsibilities of many agencies, of which CZM is only one. State Effectiveness in Protecting Natural Shores 193 Public and private interests share ownership of the beach. State ownership of beaches usually begins at mean high water and extends seaward. This leaves extensive dry sandy beach and dune systems in private ownership, except where governments have reserved or acquired beachfronts for military, recreational, or preservation purposes. For the 20 coastal states (not including the islands or the Great Lakes states), public ownership ranges from a high of 99% for Alaska to a low of 3% for Maine. For 11 of the 20 states, over one-quarter of the shoreline is publicly owned (USACE, 1971). This means that approximately 70% of our nation’s coastline is privately owned. Because such a large percentage of the nation’s coastline is privately owned, protecting private property rights in the regulation of coastal land and water uses is of paramount importance in the development and implementation of coastal management tools. The CZM programs of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management and those of the coastal states are not alone in the man- agement of beach resources. Other federal agencies have a long history of involvement with our nation’s coastlines, all predating CZMA. USACE issues permits for dredge and fill in all navigable waters, including permits for shoreline armoring; authorizes naviga- tion channel dredging; and funds federal shore protection studies and projects address- ing beach nourishment and shoreline armoring. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers the Federal Flood Insurance Program that insures struc- tures along the coast in coastal hazard (V-zone) areas. The role of CZM has been to focus attention on ways to minimize adverse impacts on natural resources and has in- cluded working with federal agencies whose missions, such as armoring to protect struc- tures along eroding coastlines and insuring structures in coastal hazard areas, conflict with natural systems protection objectives. Process Indicators of Effectiveness Coastal states currently utilize 26 tools and processes to protect beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores, including planning, state land management, acquisition, and nonregula- tory and research tools. A list of tools used to protect beaches and dunes can be found in Table 2. Tools used to protect bluffs and rocky shores, as well as indicators of effec- tiveness in protecting these resources are described in “State Coastal Management Effectiveness in Protecting Beaches, Dunes, Bluffs, Rocky Shores: A National Over- view” (Bernd-Cohen & Gordon, 1998). Ten process indicators of effectiveness were chosen from this tool set: six regulatory tools, one planning tool (representing the com- bination of the three original planning tools), and three state land management tools (representing a combination of the five original state land management and acquisition tools). These indicators are defined below. 1. Coastal setbacks for development and redevelopment from beaches, dunes, bluffs, or rocky shores. The farther inland the setback, the more effective; the fewer exceptions allowed within the setback, the more effective. (A regulatory pro- gram) 2. Coastal construction control areas along the shoreline with regulations govern- ing activities affecting beaches, dunes, steep slope bluffs, erodable bluffs, and rocky shores and limits on size, type, design, or location of permitted construc- tion to minimize adverse impacts on beach, dune, and bluff systems; controls over new significant activities with few exceptions; controls over additions, re- pairs, and rebuilding. The more restrictive, the more effective. (A regulatory program) 194 T. Bernd-Cohen and M. Gordon 3. Shoreline stabilization regulations, which place limitations on the use of shore- line stabilization structures in favor of nonstructural solutions. (A regulatory program) 4. Access restrictions, with requirements for boardwalks or dune crossovers to mini- mize adverse impacts on dunes, and designated areas where pedestrian and/or vehicular access is restricted to protect resources. (A regulatory program) 5. Habitat protection and other controls over critical habitat areas where uses are restricted to protect habitat protection values. (A regulatory program) 6. Permit tracking and enforcement provisions which are used to monitor permits and violations. (A regulatory program) 7. Adopted plans for areas containing enforceable policies that address resource protection, beach nourishment, inlet management, dunes restoration, or special area resource protection or conservation. The larger the resource area covered, the more of the shoreline included, and the more restrictive the enforceable policies, the more effective. (A planning program) 8. State coastal land holdings, including inventory of the number, acres and shore- line miles of state lands in state oceanfront parks and preserves. (State coastal land management and acquisition programs) 9. State coastal land management and stewardship, including park management plans; boardwalks, dune crossovers, or other guided pedestrian access; dune restoration and beach nourishment where appropriate; enforceable policies restricting the use of shoreline stabilization structures; and designated natural resource habitat pro- tection areas. (State coastal land management and acquisition programs) 10. State coastal land acquisition program with coastal land acquisition as a prior- ity. (State coastal land management and acquisition programs) These tools were selected because they showed the greatest potential in terms of their usefulness in evaluating on-the-ground outcomes. Nonregulatory and research tools were not examined as process indicators because these types of tools are primarily used to support the four other management categories, namely, regulatory, planning, state land management, and coastal acquisition. Regulatory tools are the most significant tools employed nationwide to protect shore- line resources, because the majority of the oceanfront shoreline is in private ownership and is subject to significant shoreline change and development pressures. The scope, policies, and provisions of state coastal regulatory programs afford greater natural re- source protection, if successfully implemented, than before these programs were in place. State coastal programs protect beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores through set- backs, regulation of shoreline development and shoreline stabilizations, restrictions on pedestrian and vehicular access, habitat protection, and permit compliance/permit track- ing systems. Twenty-three coastal states employ construction setbacks from the shore- line to provide a natural buffer between development and the water. Twenty-seven coastal states regulate activities within defined coastal construction control areas in ways that minimize adverse impacts on the natural shoreline resources and protect critical habitat areas. All but one of the coastal states (Alaska) regulate the use of shoreline stabilization structures to minimize adverse impacts on beach systems. Only a few coastal states, however, prohibit shoreline stabilization structures. These states place protection of beach systems as a policy priority over protection of upland structures. Twenty-three coastal states restrict pedestrian and vehicular access along portions of the shoreline. Pedestrian access restrictions channel human encroachment along boardwalks or dune crossovers, minimizing dune destabilization and limiting adverse impacts on fragile shoreline State Effectiveness in Protecting Natural Shores 195 resources. Vehicular access restrictions keep vehicles off sensitive coastal habitat areas or limit vehicular use to government vehicles or off-road vehicles in areas planned for their use. Twenty-five coastal states have permit compliance programs to enforce their regulations and permit tracking systems. Planning tools, when combined with regulatory tools, are used to protect natural resources. All but one of the 29 coastal states (Delaware) use planning tools to protect beach, dune, bluff, or rocky shore resources. These planning tools include: (a) local coastal planning (voluntary or mandatory), some of which is combined with local permit delegation; (b) special area management planning; and (c) resource-specific planning. The planning programs are more effective when combined with implementation through state regulation or local land use regulations, zoning, and subdivision ordinances and other local permit delegation. Twenty-one coastal states use local permit delegation. In nine coastal states (Alaska, California, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington) locally delegated permitting combined with mandatory local planning provides a key to effectively managing and protecting beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shore resources. Planning tools are discussed in more detail below. Stewardship of coastal lands, through direct land management and acquisition, is an important component of all state coastal programs. All coastal states own state parks along the shoreline that encompass one or more beach, dune, bluff, or rocky shore. Most coastal states have natural protection areas and guided accessways and many have acquired additional coastal land holdings. Almost half of the coastal states use board- walks or dune crossovers to protect dune vegetation and minimize adverse impacts on natural resources, and employ sand fencing and dune creation to restore the natural function of damaged dune systems. Over half of the coastal states use beach nour- ishment to recreate recreational beaches which are eroding. Eleven coastal states have chosen to armor or repair existing shoreline stabilization structures in high erosion areas, primarily to protect coastal highways or other public infrastructure investments. Nonregulatory and research tools are used by all coastal states and support regula- tory, planning, acquisition, and direct land management activities. For example, educa- tion and technical assistance to local governments function to improve local coastal planning and regulation. Likewise, research and technical reports on shoreline erosion rates function to improve state regulatory controls over development in erosion-prone areas. Table 2 identifies the key nonregulatory and research tools that states use in shoreline management. No attempt was made to collect outcome data for these tools, because it was beyond the scope of this study. Coastal Setbacks Coastal setback regulations are selected for more detailed discussion to illustrate the elaborate programs developed for protection of our natural shoreline resources. The rationale for selecting coastal setbacks as a key indicator tool is that such regulatory provisions provide a clear signal to landowners that the area seaward of the setback is off limits to certain development and, therefore, a resource protection area. In addition, setback provisions lend themselves to cross-states comparisons of landward setback dis- tances, activities excluded from setback requirements, and other key factors. As shown in Appendix A, 22 of the 29 coastal states have adopted land use regula- tions in the form of setback requirements for new structures that can be built on the shoreline. Another two states use locally created setbacks.Table 2State CZM tools used for the protection of beaches and dunesaToolsRegulatory & planning 29Restrict construction xbxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 27Setbacksxxxxxxxxxx*xxxxxx*xxxxxxx 23Control areasxxxxxxxxxxxxxx*xxxxxx*xxxxxxx 27Restrict shoreline stabilizationsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 28Restrict pedestrian/vehicular accessxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 23Protect habitat, other restrictionsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 25Permit compliance programxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 28Local plan and/or regulatexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 22Special area management plansxxxxxxxxxxxx 12Other adopted plansxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 16Direct land management, restoration and acquisition 29Shoreline in state parksmanagementxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 29Natural areas protectedxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 25Dues revegetatedxxxxxxxxxxxxx 13Beaches nourished or renourishedxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 17Shoreline armoring and repairsxxxxxxxxxxx 11Coastal lands acquiredxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 21 196 Alabama Alaska American Samoa California Connecticut Delaware Florida Guam Hawaii Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Mississippib New Hampshire New Jersey New York North Carolina CNMIc Oregon Pennsylvaniad Puerto Rico Rhode Island South Carolina U.S. Virgin Islands Virginia Washington Wisconsin TotalNonregulatory 29Public investment restrictionsxxxxxxxxxxxxx 13Public investment incentivesxxxxx 5Coastal property disclosurexxxxxx 6Education/outreach/technical assist.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 28Financial assistancexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 20Research 29(Methodologies for shore)xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 19Beach profilesxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 23Natural areas inventoryxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 27Technical reportsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 29Aerial photosxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 29Sea level rise considerationsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 25Total tools employed (25)1513122221192417191621132018152018202114201116162313201518Notes: x indicates that the management tool is employed by the state.aCZM tools used to protect bluffs and rocky shores are contained in Bernd-Cohen and Gordon (1998).bIn Mississippi, all beaches are artificial and open to the public.

Gordon Setback laws have a dual purpose: (1) to protect the natural beach and dune or bluff systems as storm buffers; and (2) to reduce the loss of life and property from hurricanes and other storm events. Implementation of these laws has reduced the number and size of new structures that can be built on the shoreline and has located those structures that are built as far landward from the water’s edge as possible to prevent erosion from reaching the structures during their expected useful life. Ten of the 22 states measure their setback lines based on an arbitrary distance in- land from the shoreline; four measure setbacks by using erosion rate data (Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia); three measure setbacks according to distinct resource features (New York, Oregon, South Carolina); and five measure setbacks by using a combination of arbitrary distance, erosion rates, and features (Maine, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Virgin Islands). Because setback lines are measured differently and be- cause each state has unique resources and geographical features, it is not practical to attempt to determine the extent of landward setback boundaries nor is it practical to determine which states have the most landward setback boundaries. For example, states vary in the shoreline location inland from which they measure their setbacks (mean high water, mean low tide, normal high water, crest of dune, elevation, or contour line). The landward boundary also varies. Sixteen of the 22 state setback laws contain provisions for exceptions that tend to weaken the effectiveness of the setback requirements. Examples include single-family dwellings seaward of the setback if the land was platted before the effective date of the statute, or small parcels where there is not enough land to build behind the setback line. In some states, exception provisions have been added to state laws to avoid private property taking claims such as allowing construction behind the crest of the foredunes, where restricting private property rights is more difficult. Other types of exceptions in- clude in-filling in developed areas, water-dependent uses, public interest activities, rec- reational activities, swimming pools, fences, and boardwalks. Below are two case examples that illustrate the most sophisticated and information- based methods for setting development back from the shoreline. North Carolina’s ocean- front setback law is the strongest in the nation, with a graduated system for setting development back from the eroding coastline based on the size of the development. Pennsylvania’s bluff recession and setback act steps development back from the eroding bluff based on the type of development activity proposed and offers technical assistance to property owners. North Carolina’s Oceanfront Setback Law. This strong law uses erosion rates to deter- mine setbacks and keep development out of ocean hazard areas. Within the “Ocean Hazard Areas of Environmental Concern”—sand dunes, ocean beaches, and other areas exhibiting substantial possibility of excessive erosion—setbacks are based on average annual erosion rates, natural site features, and the nature of the proposed development. The setback is measured from the first line of stable natural vegetation or from aerial photos and ground survey where there is no stable vegetation. New structures smaller than 5,000 square feet and fewer than five residential units must be set back the farthest landward of the following: (1) a distance equal to 30 times the long-term annual erosion rate; (2) the crest of the primary dune; (3) the landward toe of the frontal dune; or (4) 60 feet landward of the vegetation line. The law requires that larger structures be set back 60 times the average annual erosion rate, or 120 feet landward of the vegetation line. Where erosion rates exceed 3.5 feet per year, the setback line for larger structures is 30 times the erosion rate plus 105 feet. This law was passed in 1974, made part of the State Effectiveness in Protecting Natural Shores 199 coastal program in 1978, and amended in 1981 to make additional allowances for single- family residences. The coastal program supports studies of erosion rates used in deter- mining setbacks (North Carolina State Statute 113A and Coastal Area Management Act, Areas of Critical Concern Administrative Guidelines). The Pennsylvania Bluff Recession and Setback Act. This act provides a long-term regu- latory approach to reducing property losses from bluff recession along Lake Erie. The act requires municipalities in bluff recession hazard areas to administer bluff setback ordinances that restrict new development from bluff areas and limit improvements to existing structures within the minimum bluff setback. Setback distance is based on the rate of erosion (feet per year) multiplied by the life span of the structure and is a mini- mum of at least 50 feet from the crest of the bluff. The life span for residential develop- ment is 50 years, for commercial is 75 years, and for industrial is 100 years. The major effect of this program has been to keep new development a safe distance from bluff recession hazard areas. CZM provides technical assistance to Lake Erie property owners affected by bluff recession; this assistance consists of on-site inspections and recom- mendations for surface and groundwater control, bluff stabilization, and the role of vegetation to stabilize loose soil conditions. In the first seven years of the service (1981– 1988), approximately 75% of the surveyed property owners followed CZM’s recom- mendations, resulting in an estimated property damage savings and property value en- hancement of $5.2 million. Pennsylvania is the only Great Lakes state to offer this service (S. Malone, phone interview and correspondence, September–October, 1996). CZM Planning We have selected planning tools for more detailed discussion because planning data collected, in combination with regulatory enforcement of plans, aptly illustrate the re- source-specific management that has been achieved in various coastal locations. As indi- cated earlier, all but one of the 29 coastal states (Delaware) use planning tools to protect beach, dune, bluff, or rocky shore resources. The types of planning tools can be grouped as follows: · local coastal planning (voluntary or mandatory), some of which occurs in combi- nation with local permit delegation; · special area management planning (defined below); and · resource-specific planning such as management plans for beaches, inlets, bluffs, rocky shores, natural reserves, habitat conservation areas, and erosion or hazard areas. The planning tools used by coastal states (shown in Table 3) can be summarized as follows: · 18 coastal states use local coastal planning; · 23 coastal states utilize special area management plans (SAMPs) or other resource- specific planning; and · several coastal states use more than one planning tool. Local Coastal Plans. Local coastal planning includes the plans adopted by local coastal communities that address an array of land use and resource protection issues.

Ten states do not utilize local planning tools to achieve shoreline resource protection. Coastal planning programs are only effective when combined with implementation measures such as state regulation or local land use regulations. Twenty-one coastal states use local permit delegation, with or without planning. Locally delegated permitting re- sponsibility combined with mandatory local planning are key coastal management tools employed by eight coastal states: Alaska, California, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington. It should be noted that certain regulatory setbacks and control zone provisions de- scribed earlier are administered by local governments based on state guidelines. Local implementation in these cases is not based on adopted plans, but rather on state regula- tory mandates. For example, the Pennsylvania Bluff Recession and Setback Act requires local setback ordinances. No local planning is required. Other states such as California and Oregon mandate both local plans and zoning ordinances to implement state coastal goals and guidelines. California’s approach is described below. The California Coastal Program requires that the California Coastal Commission (CCC) oversee and certify local coastal programs (LCPs). LCP regulations require each local coastal program to identify and address specific issues including coastal resources, hazard areas, coastal access, use priorities, and significant cumulative impacts of devel- opment on coastal resources and access. LCPs are also required to adopt a land use plan, zoning ordinances, and zoning district maps to reflect the level and pattern of development consistent with policies in Chapter 3 of the California Coastal Act. The land use plans must incorporate resource protection policies. Zoning ordinances are re- quired to implement land use policy plans. CCC Certification of a LCP results in del- egation of coastal development permit authority (State of California, 1995). As part of their LCP, the City of Malibu adopted District Interpretive Guidelines covering environmentally sensitive habitat areas and natural landform. Blufftop develop- ment must be set back 10 feet and property owners who insist on building in known hazard areas must sign a natural hazards waiver for public liability (State of California, 1981). Special Area Management Plans (SAMPs). These are geographic-specific plans that ad- dress multiuse management issues such as recreational access, resource protection, and development. The plan covers a defined geographic area that warrants special manage- ment attention, usually where natural resources are in jeopardy. Twelve coastal states use SAMPs. These plans supplement or supersede state coastal regulatory provisions for selected planning areas. Rhode Island and Guam coastal programs have been active users of special area management planning. The Guam Recreational Water Use Plan, a type of SAMP, is summarized below. The Guam Coastal Management Program developed and adopted the Recreational Water Use Management Plan in 1990/1991. The plan addresses user conflicts over a 6-mile stretch along the coast and in the water; bird nesting areas are identified and protected, as are Manahac fish-runs. The plan provides for “use zones” for certain water activities in planned areas, and requires buoyed areas for personal watercraft (jet skis) and mechanized vehicular closure during predictable Manahac runs. Minimum operating age is 16 years for all mechanized water vehicles. Jet skis can only be operated in planned areas; two such areas have been adopted, and a third area is being finalized. The first area planned, Agana Bay to Piti, encompasses 6 linear miles of coast to a distance seaward varying from State Effectiveness in Protecting Natural Shores 203204 T. Bernd-Cohen and M. Gordon 200 yards to half a mile. The second area, Cocos Lagoon, is a triangular lagoon 3 miles long on the land side, extending 2 miles seaward. The third area is Apra Harbor, which is Guam’s commercial port, the Navy port, and Guam’s Harbor of Refuge (M. Ham, phone interview and personal correspondence, August–September, 1996). Resource-Specific Plans. Sixteen coastal states have adopted resource-specific plans. These plans cover resources such as beaches, dunes, inlets, rocky shores, and habitat conserva- tion areas. They address a range of issues: natural resource protection, erosion control, flood hazard management, recreational use conflicts, economic development, and multi- use conflicts. Some resource plans, such as the Oregon rocky shore plan described below, are state-level plans covering all shoreline resources. Other plans are more local or issue-specific, typified by the beach management plans summarized below. Oregon’s Territorial Sea Management Plan of 1994 includes a rocky shore strategy and serves as a model for other states with rocky shore resources. The plan covers rocky shores, intertidal areas, and ocean resources in an ecosystem management process. The plan provides an ocean policy framework with management standards to be used in managing the marine resources in Oregon’s territorial seas. Under the strategy, four classifications of rocky shores are designated to guide agency programs on the ground. They include: ten “habitat refuges” along 4% of the rocky shore where access is limited; seven “research reserves” along 7% of the rocky shore where access is discouraged and harvest is limited; eight “marine gardens” along 10% of the rocky shore which encour- age visitors to highly popular areas; and 29 “marine shores” along 79% of the rocky shore which are small areas open to the public but not heavily used. In addition, nine areas have been identified but not yet designated and seven priority offshore rocks/reefs identified for future study. A key aspect is “local site management plans” for rocky shore sites with mandatory policies to address complex site conditions, biological resources, human uses, and agency management concerns. The strategy provides clear policies for all agencies to follow and a process for intergovernmental coordination. Education and public awareness through communications and interpretive programs are crucial parts of the strategy to manage growing usage and impacts on rocky shore areas. On-the-ground results of site management plans indicate that four marine gardens have been closed to the taking of marine invertebrates, clams (except razor clams at Cape Perpetua), and mussels (except single mussels for bait). Under the plan, Pyramid Rock in Rogue Reef, a critical habitat site for Steller sea lions, is closed within 1,000 feet to all fishing activity from May to August. Permit or management conditions have been placed on all rocky shore sites to protect the natural resource values of these areas (B. Bailey, phone interview and correspondence, August–September, 1996). Beach Management Plans. Beach Management Plans are an important component of some state CZM programs. States’ concerns include the adverse effects on downdrift beaches from federal dredging of navigation channels, offshore disposal of dredged ma- terials, and loss of recreational beaches from shoreline armoring. This has led state CZM programs to take a proactive role in shaping state and federal policies and programs. For example, the Florida coastal program funded studies of beach and inlet erosion prob- lems and solutions, which led to state legislation requiring that suitable beach-quality sand from inlet and navigational channel dredging be placed on the downdrift beaches. The state coastal program then used federal consistency and state funds to negotiate with the USACE to place 1.4 million cubic yards of sand from St. Mary’s inlet dredging State Effectiveness in Protecting Natural Shores 205 on the downdrift beaches rather than losing the sand to the offshore system (Bernd- Cohen, 1988). Some states have passed legislation limiting the use of new shoreline stabilizations in an effort to protect beach and dune systems. For example, the South Carolina Coastal Council (SCCC) funded numerous planning studies on beach conditions and issues leading to enactment of the 1988 Beachfront Management Act and the 1990 Amendments estab- lishing an erosion retreat program which requires setback lines based on expected beach erosion over 40 years. To build public awareness and education about the beachfront coastal erosion problems, the SCCC produced Who Owns the Beach?, a 90-minute film on beach and hazard management issues which was aired in 1989. The SCCC has used mass media to communicate and respond to heightened public awareness of SCCC events such as the Lucas v. SCCC property takings case that received national press coverage as it made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court (Lucas v. SCCC, 112 S.Ct. 2886 (1992)). It will be decades before the retreat policy established in the 1988 legislation corrects the problem of historic shoreline armoring. In the short run, repeated, expensive attempts at beach renourishment will be required to rebuild public beaches (C. Brooks, phone inter- view and correspondence, August–September, 1996). Upgrading CZM Processes CZM is a growing and changing process meeting changing needs. As state CZM pro- grams recognize problems or management gaps, they take corrective action. All but two (Maryland and Wisconsin) coastal states have made significant changes in their pro- grams to the way they protect beach, dune, bluff, and rocky shore resources. When looking from the time of original state program approval to the present— more than 20 years—coastal states have made numerous changes and refinements to their programs. Some changes involved program amendments; others were just routine program improvements. Over 60 significant changes have been made by state coastal programs solely to protect natural shoreline resources (Bernd-Cohen & Gordon, 1998). Most of these program changes involved alteration of the state CZM regulatory and planning tools. Significant changes have commonly included expansion of the geographic area or types of activities covered by shoreline setbacks or regulations and changes to limitations on shoreline stabilizations. Most states are giving greater consideration to natural shoreline processes, even when addressing other concerns such as the need to protect developed eroding shoreline using structural measures. Examples of significant program changes made by 13 coastal states to their CZM tools are provided in Table 4. These examples were chosen to illustrate regulatory program changes made around the nation to improve protection of beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores. With few exceptions, these program changes occurred in the late 1980s and the 1990s after the programs had been in place for several years. All of the program changes identified in Table 4 were the result of program issue identification, research, and public education. Outcome Indicators of Effectiveness Outcome indicators are used to measure the on-the-ground effects that result from imple- mentation of CZM tools. Outcome indicators of CZM effectiveness in implementing regulatory, planning, and direct land management and acquisition tools associated with the protection of beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores are shown in Appendix B. 206 T. Bernd-Cohen and M. Gordon Table 4 Significant changes in tools used by State CZM programs affecting the protection of beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores California Adopted coastal hazard landform alteration policy guidance in 1993 to address geologic stability of blufftop development. Connecticut Amended its regulatory program in 1987 to include permits for seawalls which had previously been exempt from review. Florida Amended its beachfront regulatory program in 1985 to estab- lish a 30-year erosion zone and prohibit major development seaward of that zone line. Hawaii Amended its setback provisions in 1989 to limit variances and improve enforcement of setbacks and variances. Maine Amended its sand dune rule in 1989 and 1993 to broaden and clarify permit requirements for development on sand dunes. In 1995, Maine amended its Natural Resource Protection Act to allow existing seawalls and other shoreline stabilization to be fortified and built bigger/stronger to protect existing threatened oceanfront development. This was contrary to the sand dune rule that promotes retreat from erosion-prone areas. Massachusetts Passed a State Endangered Species Act in 1990, which expanded beach management from flood control and storm damage protection to include protection of wildlife habitat and endangered species. Michigan Amended its Shorelands Protection and Management Act in 1992 to expand the definition of bluffline to cover non- bluff shoreline and extended the inland setback requirements to address severe short-term erosion events. New Hampshire Revised the definition of the high water mark in 1995, extending more landward state permit jurisdication. New Jersey Amended its oceanfront permits program in 1988 and 1990 to expand its jurisdiction landward and include single-family and commercial development and shoreline stabilization previously excluded. Amendments also created erosion hazard areas and erosion-rate setbacks within these areas. North Carolina Amended its program in 1985 to prohibit hard erosion control devices designed to harden or stabilize beaches, and modified its law in 1989 to allow stabilization to protect historic structures. Oregon Adopted a Territorial Sea Plan in 1994 which includes a Rocky Shores Strategy. Areas are inventoried, classified, and designated under one of four classifications; within these areas, access/use is restricted. South Carolina Amended its Beach Management Act in 1988 and 1990. Since 1988, the state has prohibited new shoreline stabilization structures; since 1990, reconstruction of shoreline stabiliza- tion and rebuilding of certain damaged structures has been restricted. U.S. Virgin Islands Adopted 18 Areas of Particular Concern in 1994 which include sea turtle nesting beaches for special protection.

State Effectiveness in Protecting Natural Shores 207 The outcome indicator categories mirror the key tools states employ in resource management: (1) regulatory; (2) planning; and (3) land management and acquisition. Indicators of desired outcomes for each category and outcome survey methods are de- fined as follows: Regulatory Programs: · No further or reduced rate of encroachment into coastal resource areas; · No further or reduced rate of hardening of the undeveloped shoreline; · Controlled shoreline accessways; · Healthy and maintained intact natural habitat areas along the coast. Adopted Plans: · Achievement of plan objectives. Coastal Land Management and Acquisition · Presence of state coastal land holdings containing coastal resources; · Active public natural resources stewardship of coastal land holdings. Outcome Survey Methods · Survey methods for measuring outcomes start with a baseline, followed by peri- odic updates and evaluations. · Standard survey methods include aerial photography interpretation, permit data trend analysis, periodic physical surveys, mapping, and documentation of acres, linear shoreline miles, and areas under government supervision. The outcome indicators listed in Appendix B were selected for this study because some states and federal agencies are actually using such indicators in specific geographic areas to measure program activities and outcomes. For example, most state coastal pro- grams are developing and refining computerized permit-tracking systems and are inter- ested in using these systems to assess cumulative impacts. These indicators were also selected because the survey technology and methods are already established (i.e., aerial photography, computerized permit tracking, and physical surveys). However, there are costs involved in collecting and replicating this data nationwide and conducting surveys on a periodic basis. Other issues are data comparability between states, utility of data in measuring program outcomes, and attribution of outcomes to CZM programs and/or other agency programs. An example of regulatory outcome indicator data is linear data and/or area data on permits issued, which reflect the desired outcome of either few or no permits for activi- ties seaward of a setback line or within identified natural resource areas. On the other hand, miles of beachfront shoreline developed or armored through permitting is a counter- indicator of the desired outcome: beach protection. With this and other kinds of data, such as aerial photos, changes in development patterns along our nation’s coastline and in specific natural coastal resource areas can be documented. If baseline and time series data existed, an attempt to trace the rate of reduced impact or reduced rate of encroach- ment into fragile coastal areas could be achieved. If these changes are then linked in part or whole to CZM regulatory controls, then the CZM program can show credible outcome results from their work. Even if that linkage cannot be made, the information is still useful for indicating the state of the resource. Examples of the limited outcome data that are available are presented next. 208 T. Bernd-Cohen and M. Gordon Regulatory Outcomes Coastal states restrict the size, location, and design of structures and shoreline stabilizations to minimize adverse impacts on natural beach and dune systems. These restrictions are often noted as conditions attached to individual permits. None of the 25 states that employ restrictions over activities such as sand mining and beach nourishment routinely collect data on the results of these restrictions. Additionally, while 20 of the 29 coastal states examined have computerized permit-tracking systems (19 for habitable structures and 20 for shoreline stabilizations), none of the coastal programs keep statewide data- bases on coastal statistics or resources affected by the permits approved for activities along the shoreline. Such information, when available, is contained in individual permit files. Of states that delegate coastal permitting to local governments, no state maintains a multiyear database on local permits. Sixteen states provided permit data, but that in- formation was insufficient to show outcomes. It should be noted, however, that states like California and Washington have conducted studies on the rate of erosion and extent of shoreline hardening in specific counties. These studies, if done coastwide, could pro- vide a baseline of conditions for determining the results of management actions. Twenty-three states restrict pedestrian and/or vehicular access in order to protect natural beach resources such as dune grass and turtle nesting areas. Several coastal states issue permits for boardwalks and dune crossovers or set guidelines for their construc- tion. However, quantitative data are thin. For example, only one state provided data on pedestrian access permits and just three states provided data on vehicular access permits. Michigan data show 200 to 250 public access projects approved between 1989 and 1995 and vehicular access restrictions along 23% of the coastline. New Jersey data show two permits for boardwalks between 1994 and 1996 but no data on local-level restrictions of vehicular access. Oregon data show 12 boardwalks permitted between 1967 and 1995 and vehicular restriction along 70% of the coastline. South Carolina allows, without permit, small walkways over dunes if guidelines are met. Larger projects require a per- mit. Data show that 12 large boardwalk permits and 13 emergency vehicular access permits were issued by South Carolina between 1988 and 1995. Although the informa- tion from these four states is helpful, it is insufficient to show trends for the particular states or to suggest conclusions nationally. Twenty-seven states protect areas such as endangered species habitat by restricting activities and development in these areas. Nine states provided data on protection areas. For example, Michigan has been particularly active showing 300 miles of critical dunes, 250 miles of natural preserves, and 310 miles of high-risk erosion areas. Alabama data show 3 miles of sea turtle nesting; 40 acres of beach mouse habitat; and 25 acres of tern nesting habitat. New York reports 50 miles of beachfront bird nesting sites and 200 designated fish/wildlife habitat areas. And the Virgin Islands data indicate that there are 13 recreational beaches, 9 sea turtle nesting beaches, and 13 protected barrier island areas. This type of data is a good start, but if additional information on type and condi- tion of habitat and management responsibilities were added, then the usefulness for CZM evaluation would be enhanced. Rhode Island illustrates the extent of management activ- ity, but also shows the need for improved outcome monitoring. The Rhode Island Coastal Program. This program regulates defined coastal features. The Coastal Resource Management Council (CRMC) regulates activities within and 200 feet landward of defined coastal features (coastal beaches and dunes, barrier beaches, bluffs, cliffs and banks, rocky shores, and manmade shoreline). Complex coastal zoning State Effectiveness in Protecting Natural Shores 209 designates what types of activities are permissible on shoreline features, tied to six state water classifications. About 75% of the shoreline is adjacent to Type 1 Waters (Conser- vation) or Type 2 Waters (Low Intensity Use Areas) where alteration or construction of shoreline features and undeveloped barrier beaches is prohibited. In addition, activities are regulated by different setbacks from beaches and dunes, critical erosion areas, and coastal buffer zones. There are also regulations for specific types of activities (such as dredging, filling, and new residential structures) as well as 17 designated coastal hazard areas and 18 identified erosion-prone areas. On the dunes of barrier beaches, residential or non-water-dependent structures destroyed by more than 50% may not be rebuilt re- gardless of insurance carrier coverage. Additions are allowed only to structures desig- nated for priority permissible uses. CRMC policies prohibit new development on unde- veloped and moderately developed barrier beaches, and data show that at least 65% of all barrier beaches have had no new permitted development or shoreline stabilizations since 1971 (J. Willis, phone interview and correspondence, September–October, 1996; State of Rhode Island, 1990). The Rhode Island Coastal Resource Management Program (CRMP) has had a com- puterized coastal permit-tracking system in place since 1987. This system was upgraded, and paper permit files dating back to 1971 are now in the computer system. The CRMP tracks permit data by activity type but not by location such as beach, bluff, or rocky shore. The CRMP is considering changing their system so it is able to identify the extent of permitted activity by resource area. Adopted Plan Outcomes As noted above, three types of planning tools are used to protect beaches, dunes, and other shorefront resources: local coastal plans, SAMPs, and resource plans. Outcome data for each are limited. Most coastal states that utilize local coastal planning maintain information on the number of local plans the state has approved. The next steps needed are for coastal states to collect data on the content and implementation success of these local plans. Information is needed on natural resource protection areas, local setbacks, land use des- ignations, changes to land use or zoning, and other relevant data to assess shoreline resource protection through local planning. By way of example, 35 of the 41 coastal towns and boroughs in Connecticut have adopted municipal coastal programs consistent with Connecticut Coastal Management Act policies and use guidelines. They contain long-range land use plans for coastal development and conservation, and include imple- menting local zoning and subdivision regulations. Most have established setbacks from sensitive coastal resources and the high tide line. Through Municipal Coastal Site Plan Review, municipalities regulate development between mean high water and the coastal inland boundary. Since the Connecticut coastal program relies heavily on local planning, a state database on local setbacks and implementation would strengthen the program’s ability to document program success. Of the 13 coastal states with adopted SAMPs, Guam and California provided out- come data. Results of the Guam SAMP, Recreational Water Use Management Plan, are presented above, in the “Process Indicators” section of this article. Information on the California SAMP for the Malibu/Santa Monica mountain area is provided now. The California Malibu/Santa Monica Mountain Transfer of Development Credit Pro- gram. In 1979, Coastal Conservancy and CCC developed a Transfer of Development 210 T. Bernd-Cohen and M. Gordon Credit (TDC) program requiring, as a permit condition, that proposed subdividers or builders of multifamily housing units extinguish or retire the development potential of comparable existing undeveloped parcels prior to the creation of new parcels or addi- tional units in density. The purpose was to eliminate small undeveloped and poorly sited parcels that, if built, would increase erosion, runoff, and landslides. The area covers both shoreline bluffs and inland bluff areas that are part of the coastal zone, but not located along the beachfront. By 1989, over 700 parcels of land were placed under open space easements or offered to dedicate open space easements in the Santa Monica Mountain area (State of California, 1992). Three of the 17 states with adopted resource plans provided outcome data: Pennsyl- vania, Florida, and Oregon. Data from Pennsylvania indicate eight approved local plans under the Bluff Recession and Setback Act, with setbacks covering 50 miles, or 94% of bluff-front. Florida data show 500 miles of beach under state erosion plans, with 100 miles of beaches restored. The Oregon Rocky Shore Plan data are shown in the “Process Indicators” section of this article. Other coastal states with resource plans provided data on the number of plans and areas covered. For example, New York data show that two erosion management plans were approved covering 25 miles, or 20% of their beaches. For the states with adopted SAMP or resource-specific plans, the following types of surveys and outcome measures can assist with assessment of program effectiveness: (1) aerial photo interpretation of on-the-ground changes since plan adoption; (2) periodic physical surveys of areas protected or managed under enforceable plans; and (3) state and local permit data on activities allowed within approved plan areas, area and linear miles affected by approved permits, and consistency of permitted activities with plan objectives. State Coastal Land Management and Acquisition Outcomes All 29 coastal states own state parks along the shoreline that encompass one or more beach, dune, bluff or rocky shore. In all states, coastal parks managed by the state park agencies are part of the states’ approved CZM program. In addition, CZM programs provide funds or other assistance to state park agencies to encourage stewardship of state coastal lands to balance resource protection and recreational uses. Seventeen state park agencies have inventory data on their state coastal land holdings such as number of shoreline miles in state parks or percentage of shoreline in public ownership. And all but five states have information on the total number of beach miles and number of state coastal parks. About two-thirds of the state park officials know the number of beachfront coastal parks they own; over half keep information on the miles of state coastal park lands. Several states are active stewards of their public coastal land holdings. The types of data which would be helpful in tracking state stewardship and the state of the coast include: (1) number of accessways, marked trails, boardwalks, and dune crossovers; (2) dune restoration projects measured in acres, miles of shoreline involved, state funds; (3) beaches restored or renourished as measured in cubic yards, beachfront miles, state funds; (4) number of shoreline stabilizations installed with acres and shoreline miles affected as a counterindication to stewardship; and (5) acres and/or shoreline miles in state coastal lands designated as conservation, preservation, or protection areas and aerial photo in- terpretation or periodic physical surveys to verify condition of resources. Of the 26 coastal states which have designated natural resource protection areas, all have some limited data on the number of areas protected, the types of species protected, State Effectiveness in Protecting Natural Shores 211 the types of resource areas protected, and/or the number of acres protected. For ex- ample, the New Jersey coastal protection areas data show a 1,200-acre wildlife sanctu- ary, 1,000 acres in beach nature areas, a 100-acre bird sanctuary, and three other nature areas covering 1,201 acres. Oregon’s data on restricting public access show that vehicles are prohibited along 70% of the coastline. It would be helpful if states collected data on the value or condition of the habitat protected and the results of the protection activities in order to assess program effectiveness. Of the 21 coastal states that are utilizing acquisition to purchase additional valuable coastal resources, 15 states provided some data on the number of properties and acres acquired. Most are coastwide or statewide acquisition data. For states with multiple coastline resources, data are not broken down by beaches, bluffs, or rocky shores. Very few states provided data on amount of money spent. There is a need for data that differentiates between acquisition of coastal lands and the state’s overall land acquisition program. If sufficient funds were available, most states would be in a position to incorporate such data in their information systems. Massachusetts illustrates the scope of coastal park ownership and stewardship and the need for better information collection. The Massachusetts CZM Program. This program collects data on coastal parks and steward- ship of public beach resources. Twenty-five percent of the Massachusetts coastline is in public ownership, 5% of which is in state ownership. There are 18 coastal parks covering 63 linear miles (335,064 feet). Five coastal park management plans have been completed covering 4,673 acres, and 5 coastal park beach plans are in progress covering 5,000 acres. There has been one federal/state-sponsored beach nourishment project covering 2 to 3 miles, and dunes have been restored. The Rivers and Harbors Program funds dune resto- ration, beach restoration, and armoring projects. The state has 14 designated Areas of Critical Environmental Concern covering 75,000 acres. Outcome indicator data show that 2,250 acres were acquired by state agencies. A better understanding of program effectiveness would be possible if more data were compiled on pedestrian access restric- tions; dune restoration, beach nourishment, shoreline armoring projects funded, and re- sults; and the types of resource areas protected under the Area of Critical Environmental Concern program (D. Buckley, phone interview and correspondence, Fall, 1996). Conclusion · State CZM programs are effective overall in addressing the objective of the CZMA to protect beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores. This conclusion recognizes that the CZMA requires states to balance competing needs and demands, such as protection of natural resources from hazards and overdevelopment, promotion of recreational use, and respect for private property rights. Determination of CZM program effectiveness has been based on process indicators and case examples; outcome indicators were too sparse to allow an outcome effectiveness determination. · Coastal states are utilizing a wide variety of tools to achieve resource protection, including regulatory setbacks and controls over shoreline development in combi- nation with planning, stewardship of state lands, coastal land acquisition, research and public education about shoreline processes and human interactions. All but three coastal states identified protection of natural resources and/or minimi- zation of loss of life and property from coastal hazards as a high-priority management 212 T. Bernd-Cohen and M. Gordon issue. Although all coastal states own coastal properties, only three use state ownership and land management as the primary tool for resource protection. · Regulatory controls appear to be the most significant tools employed nationwide to protect shoreline resources. Protection is sought through setbacks; regulation of shoreline development and shore- line stabilizations; restrictions on pedestrian and vehicular access; habitat protection; and permit compliance/permit-tracking systems. Setbacks can be particularly effective, but the number of exceptions in setback laws raise doubts about the effectiveness of set- backs for resource protection. More accurate and complete outcome information is needed to know whether resource protection or property rights protection is the preferred policy. Planning tools, when combined with regulatory measures, improve natural resource pro- tection by offering long-range vision and/or site-specific goals for the protection and development of selected coastal areas. · CZM programs are upgrading their management tools. State CZM regulations have been altered to better regulate activities along vulner- able coastal shoreline areas. Examples of improvements are more stringent shoreline development setbacks and limitations on the use of shoreline stabilizations. Most amended regulations give greater consideration to natural shoreline processes, even when address- ing other concerns such as the need to protect developed eroding shorelines using struc- tural measures. · There is insufficient nationally compatible outcome data to determine on-the-ground effectiveness. Unfortunately, coastal states and federal agencies are not routinely collecting out- come data we identified as valuable in measuring on-the-ground results of CZM pro- grams. Due to the scarcity of outcome data, it is not possible to determine the on-the- ground effectiveness of state CZM regulatory, planning, land management, and acquisi- tion programs. We still do not know if our “stock” of coastal natural resources is grow- ing or depleting and how state CZM programs influence that trend. For now, judgments on the combined effectiveness of state coastal programs in protecting the natural coast- line resources of the United States, such as beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores, must be based on process indicators and case examples. (Recommendations to improve outcome monitoring and performance evaluation can be found in Hershman et al., 1999.) · Competing demands for the use of the shoreline and competing government poli- cies inhibit full implementation of the protection goal. State CZM programs have to decide regularly between public health, safety, and environmental protection on the one hand, and competing demands for recreation, tour- ist development, protection of existing threatened properties, and the rights of private property owners on the other. Further, inconsistencies between certain federal agency programs and state CZM objectives are ongoing concerns. For example, the FEMA flood insurance program and the federally funded shoreline protection projects of the USACE achieve objectives that undermine some state CZM natural resource protection objec- State Effectiveness in Protecting Natural Shores 213 tives. The unique role of state coastal zone management programs has been and contin- ues to be to focus attention and resources on improving the state and local land use controls and other tools to minimize the adverse impacts on natural resources.
