Course Description This course is designed to familiarize you with how other people, groups, and society as a whole influence an individual’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This course provides an overview of a range of topics within social psychological science. Some of these concepts are social cognition, aggression, emotions and affect, persuasion, prejudice, and prosocial behavior. 1B.

Supplemental None 1C. Course Format This course has an abbreviated, asynchronous schedule, which means that due dates are assigned but you are responsible for scheduling your time such that you complete the activities/quizzes/discussions before the due date and time pass. THIS IS A FULL SEMESTER COURSE PRESENTED IN 7 WEEKS, so you will have twice the work you would expect normally and there is not time for makeups or falling behind. You will have assignments/readings/activities/discussion posts due each week at 11:59pm on the FRIDAY following their being announced. ANY exceptions to these deadlines will be posted clearly on our BrightSpace site. Please note that the last day of class is 28 June and the final exam and final reflection are due on that day. 1D. Course Learning Outcomes Describe and apply key concepts of social psychology Create connections between your own and others’ experiences and social psychological explanations Communicate your ideas about and understanding of course topics in written and alternative formats Demonstrate respectful and appropriate social interaction skills and awareness. 2. Coursework & Grading 2A. Grade Scale Grade Percentage Letter Grade 100-93% A 92-90%  A- 89-87% B+ 86-83% B 82-80% B- 79-77% C+ 76-73% C 72-70% C- 69-60% D 2B. Course Grade Breakdown Students differ in how they approach learning. Because of this, I will invite you to demonstrate your understanding of course material using different types of assessments. While you may find some assignments “come naturally” and others seem more challenging, the combination of assessments provides a multi-dimensional view of the psychological knowledge you have acquired. DISCUSSION BOARD (18% of your final grade) READING QUIZZES (25% of your final grade) CUMULATIVE QUIZZES (35% of your final grade) OTHER ACTIVITIES (7% of your final grade) FINAL EXAM (12% of your final grade) FINAL REFLECTION (3% of your final grade) 2C. Assessment Descriptions & Requirements DISCUSSION BOARD POSTS Some weeks, there will be a required discussion. I will post prompts designed to scaffold your responses, but these are meant to support, rather than constrain, your thinking about social psychology. You are invited to post an original response (meaning you are the author), and to reply to up to two of your classmates' posts. You do not have to agree with the text, or with me - thoughtful and appropriately supported responses will earn full credit. Remember that Psychology is a science; avoid posting responses that are solely opinion whenever possible. There may be up to two (2) discussion threads per week for you to address. We will use a Friday due date for all discussion assignments. Your lowest one (1) discussion grade will be dropped. NO LATE POSTS ARE ACCEPTED. The percentage of points that you earn will count as 18% of your total course grade. \tREADING QUIZZES \tEach week there will be a short quiz on the assigned material. Your lowest two (2) reading quiz grades will be dropped. These quizzes will typically be shorter in length but may be of any type. The percentage of points that you earn in this category will count as 25% of your total course grade. NO LATE QUIZZES ARE ACCEPTED. \tCUMULATIVE QUIZZES \tThere are NO MAKEUPS FOR CUMULATIVE QUIZZES, and NO GRADES WILL BE DROPPED! The percentage of points that you earn in this category will count as 35% of your total course grade. \tOTHER ACTIVITIES: These will typically be worth 5 points each, and the number of activities assigned per week will vary with chapter content. The percentage of points that you earn for these activities will count as 7% of your final course grade. \t \t 2D. Writing Style & Formatting Assignments other than Discussion board posts should adhere to APA 7. 2E. Final Examination/Final Project FINAL REFLECTION PAPER \tThis essay is all about you. It is likely that the material you learn in this course will contribute to shifts in your thinking or perspective. You will write a 2-3 page narrative about what you have learned this semester. What concepts did you find challenging? Did something surprise you on the Discussion board or in other class activities? What material still bugs you – is there somewhere that you feel Socail Psychology has somehow missed the mark? What did you learn about yourself, someone you know well, or about life/society by engaging with social psychological science? How has this class influenced your thinking or behavior in your everyday life? Is there something you see differently now – or something that you now notice that you hadn’t before? I’m not looking for you to recap the course material; I’m looking for you to reflect upon what you have learned and how that has impacted you. What are you taking from this course that is relevant to your life? You have a lot of freedom in this paper, but remember that it is still academic in nature so remember to edit and proofread! THIS ASSIGNMENT IS WORTH 3% of your total course grade and cannot be late. \tFINAL EXAM – will be cumulative and worth 12% of your total course grade. 3.

Absence is not an excuse for missing assignments; however, should you have an extenuating circumstance such as unplanned hospitalization, please contact me. 4B. Late Work Late work is generally not accepted. Discussion posts cannot be made up under any circumstances. Should you have extenuating circumstances that prevent your completing a cumulative quiz, please contact me. Most times this will not be excused. 4C. Potential Deviations from Syllabus This syllabus is only a guide to what will occur over the course. I reserve the right to change the schedule, grading procedures (e.g., the institution of a “curve”), and so forth, on an as-needed basis in order to ensure the educational quality and fairness of the course. I will, however, make every effort to keep any such changes to a minimum. In addition, discussion posts, videos, etc. are not included in the schedule but will be announced at the start of the week in which they are due. 4D. Sharing Personal Information We will be discussing matters that you relate to and have experienced. Connections with, and examples from, your life will undoubtedly come to mind and may be valuable learning moments for both you and your classmates – but I ask you to be mindful about what you share. Remember that we are in an online environment, and although I advocate that what is shared in class stays in class, I cannot guarantee confidentiality. Lively discussion and personal relevance make education more meaningful, but this should never be at the expense of your personal comfort. 4E. Inclement Weather Contingencies Because this class is online, no exceptions to work due dates will be made for inclement weather. Please use your judgment about scheduling your work if you tend to lose connectivity during stormy periods. 4F. Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Coursework Artificial Intelligence is not to be used in this course. Doing so will constitute academic dishonesty. 4G. Faculty Response Time Feedback on assignments will be provided within two weeks of the due date. Emails will be responded to within two business days (weekends are excluded). 4H. Netiquette Our text-based communication is vital in this course since it is the primary - and possibly only - way we will connect with each other. Please be careful and considerate in all your communications with each other and your instructor. The online medium is poor at conveying tone. Consider what you are saying and remember that your intent might not be inferred by your readers (fellow students and instructors). Take a moment to re-read everything you write: assume that it will be taken in the worst possible light. And extend courtesy to others: assume the most charitable light possible. Both of these steps will make communication easier and far more civil. 4I. Academic Integrity To compromise one’s own integrity is to trade what is priceless for what surely is not. Plagiarism is a specific form of cheating consisting of passing off written work under false pretenses. It may be turning in someone else’s work as your own or turning in work you have done for another class as a completed assignment for our course without my consent. Although you have the right to make your own decisions, I want you to know that the decision to cheat in any way on a quiz or plagiarize on any paper will result in a grade of “F” for this course if you are caught, and it may also lead to Institutional penalties as well. Remember that when you choose an action, you also choose the consequences – choose wisely. It is my hope that you will prize your personal honesty above any grade you may obtain; this reflects not only maturity but also self-respect. You never get away with a dishonest act; it just may be that you do not perceive the cost until some later time.
