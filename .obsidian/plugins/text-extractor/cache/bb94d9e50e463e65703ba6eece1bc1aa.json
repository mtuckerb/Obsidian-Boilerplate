Tucker BradfordDr. Sandra DutkowskyPHI-2755 May 2025This is How You Lose the Time War: A Compassion Based AnalysisThis is How You Lose the Time War is a meditation on compassion's capacity tobridge the gap between the self and other. The protagonists' journeys through time,towards and away from each other illustrate some of the preeminent themes ofcompassion as revealed by Confucius, Buddha, Nussbaum, Bein, and Scheller. In thisessay, I will place the novella's narrative within the context of compassion, and illustratehow the authors condense and evangelize the call to compassion.This perspective is narrated by Red, an agent of Technology (though this is onlyimplied in the story). Her adversary (Blue) is an agent of Nature (also implied). As Redcontemplates her opponent, she acknowledges the role she has played in the carnage, andhow it might all be for naught if this opposing player escapes. As she does, she advancesthe first compassionate overture of the story.\"Killing gets easier with practice, in mechanicsand technique. Having killed never does.\" In those 4 words, we learn that Red holdscompassion as an ethically primary trait, and that (in some small way) her compassion forthe planet she has killed has impacted her—in other words, is capable of generatingpersonally directed imperatives—and that it encompasses all those worthy of moralconsideration (Bein 49). Most importantly, in this passage, Red expresses hereudaimonistic judgment (Bein 44). \"having killed never does,\" exposes Red's grief at thesuffering she has caused, and the dissonance that has arisen in her as a result.It is on this battlefield where Red first encounters Blue, though the only contact theyhave is through a taunting, complementary, and slightly flirtatious letter that Blue leaves forRed to find. By reading this letter, Red is cognizant of the fact that she will be \"infected\" byBlue, that she will be exposed to knowledge of Blue that will give rise to compassion andperhaps tip the scales against her side in the time wars. \"It is a trap, of course.\" RedThe story opens on a battlefield. The protagonists (Red and Blue) aredisembodied players in a game which has claimed the life of an entire planet:Both armies lie dead. Two great empires broke themselves here, each a reef to theother’s hull. That is what she came to do. From their ashes others will rise, moresuited to her Agency’s ends. And yet.There was another on the field—no groundling like the time-moored corpsesmounded by her path, but a real player. Someone from the other side.observes before opening the letter. For her part, Blue acknowledges theinterconnectedness of self from the outset. In her opening salvo to Red, she proclaims:What I could not appreciate about this when I read it the first time was the devilishsubtlety of that final statement. At the time I assumed when Blue said \"we\" she wasreferring to Nature. In retrospect, I believe she was referring to the great-self (Bein 137).The remainder of the story is told through letters to and from these two protagonists,and in the moments around the reading or delivering of the letters. These letters are oftendigested by the opponents, and always consumed by a third party, \"the seeker.\" Thisingestion of letters is a metaphor for fellow-feeling (Mitgefühl) (Bein 5), and for emotionalinfection (Bein 4). Additionally it sets the stage for an overarching theme throughout thenovella of similar possibilities: \"similar possibilities, which assesses whether the C-feelerand the C-object (to use Snow’s terminology) are similarly situated in such a way that theC-feeler sees the suffering of the C-object and thinks, 'It could have been me.'” (Bein 43).Later in the story, it is revealed that the eating of letters brings parts of the writer into thereader's self (literally and figuratively).In each of the subsequent letters there are questions asked and discoveries madeabout the other. In this exchange empathy is seeded and cultivated. Blue learns that Red'speople eat, though they do not require it. Red learns that Blue's people do not makefriends, though they are collectivists.I must tell you it gives me great pleasure to think of you reading these words inlicks and whorls of flame, your eyes unable to work backwards, unable to keep theletters on a page; instead you must absorb them, admit them into your memory. Inorder to recall them you must seek my presence in your thoughts, tangled amongthem like sunlight in water. In order to report my words to your superiors you mustadmit yourself already infiltrated, another casualty of this most unfortunate day. Thisis how we'll win.How about you? I don’t mean, necessarily, how do you eat, though if you want tofill me in, be my guest. (Your descriptions of honey and bread—thank you for that.)I’ve described, a bit, our overlapping models —communities public and private,shared interests, shared senses. What’s it like to be a part of yours? Do you havefriends, Blue? And how? You asked me to tell truths. I have. What do I want?Understanding. ExchangeThrough this mutual discovery Red and Blue begin the process of merging their field ofselves (Bein 65). In describing their overlapping models, you can almost see the fieldsmerging. Red is explicitly asking to bring Blue's world into perspective, to understand whatis inexplicable to her. Bein grants the value of this kind of understanding and perspectiveshifting as (at least one) definition of compassion.To attempt to perceive the world from another person’s perspective and to refuse toseparate the advancement of that person’s interests from the advancement of one’s own isnot a bad definition of compassion. (Bein 72)As the story progresses, the great self takes center stage. The lines between theseagents of Technology and Nature blur until they begin to disappear entirely. Oneinterpretation of this story that appeals to me is that these agents are representative of thevery best qualities of each of their factions, and that by merging their field of selves, theyare creating a harmony between nature and technology. In a letter from Blue to Red, wesee a lesson and an entreaty to join themselves in a field of selves.For her part, Red shares how she has brought Blue into her, \"When she is sure no oneis watching, she rereads the letters she’s carved into herself.\" If this were merely a story oftwo individuals (it does share some common themes with Romeo and Juliet) this grandanalogy to compassion might feel somewhat anemic. What makes it such a compellingplayground for exploring compassion is that these characters, with their strikingly genericnames, expansive qualities, and indeed myriad embodiments of the great self itself arethemselves facets of a fractured anatmān.In the culmination of this riveting tale, Red is forced by her leadership to create apoisoned letter to Blue. She tries to warn Blue (through a preemptive letter) not to read(consume) it, but is unsurprised when Blue knowingly ingests the poison. Red nowbecomes the seeker. Trailing themself through time and space, the seeker consumesscraps of Red and Blue, making themself whole in the field of self. The seeker pauses attimes to observe the prescience of their words to each other. \"How long had she plannedthis? How long did you know, my mood indigo?\" and as they recognize that they (and allthat they represent) have always been one self, they also acknowledge the rupture as wellas the repair that great self requires.I have been birds and branches. I have been bees and wolves. I have beenether flooding the void between stars, tangling their breath into networks of song. Ihave been fish and plankton and humus, and all these have been me. But while I’vebeen enmeshed in this wholeness—they are not the whole of me… but I look at you,Red, and see much of myselfThus embodied (Red within Blue within Red, etc.) The seeker is able to penetrate timeand the immune system of Nature to find Blue. Yet even upon arriving in nature's hallowedsanctuary, as the seeker treads Garden's bed, they wonder if they have truly achieved thecompassion required to heal what was ruptured. When seeker wonders \"Is she Blueenough?\" they are questioning whether they have sufficiently understood and empathizedwith what it means to be Blue, to exist in her space without being rejected as other. Or putanother way, are they (the seeker) anatmān or still Red's ego self (Bein 98 & 109).The triumph of This is how you lose the time war, is revealed in the final pages. The seekerfinds juvenile Blue—a princess waking as if from a dream—in Garden's bed. Thismanifestation of anatmān (seeker) kisses young Blue, cutting their lip on Blue's rows ofrazor sharp teeth, and bestowing the gift of no-self—of connection—onto the child. \"Takethis of me, Red [as seeker] thinks. Carry it in yourself, a root fed by what would kill it. Carryhunger all your days. Let it guard you, guide you, save you.\" Blue then consciously acceptsthe gift, \"The gaze of the girl who would be Blue fixes on her, soft with dreams, trusting.She tastes what she is offered, knows the pain in it, and swallows.\" In accepting what isoffered, young Blue begins her compassionate journey. Always cognizant of her great-self,she enters the war seeking understanding of her enemy, not to defeat her, but to becomeone with her. Blue (and depending on how you hold time, Red as well) never intended towin the time war for her Shift (faction), she intended to win the time war for the great self.The final lines of the story contain the the cherry that adorns this metaphor of compassion.As Red (post seeker, but still Blue in Red in Blue, etc.) is thrown into her cell back at theAgency, she finds a final letter from Blue.She shades herself with Blue, from blood, tears, skin, ink, words. She thrasheswith the pain of growth inside her: new organs bloom from autosynthesized stemcells to shoulder old bits of her away. Green vines twine her heart and seize it, andshe vomits and sweats until the vines’ rhythm matches hers. A second skin growswithin her skin, popping, blistering. She claws herself off upon the rocks like a snakeand lies transformed. And more: A different mind plays around the edges of her own.There’s still a war out there, of course. But this is a strategy untested. Whatwould Genghis say if we built a bridge together, Red? Suppose we reached acrossthe burn of threads and tangles, cut through the braid’s knots—suppose that wedefected, not to each other’s sides, but to each other? [...] Shall we prick and twistand play the braid until it yields us a place downthread, bend the fork of our Shiftsinto a double helix around our base pair?In this passage, Blue is overtly suggesting to (post-seeker) Red that they are one self,inexorably tied in past, present and future, and that the destruction that has been wroughtto all of existence throughout time is perhaps due to the rupture that their Shifts created inthe great self; a rupture that can be repaired through their merging.The story, and my essay, concludes with this glorious quote that I feel represents the nexusof compassion as I have been seeking to comprehend and internalize it throughout thissemester:The Ethic of Compassion provides a model in which the individual (concentric modelof) self is not capable of winning or losing. The only win condition that is possible in anEthic of Compassion is a we state victory, in which we represents all of existence. For thisreason, I am proudly advancing compassion to the highest echelon of my personal valuesystem. May it guide us well.I don’t give a shit who wins this war, Garden or the Agency— towards whoseShift the arc of the universe bends. But maybe this is how we win, Red. You and me.This is how we win.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
