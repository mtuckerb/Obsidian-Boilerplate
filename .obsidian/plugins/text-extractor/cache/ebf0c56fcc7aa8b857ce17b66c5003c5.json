Szymanski University of Tennessee Susan Kashubeck-West Jill Meyer University of Missouri–St. Louis Counseling psychologists can expect to encounter lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals in their lives, as students, colleagues, friends, clients, and/or family members. Most of the LGB individuals encountered by counseling psy- chologists have experienced the negative consequences of internalized heterosexism/internalized homophobia (IH). Yet many counseling psychologists are not adequately prepared to deal with the negative effects of IH on LGB persons’ lives. This Major Contribution provides readers with a critical base of information about the construct of IH, including the historical context from which it emerged; controversies related to IH; theoretical approaches used to conceptualize IH; unique issues for women, men, and bisexuals; and the empirical research on measurement and psychosocial correlates of IH. In addi- tion, it provides suggestions for future research and implications for coun- seling LGB individuals and for the training of counseling psychologists. T his Major Contribution focuses on internalized heterosexism (IH), defined as the internalization by lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) indi- viduals of negative attitudes and assumptions about homosexuality that are prevalent in society (Sophie, 1987). Huebner, Davis, Nemeroff, and Aiken (2002) noted that most theories of LGB identity development hold that these identities are formed in a cultural context of extreme stigma toward same-sex romantic, emotional, and sexual behavior. Thus, inevitably, LGB people are likely to have some level of internalized oppression related to their status as members of a stigmatized group. As Gonsiorek and Rudolph (1991) noted, the toll that IH can take on LGB individuals ranges from mild (a tendency toward self-doubt) to severe (overt self-hatred and self-destructive Szymanski et al. / Internalized Heterosexism 511 behavior). While an LGB person may unlearn some of this internalized oppression (Meyer & Dean, 1998), the fact that anti-LGB socialization is typically quite powerful means that eliminating all traces of IH in oneself is an unlikely achievement (Huebner et al., 2002). Thus, most LGB people are likely to be negatively affected by varying degrees of IH throughout their lives (Malyon, 1982). The political visibility of LGB individuals and their concerns, such as the right to marry and to adopt children, has dramatically increased in the past few years. Accompanying this increase in visibility has been a powerful effort to restrict the civil rights of LGB people. For example, voters in every state that had a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage on the ballot in 2004 approved these amendments to state constitutions, many by wide margins. LGB individuals in the United States may experience increased IH in the wake of often harsh attacks by individuals and social institutions (Russell & Richards, 2003). Counseling psychologists are poten- tially valuable sources of assistance for LGB persons who are struggling with IH, given their employment in a variety of community, university, school, business, and hospital settings. Historical Overview and Controversies Related to IH Weinberg (1972) introduced the term homophobia to describe hetero- sexual persons’ irrational fear and dread of being in close contact with LGB persons and the term internalized homophobia to describe LGB persons’ own self-loathing related to being a sexual minority person. In his book, he challenged the zeitgeist of the times by indicating that homophobia was a form of prejudice that often led to brutality, that the problem of homosexu- ality was not LGB people but intolerant heterosexual persons, and that homophobia was a consequence of the enforcement of traditional male gender norms (Herek, 2004). While recognizing Weinberg’s important contribution to psychology and to the LGB community, it is important to note that the terms homophobia and internalized homophobia have been criticized for being inadequate descriptors of the external and internalized oppression experienced by LGB persons. For example, the term homophobia has been criticized for its narrow focus on fear and avoidance of sexual minority persons and the use of clinical language to pathologize and stigmatize a disliked pattern of attitudes 512 The Counseling Psychologist (Herek, 1994, 1995, 2004). In addition, Herek (2004) noted that research fails to detect intense fear and anxiety responses when heterosexuals view photographs of men having sex with men, and other data suggest that dis- gust and anger, rather than fear, are central to heterosexuals’ negative atti- tudes and emotional responses to LGB persons. Thus, the diagnostic term phobia is not an accurate way to describe such responses. In addition, lesbian feminists have criticized the term homophobia for the following reasons: for not really being an irrational fear, because lesbianism, homosexuality, and bisexuality are real threats to male dominance and heteropatriarchal values and structures; for contextualizing prejudice within the individual rather than in the broader social, political, and cultural context; for androcentrism in the term homophobia (e.g., interpreting homosexual to mean gay man); and for failing to account for the interlocking oppressions of sexism and heterosexism that make lesbian and bisexual women’s experience of oppres- sion fundamentally different from that of gay and bisexual men (Kitzinger, 1996; Kitzinger & Perkins, 1993; Pharr, 1988; Rich, 1980). Because of these criticisms, several authors have proposed alternative terms, such as homonegativity (Hudson & Ricketts, 1980; Morrow, 2000), internalized homonegativity (Mayfield, 2001), heterosexism (Herek, 1995), and internalized heterosexism (Szymanski, 2004; Szymanski & Chung, 2003a). Homonegativity refers to persons’ negative affect and beliefs about LGB orientations, and it overcomes some of the criticisms of the term homophobia. However, Szymanski and Chung (2003a) argued that this term glosses over the systemic and pervasive nature of homophobia as an institution in favor of viewing it as negative attitudes on the part of individuals. Heterosexism, a term developed within the LGB rights movement and modeled on political concepts, refers to an ideological system that operates on individual, insti- tutional, and cultural levels to stigmatize, deny, and denigrate any nonhetero- sexual way of being (Herek, 1995; Kitzinger, 1996). Several authors have argued that heterosexism and internalized heterosexism are more appropriate terms because they allow for a broader range of negative attitudes and emotions toward sexual minority persons; locate prejudice within the broader social, cultural, and political context rather than within the individual; and include the term sexism within heterosexism and thus highlight the important role that gender plays in the oppression of sexual minorities and suggest a relationship between sexism and heterosexism (Herek, 1994, 2004; Kitzinger & Perkins, 1993; Szymanski, 2004; Szymanski & Chung, 2003a). Therefore, we use the terms heterosexism and internalized heterosexism throughout this Major Contribution. Szymanski et al. / Internalized Heterosexism 513 Along with addressing the terminology controversies related to IH, several authors (cf. Kitzinger, 1996; Kitzinger & Perkins, 1993; Perkins, 1991) have identified potential problems inherent in the concept of IH. Kitzinger and Perkins (1993) and Perkins (1991) asserted that the concept of IH pathologizes the distress experienced by LGB individuals because of oppression and so focuses on oppression as a private issue requiring individual adjustment, rather than as a political and cultural issue requiring social change. In addition, the construct of IH implicitly represents weakness and ignores the resilience demonstrated by LGB persons in the face of cultural heterosexism (Kitzinger, 1996). It is important to remember that the IH seen in many LGB persons is a result of pervasive external heterosexism. The many forms of heterosexism in U.S. society, ranging from invisibility to outright violence, encourage LGB people not to know themselves and not to speak their truths but rather to engage in lies of silence (Brown, 1994). Thus, the use of the construct of IH can be potentially harmful when using an intrapsychic focus in counseling because the suffering of LGB people under heterosexism may be translated into viewing the client as having poor psychological health, thus moving the locus of analysis from the societal context to the person. As discussed in detail in Kashubeck-West, Szymanski, and Meyer (2008 [this issue]), we believe that it is critical for counselors to help LGB clients locate their struggles within the societal context of heterosexism. Theoretical Approaches Used to Conceptualize IH Two theoretical approaches have been used to conceptualize the impact of heterosexism on LGB person’s lives—feminist theory (cf. Brown, 1988, 1994; Rotosky & Riggle, 2002; Szymanski, 2005a, 2005b, 2006) and minority stress theory (cf. Balsam & Szymanski, 2005; Bos, van Balen, van den Boom, & Sandfort, 2004; DiPlacido, 1998; Meyer, 1995, 2003). Feminist theory posits that the personal is political, which means that personal difficulties are connected to the political, cultural, social, and economic climate in which people live and that many of the problems experienced by persons with limited power in society can be conceptualized as reactions to oppression (Brown, 1988, 1994; Enns, 2004; Worell & Remer, 2003). This feminist principle suggests that heterosexism is likely to contribute to LGB persons’ psychosocial problems directly via heterosexist experiences of invisibility, 514 The Counseling Psychologist rejection, prejudice, harassment, discrimination, and violence. In addition, this principle postulates that as a result of various forms of cultural heterosexism, LGB persons will internalize negative and limiting heterosexist messages to varying degrees, which can lead to psychological distress (Brown, 1988; Szymanski, 2005a). Consistent with feminist theory, research has demon- strated that external and internalized heterosexism are uniquely related to poorer mental health (Meyer, 1995; Szymanski, 2005b); however, little is known about the mechanisms by which an individual may be more likely to internalize these negative messages. For example, factors that may affect one’s experiences with IH include the nature, degree, type, and frequency of heterosexism in the environment; the importance of perpetrators of hetero- sexism or heterosexist messages to the self (e.g., heterosexist messages from family and religion; messages that LGB persons are disgusting, immoral, and sick); a lack of exposure to countermessages (e.g., LGB-affirmative messages, positive LGB role models, heterosexual allies); and the importance of LGB identity to the self. Feminist theorists also assert the need for an integrated analysis of oppression. This principle focuses on understanding the influence of multiple socially constructed identities, such as race, gender, and sexual orientation. Feminist theorists emphasize the importance of understanding how diverse sources of oppression (e.g., sexism, classism, racism) interact and influence psychosocial well-being and the experience of external and internalized heterosexism (Brown, 1994; Szymanski, 2005a, 2005b, 2008). Drawing from multicultural feminist theoretical perspectives on the experiences of African American women, Moradi and Subich (2003) identified four approaches to conceptualize the impact of multiple oppressions on psy- chosocial health: The first, a primary oppression perspective, postulates that one form of oppression (e.g., external and internalized heterosexism) expe- rienced by a person with multiple identities (e.g., lesbian) will be the most important source of oppression and so directly affect psychosocial health. Thus, this perspective ignores or downplays the role of other sources of oppression (e.g., external and internalized sexism). The second, an additive perspective, posits that each oppression (e.g., external and internalized heterosexism and sexism) experienced by a person with more than one minority status is important and has direct effects that combine additively to negatively affect mental health. The third, an interactionist perspective, builds on the additive perspective by postulating an additional tenet: the multiplicative effects of multiple oppressions on psychosocial health. Thus, in addition to direct effects negatively affecting mental health, one form of Szymanski et al. / Internalized Heterosexism 515 oppression (e.g., external and internalized sexism) may interact with and intensify another form of oppression (e.g., external and internalized hetero- sexism) experienced by a person with more than one minority status (e.g., lesbian), which may lead to poorer psychosocial health. The fourth, an intersectionality perspective, posits that separate dimensions of oppression (e.g., external and internalized heterosexism and sexism) and their various points of fusion (e.g., the unique combination of external and internalized heterosexism and sexism) can negatively affect psychosocial health. This perspective rejects the artificial dichotomization of diverse sources of oppressions and suggests that each group’s unique position (e.g., lesbian) within a matrix of social organization may be different or greater than the sum of its parts (e.g., gender and sexual orientation). That is, when a les- bian experiences discrimination or internalizes negative messages about her group, it may be a result of her being a lesbian, not a woman or a sexual minority. Most research on LGB experiences has focused on the examination of external and internalized heterosexism as a primary form of oppression (for a review, see Szymanski, Kashubeck-West, & Meyer, 2008 [this issue]). Only a handful of studies (i.e., Chung & Szymanski, 2006; From, 2000; Piggot, 2004; Szymanski, 2005b) have begun to explore the relationships among various forms of oppression experienced by LGB persons with multiple minority statuses and their influence on psychosocial health. Clearly, theory- driven research is needed to examine the effect that multiple forms of oppres- sion have on mental health. In this vein, Szymanski and Kashubeck-West (2008 [this issue]) empirically test some of these feminist theory tenets by examining the affect of IH and internalized sexism on lesbian and bisexual women’s psychological distress. Finally, feminist theorists offer several strategies for reducing the negative influences of external and internalized heterosexism and other forms of oppression on LGB lives—for example, cultural, gender, and power analyses; training in confrontation of oppression; bibliotherapy; and social advocacy and activism (cf. Brown, 1988, 1994; Enns, 2004; Szymanski, 2005a; Worell & Remer, 2003). Kashubeck-West and Szymanski (2008 [this issue]) discuss how to integrate feminist approaches to address IH in clinical practice and counseling psychology training and how to engage in social justice advocacy to eradicate heterosexism at the micro level (individual), meso level (com- munities and organizations), and macro levels (social structures, policies, and ideologies). 516 The Counseling Psychologist Elaborating on social stress theory (e.g., Dohrenwend, 2000) and infer- ring concepts from several social psychological and sociological theories that describe the adverse effects that social conditions such as stigma and prejudice have on minority persons (e.g., Allport, 1954; Crocker, Major, & Steele, 1998), minority stress theory posits that persons from stigmatized social categories experience excess stress and negative life events because of their minority status or statuses (Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 1995, 2003). Meyer (2003) asserted that minority stress is unique, chronic, and socially based; that is, minority stress is additive to general stressors that are expe- rienced by all people and thus requires more adaptation. In addition, minority stress stems from relatively stable underlying social structures, institutions, and processes beyond the individual, rather than from biological or genetic characteristics of the person or from individual conditions or events that characterize general stressors. Drawing from Lazarus and Folkman’s concepts (1984) of distal and proximal stressors, LGB minority stress theorists and researchers have frequently conceptualized such stress as being composed of external and internal stress processes (cf. Balsam & Szymanski, 2005; Bos et al., 2004; DiPlacido, 1998; Meyer, 1995, 2003). External, or distal, minority stressors include experiences of anti-LGB harassment, discrimination, and violence, whereas internal, or proximal, stressors include IH, perceptions of stigma associated with being LGB, self-concealment, and emotional inhibition (DiPlacido, 1998; Meyer, 1995, 2003). Minority stress theorists have asserted that these stress processes can create mental health problems for LGB indi- viduals. Furthermore, Meyer (2003) suggested that individual coping and support (e.g., resilience, hardiness, coping styles and strategies, social support systems) and LGB community coping and support (e.g., LGB social groups, services of an LGB affirmative church) can help ameliorate the negative effects of minority stress. In addition, he postulated that characteristics of minority identity (e.g., prominence of minority identity within an individual’s sense of self) may be related to minority stress and its affect on psychosocial health, both in direct form and in interaction with various stressors. While we agree with Meyer’s assertions (2003) that individual and LGB community coping and support may moderate the relationship between external heterosexist events and psychosocial health, we argue that these variables are more likely to act as mediators in the relationship between IH and psychological distress and well-being. In her sexual identity development model, Cass (1979) asserted that people with high IH may be more likely Szymanski et al. / Internalized Heterosexism 517 to engage in avoidant coping strategies, such as restricting awareness of or exposure to information regarding LGB persons and culture, inhibiting same-sex behavior, denying personal relevance of information regarding LGB persons, passing or pretending heterosexuality, and living a double life with a secret sexual minority self. Additionally, she suggested that reducing IH is an important precursor to coming out to others, increasing one’s social support network, and developing proactive coping strategies. Thus, IH is likely to negatively impact one’s personal coping resources, lead to the use of ineffective coping strategies, and limit an LGB person’s access to community and social support systems, which will in turn lead to poorer mental health. Consistent with Cass’s theory, research demonstrates that IH is related to more conflict concerning sexual orientation, increased frequency of passing as a heterosexual, more avoidant coping, less social support, less satisfaction with social support, and less connection with the LGB community (see Szymanski et al., 2008, for a review). In addition to citing individual and community coping and support, we assert that self-esteem is another potential mediator in the relationship between IH and psychosocial health. According to the looking glass self theory proposed by sociologists such as Cooley (1956) and Mead (1934), self-esteem develops through interactions with others and is a reflection of those others’ appraisals of oneself. This perspective suggests that LGB persons who are aware that they are regarded negatively by specific people or by the wider culture will incorporate those negative attitudes (e.g., IH) into their self-concept and consequently be lower in self-esteem (Crocker & Major, 1989). Consistent with minority stress theory, research has demonstrated that external and internal stressors are uniquely related to poorer psychological health (cf. DiPlacido, 1998; Meyer, 1995; Szymanski, 2005b). However, scant research (see Szymanski et al., 2008, for a review) exists examining the theorized moderating and mediating roles of individual coping and social support, community coping and social support, and self-esteem in the rela- tionship between external and internal minority stressors and mental health. As such, Szymanski and Kashubeck-West (2008) investigate whether self-esteem and social support mediate the relationship between internalized oppressions and psychological distress among lesbians and bisexual women. In sum, feminist and minority stress theorists argue that environmental factors (e.g., discrimination, prejudice) are responsible for the creation of IH as well as the psychosocial problems associated with it. However, they differ in how they frame the issues, with feminist theorists taking a more 518 The Counseling Psychologist contextualized, sociocultural/political perspective and with minority stress theorists taking more of an individual psychological view. Feminist and minority stress theorists also diverge somewhat in their explanations concerning the relationship between IH and psychological distress. Integrating aspects of sexual identity development and sociological theory into feminist theory suggests that IH will have direct and mediated effects (through individual and community coping and social supports and self- esteem) on psychological distress, whereas minority stress theorists propose direct and moderated effects (via interactions with individual and community coping and social supports). In addition, feminist theory clearly posits how diverse sources of oppression may impact mental health. Unique Issues for Women, Men, and Bisexuals Although LGB persons share many similarities based on their sexual minority status, they do have differences, with some characteristics being unique to each group. Several feminist theorists have suggested that when working with LGB clients, concepts of gender and gender role socialization may be more salient than sexual orientation. These theorists have suggested that traditional gender role socialization may contribute to differences between women and men in the experience of IH (e.g., the fusion of IH with external and internalized sexism for women), in the type of rationalizations made for same-sex attraction and behavior (e.g., women tend to avoid self-identification as sexual minorities by emphasizing their feelings, while men tend to cope by denying their feelings), in the coming-out process (e.g., women tend to come out later than men and come out in the context of a relationship rather than through acting on sexual desire alone), and through relationship issues (e.g., women tend to value emotional expressiveness and sexual exclusivity more than men do; McCarn & Fassinger, 1996; Szymanski & Chung, 2003b; Whitman, 1995). These gender socialization influences are also likely to affect the issues that sexual minority women and men bring to therapy. For example, women in general report suffering from depression at much higher levels than those of men (Mazure, Keita, & Blehar, 2002), and lesbians likewise bring issues associated with depression and anxiety to counseling. Similarly, men are at higher risk for problems related to substance use and abuse than women are, and gay men are no less likely than hetero- sexual men to have problems with substance use (and some studies suggest that they may be more likely; see Szymanski et al., 2008). Thus, counseling psychologists need to be attuned to possible substance use issues in their gay male clients. As another example, HIV/AIDS is often a primary concern of men who have sex with men, whereas it is typically of little concern for lesbians (Kauth, Hartwig, & Kalichman, 2000). As can be seen, gender is clearly related to the problems and difficulties faced by sexual minority men and women. Studies that investigate IH within gender are clearly needed. In light of such gender differences, Szymanski and Kashubeck-West (2008) investigate how IH, along with other variables, may predict psychological distress for sexual minority women, and Kashubeck-West and Szymanski (2008) examine how IH along with other variables may predict risky sexual behavior in men who have sex with men. In addition to differences between women and men are the unique issues that exist for bisexual persons. While lesbians and gay men need to acknowl- edge and affirm their same-sex attractions and relationships to achieve posi- tive and integrated sexual identities, bisexuals need to acknowledge and affirm both the heterosexual and the same-sex components of their identities (Fox, 2000). Furthermore, bisexuals must deal with societal oppression, or bisexism (most commonly referred to as biphobia in the literature) and inter- nalized forms of this oppression, in addition to dealing with heterosexism and IH (Dworkin, 2001; Fox, 2000; Guidry, 1999; Ochs, 1996). Biphobia is defined as a dislike or fear of those who do not identify as either lesbian/gay or heterosexual (Dworkin, 2001). As noted earlier in this article, the use of the term phobia to describe such dislike or fear is problematic, and we choose to replace the term biphobia with bisexism. Bisexism manifests itself in denying the existence of bisexual people and in rejecting and alienating them (Ochs, 1996). Bisexual people are stereotyped as being promiscuous and untrust- worthy, as gays or lesbians who refuse to embrace their sexuality, and as unwilling to give up heterosexual privilege (Israel & Mohr, 2004). Thus, they are subject to significant prejudice from the gay and lesbian community and the heterosexual community and may feel a sense of lack of belonging anywhere. Internalized bisexism refers to the internalization of these negative messages about bisexuality, feelings of conflict and shame concerning one’s bisexuality, and possible feelings of guilt for betraying one’s identity group when a bisexual person ends a relationship with a member of the same sex and later gets involved with a member of the opposite sex (Guidry, 1999; Ochs, 1996). Thus, separate research is needed on bisexual persons to examine the impact of heterosexism and bisexism on bisexual person’s lives and to address their unique identities and issues. Szymanski et al. / Internalized Heterosexism 519520 The Counseling Psychologist Major Contribution on IH IH has a lengthy, rich, and controversial history as a core construct in LGB psychology. Given feminist and minority stress theorists’ assertions that heterosexism can have damaging effects on LGB lives, it is impera- tive that counseling psychologists have a critical base of information about the construct of IH. Thus, this Major Contribution serves as a foun- dation for counseling psychologists who are working with LGB clients around this issue. In this first article, we have discussed the historical con- text from which the construct of IH emerged; controversies related to IH; theoretical approaches used to conceptualize IH; and unique issues for women, men, and bisexuals. The second article in this Major Contribution (Szymanski et al., 2008) critiques popular scales used to measure IH, pro- vides a critical review of empirical research on psychosocial correlates of IH, and offers suggestions for future research. The third (Szymanski & Kashubeck-West, 2008) and fourth (Kashubeck-West & Szymanski, 2008) articles present the results of two empirical studies designed to fill some of the gaps in the existing literature, one focusing on sexual minor- ity women and the other on sexual minority men. Finally, the fifth article (Kashubeck-West et al., 2008) integrates theory and research on IH to provide clinical suggestions for counseling psychologists who are working with LGB clients and implications for counseling psychologist training.
