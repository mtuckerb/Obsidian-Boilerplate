This submission brings together a collaborative team convened by Regen Sydney, Blue Green and ThinkPlace. Together, our team combines local knowledge with global best practice in urban regeneration, community-led design, and climate adaptation. We are confident this partnership provides a strong foundation to deliver a high- impact precinct plan aligned with Infrastructure Australia’s priorities for resilient, connected and sustainable urban infrastructure. Working with Country We acknowledge the Gadigal people as original owners and continuing custodians of this land. We recognise their survival and connection with their Country spanning more than 40,000 years. We imagine a vision for Yarranabbe, which will strengthen this legacy. The Rushcutters Bay Precinct Plan create a thriving and prosperous environment where communities and visitors can connect with Country. We will approach all aspects of the project through this lens, working in close partnership with, and drawing inspiration from, First Nations people’s goals to care for Country, to build greater understanding of place and our shared futures within it. Our work will synthesise Aboriginal knowledge, contemporary practice and leading technology to create inclusive places, integrating natural and human systems, while connecting with stories of place and allowing us all a connection with Country.

Over a 14-month period, we seek to co-design with community, First Nations leaders, and government to restore ecology, improve infrastructure, and prepare for climate risks. In undertaking this work we hope to create both an Investment Ready Precinct Plan for Rushcutters Bay, but also a playbook and prototype for practical resilient urban regeneration, climate mitigation and the creation of great urban parks across Australia. Reimagining and Regenerating A reimagining of Rushcutters Bay offers an opportunity to explore ways in which our harbourside suburbs can regenerate and enhance both their private and public spaces, while remaining unique places to live and centres of activity, for diverse populations and ecologies. This area has been this before and can be so again. For millennia, these lands have been Kogerah, Gurrajin, and Yarranabbe, in Gadigal Country, a vital gathering place and ecological sanctuary. As the confluence of waterways and Aboriginal travelling routes, the area has always been a significant point during journeys along and across Warrane (Sydney Harbour). A place for walking and singing up Country, fishing, hunting and harvesting food from the foreshores, wetlands and forests, economic exchange and abundance. Importantly, the area’s sheltered riparian valleys and wetland clearings provided places for meeting, and for events, ceremonies and celebrations. About this Place Rushcutters Bay is one of the most unique suburbs in Sydney, rich in deep history and future potential, in the midst of a global city undergoing transformational change. It is one in a band of suburbs located along Sydney Harbour, framed by the confluences of land and water, and now subject to pressures both on the land and sea. Any future plans for the bay, and its catchment, in addition to being resilient and regenerative, will also need to address the community’s aspirations and government’s vision, to guide the delivery of public amenity, housing, open space and community infrastructure. Importantly, a robust and considered design framework and guiding principles must ensure that community values and place character are protected and enhanced, providing much-needed civic assets to the community, and reinforcing local ecologies, both cultural and environmental. 'Port Jackson, N.S. Wales' by Thomas Florance, 1834 Mitchell Map Collection item, State Library of NSW The wetlands shown here are a near perfect match to todays flood risk zones. 3 Congregation and celebration have continued here since colonisation, culminating in Sydney Stadium, at one time the largest roofed space on the planet. Built in 1908, it was the site of the first world championship bout featuring a black man, African American Jack Johnson. The Stadium later hosted every global luminary to visit Sydney, from Frank Sinatra to the Beatles. Before it was a stadium, it was White City, the amusement park, based, as all White Cities around the world were, on the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition, which was, among many other things, the beginning of city planning (the City Beautiful movement), and the first \"innovation precinct.\" However aspirational, these past two centuries of development have also fostered exclusionary urbanisation, monocultural infrastructure and environmental degradation, deeply disrupting the area’s natural systems, community connections and cultural continuity. Project Intent and Approach This project aims to resolve structural barriers that have prevented Rushcutters Bay from achieving a coordinated, resilient and sustainable vision for its future. Our approach emphasises restoration, reconnection and regeneration. While complex technical solutions are needed, the true potential of this plan lies in its capacity to reunite natural ecological systems with human cultural activities. Our initial community engagement suggests that we can eventually leverage four infrastructure classes to transform the precinct: • Nature-based infrastructure: Boardwalks, living shorelines, daylighted creeks, and restored marine habitats to boost biodiversity and reduce coastal risk. • Social and cultural infrastructure: Arts, heritage, recreation, and sports spaces allowing social and ecological systems to thrive. • Transport and connectivity: Reconnecting severed active transport corridors with integrated walking, ferry and cycle connections. • Utilities and services works: Modernised stormwater, sewage, and electrified marine infrastructure for a resilient future. Change before the crisis Crucially, this project allows us to act before the now inevitable disaster, preventing property loss and mitigating community trauma, accomplished in a cost-effective way. Rather than relying on reactionary responses, our approach offers a prototype for a more resilient, inclusive and nature-positive urban future. 'Aboriginal people hunting waterbirds among the rushes, c1817' Joseph Lycett in Drawings of Aborigines and scenery, New South Wales, National Library of Australia This image shows the stark contrast from the managed land of the Gadigal and the raw sewage and building waste flowing into the harbour in the top right image taken in May 2025. 4 Risks and Constraints Uniquely all 53ha of the project site is entirely government owned land but managed across multiple land tenures and governance frameworks. These include the City of Sydney, Woollahra Council, state-owned roads, rail, water assets, and Crown lands, with change requiring consensus across nineteen government entities and agencies. Physical risks are immediate and increasing. A large portion of the parkland, already vulnerable to flooding and storm surge, is projected to be regularly inundated by 2050. The canal infrastructure from the 1890’s, while heritage-listed, is functionally obsolete, and contributes to poor water quality in the Harbour. Urban disconnection, inaccessibility, aging infrastructure and habitat loss further reduce the precinct’s climate resilience and community value. The loss of this place to unmanaged climate impacts would not only be an environmental and economic catastrophe, but also profoundly disrupt the entire cities social, cultural and community capital. Challenges and Opportunities Rushcutters Bay now sits at the intersection of three converging crises: rising climate risk, biodiversity collapse and housing unaffordability. Despite these pressures, there has never been a consolidated, future-focused precinct plan for this complex, multi- jurisdictional area. The project represents an opportunity to address all three crises, through a Country-led and nature-positive urban transformation. This approach is ambitious in scope but grounded in feasibility (what can be done), viability (what can be self-funded), desirability (what the community wants), responsibility (what is healthy for Country and community) and suitability (what is right for this place). While this area is known as one of the richest areas in Australia, it is precisely this available wealth and capacity that enables the development of this critical precinct plan to make possible an actionable and regenerative prototype for threatened urban waterfronts across Australia. Our consortium for change We collectively, as Australians, are not helpless in the face of the crisis, and it is from this groundswell that this project has emerged. We are not a group of developers or agents of legislative power, we are a group of passionate, knowledgeable, capable and creative experts who have come together as volunteers to develop an aspiration that through this grant we seek to realise. The consortium we have assembled for this project brings together leading architects, academics and Aboriginal leaders alongside experts, ecologists, community engagement specialists, planners and cultural practitioners. Working together with community, business and governments, our team will produce a plan that effectively addresses the criteria of the uPPP, while responding authentically to place, people, and purpose.

Detailed Description: The Rushcutters Bay Precinct Plan is a community and design-led strategy to transform one of Sydney’s most iconic but vulnerable harbour precincts into a national demonstration of climate resilience, cultural restoration, and inclusive precinct design. This project will produce an investment- ready precinct plan for Rushcutters Bay through a 14-month co-design process that brings together government, community, First Nations, and industry partners. Key activities include technical site and climate risk studies, cultural and ecological mapping, community and stakeholder engagement, collaborative design workshops, impact modelling, and delivery staging. A multidisciplinary consortium will activate and formalise enduring partnerships, align public, private and civic interests to jointly plan, fund and deliver resilient, inclusive, and climate- adapted urban infrastructure across this and other vulnerable foreshore precincts. 7 Navy Bear Cafe, RAN SA Delivered by consortium partner, Lucy Humphrey Studio The plan will address four infrastructure domains across the National Urban Policies to focus on productivity, equity, sustainability, liveability and resilience. • Nature & Climate infrastructure • Cultural & Social infrastructure • Transport infrastructure • Utilities & services infrastructure It does this by embedding First Nations knowledge systems and local values through robust, inclusive co-design. The project will create a feasible, desirable and viable precinct plan that is investment-ready and scalable to other coastal urban areas. 8 Section 3 Project Alignment with Australian Government Policy Sydney 2035 Metropolitan Strategy Delivered by consortium partner, Craig Allchin of Six Degrees Urban Alignment with the National Urban Policy (draft 2024) The project delivers a place-based, multi-purpose precinct plan aligned with National Urban Policy priorities: • Supporting climate adaptation through nature-based infrastructure, specifically flood-mitigation in high value areas of Sydney Harbour. • Enhancing housing supply via transport adjacent housing with the potential of creating 2,000 units. • Embedding equity and cultural inclusion through First Nations co- design by honouring, resurfacing and interpreting a nationally significant Aboriginal water course. • Improving liveability with arts, recreation, and green space access by integrated art across the precinct. • Advancing sustainability via blue- green infrastructure and circular economy practices especially in the marine services sector. • Building productivity and resilience through integrated transport and marine economy renewal. National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy (2021-2025) The project aligns with the Strategy’s three key objectives: • Drive investment and action through collaboration. • Improve climate information and decision-making • Assess progress & improve over time. Key deliverables of our project aligned with this strategy are: • Brings together federal, state, local government, First Nations, industry, and community in a shared plan for place-based climate resilience. • Aligns infrastructure upgrades with coastal protection, public health and economic outcomes using Nature- based Solutions like Living shorelines and floodable parklands. • Will assess site-specific sea level rise, flooding and biodiversity loss data to shape infrastructure choices. • Designs a replicable precinct planning methodology (the Playbook) and monitors impacts like avoided flood loss, social impact and restored biodiversity. 9 Alignment with the EPBC and Nature Positive Plan (2022) The project aligns with the existing EPBC Act as follows: • Marine and coastal ecosystem restoration: Restoration of oyster reefs, mangroves, and seagrass habitats supports the recovery of listed ecological communities. • Reduction of pollution and habitat degradation: Stormwater capture and treatment improves water quality flowing into Sydney Harbour, which also reduces pressures on marine biodiversity. • Consideration of heritage and cultural values: The project integrates both Aboriginal and post- colonial heritage to a global best practice standard. The project was specifically designed to align with the Nature Positive Plan and draft Nature Positive Act: • Restoration-focused outcomes: The project directly restores 3 hectares of mangroves, 2 hectares of wetlands, 2 km of oyster reef, and 2 hectares of canopy resulting in measurable \"nature positive\" gains. • Use of market-based incentives: The plan explores financing through blue carbon credits, nature repair markets, and biodiversity certification. • Commission visual artist working with ecology and plantings • Urban nature integration: Embedding ecological systems in transport, utilities, and housing infrastructure. Alignment with the National Housing Accord (2022) Our initial design work indicates a high probability that this project could provide considerable amounts of housing in one of the most desirable, and employment adjacent areas of urban Australia. It has the potential to: • Housing-enabling infrastructure: The plan proposes flood mitigation, utilities upgrades, and landform restoration that protect existing housing (150 homes) and the ability to unlock capacity for 2,000 new homes particularly on surplus government- owned land near transport nodes. • Precinct-level coordination: The plan provides the integrated governance critical to meeting Accord objectives. • Transit-oriented development (TOD) uplift: New high quality green space will enable density over Edgecliff and Kings Cross stations. • Place-based urban renewal: Our team includes many of Australia’s best known urban density experts, who can ensure the project delivers critically needed homes in an ecological and socially sustainable manner. Alignment with the National Agreement on Closing the Gap (2020) Our project supports the key reforms: • The project includes a First Nations Advisory Group and embeds First Nations leadership throughout. • It enables formal, paid partnerships with Traditional Owners, Aboriginal researchers and artists with an emphasis on bringing Aboriginal youth into opportunities and paid positions • Key decisions, such as site naming, land restoration, and heritage interpretation, are driven by the Elders and Saltwater Keepers. • Commissioning of Aboriginal-owned firms across all parts of the project, through storytelling, and cultural programming will contribute to a stronger community sector. • The plan restores natural systems and cultural significance, healing Sea Country and re-establishing traditional ecosystems like oyster reefs and wetlands. • Holds space for our partners to engage in truth telling in a place of national significance to First Nations Peoples historically and living urban Aboriginal culture today. Alignment with the National Active Transport Strategy (Draft) Our project aligns with its goals by: • Creating safe, connected active transport networks through the inclusion of bake paths with continuous foreshore access. • Integrated active transport networks with broader transport systems including bus, cycling, ferry and heavy rail. • A focus on wayfinding and nighttime safety especially for women, children and the aged. • Improved equity and accessibility of the active transport networks through a purposeful design which thoughtfully considers seniors, young children and the physically and mentally differently abled. Alignment with the National Sport Strategy 2024–2034 Finally, our plan aligns closely with the Sport Horizon policy by: • Participation: Encouraging more Australians to engage in sport and physical activity by creating flood free sporting facilities, connected urban walks in a great park setting. • Inclusion: Ensuring equitable access to sport across all of Rushcutters for all individuals, regardless of background or ability. • Economy and Environment: Leveraging sport to contribute to economic growth through two new harbour pools, a fit-for-purpose community sporting facility and enhanced marine sports facilities. 10 Revive: Australia’s National Cultural Policy (2023–2027) This project aligns with this act by providing a tangible model for how place-based, community-led cultural infrastructure can advance national priorities around inclusion, sustainability, and First Nations leadership. As a site of significant historical and cultural complexity, the precinct becomes a high-impact opportunity to demonstrate how culture can drive not only creative outcomes, but social, ecological, and economic transformation. Through a strategy that embeds artists, curators, and cultural practitioners from the outset, the project brings Revive’s five pillars to life at a precinct scale: • First Nations First by centring Aboriginal cultural knowledge through formal partnerships and self-determined practice. • A Place for Every Story by enabling diverse communities to contribute to the evolving identity of place. • The Centrality of the Artist by recognising artists as essential contributors to public life and urban development. • Strong Cultural Infrastructure through the development of scalable, place-responsive models for cultural delivery and governance. • Engaging the Audience via a participatory Living Lab program and community-driven activation strategy. National Medical Workforce Strategy (2021–2031) This precinct project supports the National Health Workforce Strategy by creating a healthier, more liveable urban environment which directly contributes to community health outcomes and attracts and retains a resilient local health workforce. It also creates opportunities for considerable amounts of key worker housing. It achieves this through: • Improves public health by delivering blue-green infrastructure that reduces heat, improves air and water quality, and builds climate resilience. • Supports social equity by protecting affordable housing and ensuring essential services are accessible to local residents and workers. • Strengthens system resilience by reducing disaster risks, easing future pressures on local health and emergency services. • Provides up to 500 key worker homes near Eastern City hospitals and aged care facilities, addressing the critical housing shortage for healthcare, emergency and other key workers. THRIVE 2030: The Re-Imagined Visitor Economy Strategy This project aligns with Thrive by creating sustainable, culturally rich, and accessible public spaces that enhance Sydney’s appeal as a visitor destination while benefiting local communities. It supports sustainable infrastructure, celebrates cultural diversity, addresses workforce and housing gaps, and stimulates economic growth through revitalised tourism and vibrant public amenity. • Strengthens sustainability and resilience: Delivers modern, climate- resilient infrastructure and nature- based coastal upgrades, aligning with THRIVE 2030’s goal for a sustainable and future-ready visitor economy. • Enhances the diversity and quality of visitor experiences: Showcases authentic local culture, arts, and First Nations heritage, meeting the Strategy’s priority for unique, inclusive experiences. • Grows the visitor economy responsibly: Activates new waterfront parks, active transport, marinas, and public amenities that attract more visitors while ensuring community benefit and place stewardship. • Builds resilient communities: Integrates tourism development with local wellbeing, protecting cultural assets and public spaces so the benefits of visitor spending uplift both community life and local businesses. • Activating natural heritage: Sydney Harbour is the State of NSW single most important tourism asset; this project considerably advances its appeal to both guests and locals. Net Zero 2050 under the Climate Change Act 2022 By prioritising nature-based, low- emissions urban regeneration and resilient infrastructure that reduces carbon and adapts to climate risks this project closely aligns with the 2050 goal. It supports national emissions targets while creating community and economic benefits through sustainable design and green innovation. • Reduces precinct-level carbon emissions through blue-green infrastructure and living shorelines. Mangroves and salt marsh are especially effective in this regards. • Supports renewable energy goals with sustainable utilities and low- impact marine services upgrades. • Encourages active transport networks, lowering transport emissions in the Eastern City. • Integrates circular economy principles and localised nature repair markets to store carbon and restore ecosystems. • Demonstrates a replicable model for climate-adapted urban precincts that contribute to national emissions reduction and resilience targets.

Surrounded by steep ridgelines and dense urban neighbourhoods, the bay is defined by its marina, parklands, and shoreline. Once a wetland fed by seasonal creeks, it now features seawalls, stormwater outlets and reclaimed land, with limited natural habitat remaining. Despite these changes, it retains ecological importance and offers public access to Sydney Harbour. Its layered history spans Gadigal traditional lands, early colonial industry, naval use, and modern recreation, making it a place of complex cultural and environmental significance. Sitting on the edge of the Sydney and Woollahra Councils Rushcutters Bay contains some of Sydney’s most beloved parklands. Complex overlays of planning controls and land management responsibilities have resulted in a fragmented and a disjointed mix of both exceptional and disappointing civil amenities. 13 Rushcutters Bay Project Site Sydney CBD Site definition The project site includes 53 ha of entirely government owned land beginning with Beare Park in Elizabeth Bay and proceeding along the bay to the tip of Yarranabbe Park. See Appendix N: Detailed site definition specific addresses. The government land managers are respectively. • NSW Crown Lands approx. 43 ha with responsibility delegated as follows: • 25 hectare of marine areas delegated to Transport for NSW Maritime • 10 hectare of parkland delegated to Woollahra Municipal Council. • 6 hectare of parkland delegated to the City of Sydney • 2 hectare of leases administered by NSW Crownland • Transport for NSW transport reserves and transport assets of approx. 8 ha • Sydney Water assets of approx. 2 ha Precolonial Rushcutters Bay Interpreted by consortium partner, Blue Green Rushcutters Park Yarranabbe Park Beare Park Elizabeth Bay Paddington Kings Cross Darling Point Edgecliff Pre-colonial History When the First Fleet arrived in 1788, Yarranabbe, now known by white Australia as Rushcutters Bay, was already a major Aboriginal settlement. For thousands of years prior, the Traditional Owners, the Gadigal of the Dharug language group, had maintained fishing, trapping and seasonal harvesting practices along these foreshores including carefully curated oyster reefs and wetlands. 14 Precolonial Rushcutters Bay Interpreted by consortium partner, Blue Green ‘Aboriginal Australians Night Fishing by Fire Torches' by Joseph Lycett 1817 National Library of Australia Fishing in nowies (bark canoes) by torch light highlights a radically difference relationship between the land, waters and its people its people than found in Rushcutters Bay today. The story of this community, once buried by time and aggressive land reclamation, is slowly resurfacing through the dedication of local Saltwater Knowledge Keepers and cultural practitioners, who continue to share and protect these coastal traditions. ‘Allotments of land at Yaranabee or Darling Point' by Edward J.H. Knapp Surveyor July 1856 National Library of Australia By the mid 1800’s the protective reefs and wetlands began to be removed. 15 Federation and between the wars The marshy \"Rush Cutting Bay\" remained semi-rural longer but as the area developed, it became a major source of fresh vegetables grown and harvested by early Chinese immigrant families. To commemorate Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee, the bay was reclaimed and formally dedicated as \"Rushcutters Bay Park\" in 1904. By the 1940s, the area had evolved to include manicured parks, a harbour pool, sports facilities, and the iconic Sydney Flying Squadron sailing club, which during the war became the Rushcutters Bay Naval Depot. The area’s legacy as a place of gathering and celebration continued with Sydney Stadium — built in 1908 and once the world’s largest roofed venue — hosting the historic 1908 Jack Johnson fight and later stars like Frank Sinatra and the Beatles, until its demolition in the 1970s for the Eastern Suburbs Railway and road widening. ‘Panorama of a tennis match at White City tennis courts, Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales, ca. 1940' by EB Studios National Library of Australia From between the wars Rushcutters Bay the cultural and sporting hub of the rapidly growing Australia. ‘Aerial View of Rushcutters Bay and Darling Point’ Unknown Photographer, Photograph. Circa 1940s State Library of New South Wales, Mitchell Library The historic harbour pool shown here was famously the first-place men and women swam together in the British Colonies. Colonisation and Transformation The story of Rushcutters Bay mirrored the story of Australia. Originally part of Governor Macquarie’s Domain for official use and grazing, the area was granted by Governor Darling in the 1820s to Colonial Secretary Alexander Macleay, who built Elizabeth Bay House in the 1830s and nearby Mona House. By the thriving Aboriginal settlement had evolved into a cluster of gunyahs, shelters constructed from slabs of wood, iron sheets, and other materials. Conflict with these Traditional Owners became common. This was the last home of the Gadigal on Country before they were forcibly relocated to La Perouse. This dispossessions began a dark chapter in our nation's history as one of the first acts of the NSW Aborigines Protection Board (established 1883). A beautiful but threatened place The city built around Sydney Harbour faces a perfect storm of rising sea levels, decaying grey infrastructure, and extreme flooding. Two hundred years of urban infrastructure development has disrupted natural water systems and removed protective ecosystems, leaving us disconnected from Country facing biodiversity loss, erosion, and increasing flood risk. As climate change intensifies, we risk losing our homes and precious parks, which are essential for a healthy, green, and connected city and its people. The parklands surrounding this bay includes critical cultural infrastructure such as the RANSA and CYCA Yacht Clubs, multiple sporting clubs and Critical Path’s choreographic studio. 16 Raw sewage flowing down from the combined stormwater drain in Elizabeth Bay in May 2025 A complex but increasingly less diverse economy In the last twenty years Rushcutters Bay and lower Paddington has become less commercially and socially diverse. However, pockets of thriving arts, culture and sports still exist, unsupported and arguably harmed by the existing road infrastructure, which sharply divided this previously connected neighbourhood. Health and Wellness Pets Hospitality Arts and Culture Marine Social services 4.2 Climate, nature, economic and social needs Climate & Nature The precinct faces severe climate risks, with rising seas and weather shifts threatening parklands and 150+ nearby homes and businesses, while biodiversity struggles to recover from two centuries of degradation. 17 Rushcutters Bay urgently needs coordinated precinct planning to address growing infrastructure, climate, and community pressures. Despite its national significance and proximity to the CBD, it has never had an integrated masterplan. Without action, fragmented governance and rising climate risks will define its future. Density & Diversity Minutes from the CBD, the precinct is crucial to easing the housing crisis but lacks services, green space, and affordable housing. Its key and creative workers commuting long distances undermining resilience and cultural vitality. Transport & Connection Transport in the precinct is outdated and disconnected, with few active links and an inaccessible foreshore. Rising sea levels and flooding further threaten key routes. With 20% population growth expected, major climate-resilient upgrades are essential. ‘Risks in Rushcutters' by consortium partner Blue Green What we lose Even in the face of the onrushing crisis we are paralysed in denial and divided. This will result in the loss of parkland, businesses and homes. It is not a question of if, but when. Sea level rise and extreme rain will compromise the parkland in Rushcutters Bay. Flooding will render many of the adjacent homes first uninsurable, then unbankable, then unliveable. We cannot accept this future as inevitable. 18 More than just a place If we lose our foreshore parklands, we lose much more than grass and trees. We lose the vital cultural connections which hold us together. Rushcutters Bay is a complex web of social and cultural institutions, from sports clubs, to dance studios to afternoon craft sessions for seniors and play dates in the park for our children. These institutions and daily events underpin our health and wellness as a society. We cannot accept their loss as inevitable. ‘Dog owners, plane trees, Rushcutters Bay' by Tom Carment Art Gallery of NSW Rushcutters Park is beloved by many, especially dogs and their owners. Everyone's problem and no one’s Fundamentally this grant is necessary to unlock this transformation. No single government department or private entity has the mandate or mechanism to coordinate a comprehensive plan. The barriers to regeneration and investment have not been financial, they have been institutional, regulatory, and structural. With an Investment Ready Precinct Plan there will be a case for change. With a feasible, viable and desirable plan the question becomes not why, but how and when. If de-risked this will become an undeniable opportunity for government. The need for a precinct scale response A precinct-scale intervention is essential because the challenges at Rushcutters Bay, ranging from climate exposure to fragmented governance, cannot be solved through isolated projects. Only a coordinated, place-based response can restore ecological function, enable resilient infrastructure, and unlock the areas full potential. This plan proposes a cohesive framework that aligns multiple layers of cultural, environmental, and urban renewal, bringing together a consortium of nationally recognised leaders in design, engineering, planning, policy, and First Nations engagement. Without a precinct lens, there is no mechanism to deliver the scale of transformation required: no pathway to safeguard existing homes, to enable new housing on government land, or restore the harbour’s ecological health. By coordinating investment in climate adaptation, green utilities, public realm upgrades and housing, an Investment Ready Precinct Plan can create a platform for future government, private and philanthropic capital. ‘Still Life and Rushcutters Bay' by Margaret Olley 1997 Art Gallery of NSW This is a place too important to Australia to lose. 19 The need for a unified voice A precinct-scale intervention is essential to address the challenges facing Rushcutters Bay. Our research, which includes structured interviews with 50 stakeholders across all tiers of government, shows that while there is strong support for change, and clear understanding of the triple crisis facing this place, no single organisation has the mandate to address these challenges. Management of the site is currently fragmented across 18 government departments. Although the entire project area is government-owned, no single department or agency has the authority or resources to initiate or deliver the comprehensive work needed at the precinct scale. Government land managers Government stakeholders A Catch 22 NSW State policy supports the resilient renewal of Rushcutters Bay—but cannot initiate it. There is an awareness that this precinct must change but cannot change under the current planning ecosystem. Although several planning approval pathways exist, none are accessible to the site’s fragmented land managers without foundational work: • A SEPP Amendment: A tailored State Environmental Planning Policy could unlock the precinct, but it would first require the evidence base and co- design process proposed in this grant. Recent examples include Barangaroo, Tech Central and Circular Quay. • A Precinct Authority: The NSW Premier’s Department could form a statutory authority to lead planning and delivery. However, without the design, engagement and cultural leadership provided by this project, such a move would be politically risky. Sydney Olympic Park is an example of the approval pathway. • Transfer to an Existing Agency: Crown land management could be reassigned to an agency such as Placemaking NSW or Greater Sydney Parklands. However, this would likely require Parliamentary approval, which is unlikely to proceed without a completed precinct plan. The Bays Precinct is an example of this pathway. The paradox for a partnership approach is clear: enabling these options depends on the very work this grant proposes. Until a precinct plan and governance pathway exist, the State cannot act. This gap is often filled by developers who initiate precincts for private benefit. There is no mechanism to originate such projects in the public interest. That’s why we propose a place-based public proponent (Section 5) and outline the Precinct 2.0 methodology (Section 6.3). Preliminary Investigation Like many grants, the uPPP asks applicants to outline both their approach to defining the problem and their proposed solution. It also requires alignment with program objectives and Australian Government priorities, which is difficult to demonstrate without an existing plan. To address this, we refer to our consortium partner, Blue Green’s initial investigation into the site.. It is critical to note that while this is “A Plan for Rushcutters” it is not “The Plan for Rushcutters” – that will emerge from the precinct planning process over the 14 months of this project. All elements of this plan are subject to change, expansion, or abandonment as the evidence base, technical studies and community-based research emerges. 20 An excerpts from VIVID A New Normal Exhibit “Slow Water, the Mangroves Return to Rushcutters” Delivered by consortium partner, Blue Green Inquiry by Design The initial concept for Healing Yarranabbe emerged through an iterative design process led by consortium member Colin Finn, developed in his PhD research at the University of Sydney using the Double Diamond model shown below. This design-led inquiry began with exploratory sketches and evolved rapidly through more than 15 iterations, incorporating feedback from technical experts, consultation with Traditional Owners, formal interviews with government stakeholders and narrative focused workshops with local community members. The resulting concept reflects a balance between community desire and technical feasibility, integrating ecological, cultural, and engineering considerations. Early financial modelling suggests the design could be carbon negative, nature positive and even revenue-positive for the State of NSW, provided suitable value capture mechanisms are implemented. 'Double Diamond Model' by British Design Council, 2005 This design method diverged as it explored the problem space, converged on a design with uPPP grant sought here funding a second more informed iteration. Section 5 Project Outcomes 5.1 How the precinct will deliver improvements and public benefits 21 Oyster reef as storm surge protection Oysters act as natural water filters and living seawalls, reducing pollution and buffering storm surge. Unlike concrete seawalls, oyster reefs adapt to rising seas and support marine biodiversity. In Sydney Harbour, their restoration is best paired with mangroves, saltmarsh and foreshore planting to address legacy pollution and to deliver full ecological viability and benefit. Elevated and floodable parkland Reshaping the foreshore with raised sandstone features, landscaped slopes, and floodable parklands can restore natural landforms, absorb stormwater, and create adaptable public spaces that safely handle occasional inundation, protecting nearby homes and reconnecting the landscape with its ecological and cultural roots. Living shorelines Replacing the existing hard concrete edges of the shorelines with naturalised landscapes, wetlands, and vegetated banks, could mitigate erosion, and support biodiversity. These softened features can integrate public paths, benches, and water access, creating spaces that are ecologically functional, climate-resilient, and welcoming for residents and tourists, restoring the harbour’s pre-colonial form. Daylighted streams Restoring the buried Boundary and Wests Creeks and Barcom Glen stream by naturalising Rushcutters Canal, could replace concrete drains with wider attractive waterways that reduce flood risk, filter pollution, support vegetation, and reconnect people with water. These waterways would cool the city, boost biodiversity, and intercept pollutants before they reach the harbour. Nature-based Solutions and hybrid infrastructure to mitigate climate risk An initial finding of this research indicated that integrated Nature-based Solutions could improve water quality, sequester carbon, reduce heat and flood risk, and restore biodiversity. It does this by returning renaturalised waterways, living shorelines, urban forests and soil remediation. Living infrastructure, and biophilic inspired hybrid green/grey infrastructure improvements can enhance ecological health, prevent contamination entering the harbour, mitigate climate impacts, and support a cleaner, safer, and more resilient Sydney Harbour. Evidence drawn from a review of fifty similar global projects documented that such an approach is practical and well understood from a technological perspective. Liveable, Equitable, Productive, Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure: These interventions align with the National Urban Policy (Draft 2024), Climate Resilience Strategy, Nature Positive Plan, National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy, Closing the Gap Agreement and Net Zero 2050 under the Climate Change Act 2022 . Healing Country The research found that once key risks are mitigated, a holistic regenerative design could restore ecological function along the harbour’s edge, reconnecting land and sea while reviving habitats, supporting food cultivation, and enabling species return. This regeneration blends bush care and science to boost biodiversity, strengthen resilience, and embed nature at the heart of community wellbeing. Mangroves & saltmarsh Once a defining coastal feature of Sydney, these complex intertidal ecosystems the research found that their restoration would improve ecological health while filtering toxins, stabilising shorelines, and storing vast amounts of carbon. Additionally, it would revive habitat for native species, generate biodiversity and sequester carbon, and reintroduce natural systems building resilience against climate risk and waterway degradation. Seagrass meadows Seagrass-friendly moorings and focused restoration can heal underwater ecosystems by preventing anchor scarring as well as stabilising the seabed, keeping legacy industrial and military pollution entombed. Species protection & re-introduction A powerful symbol of ecological reversal is possible here, restoring what was lost and rebalancing natural systems. The return of charismatic keystone species like black swans and little penguins could mark a shift from passive decline to active stewardship. An urban farm A large urban farm on the site of one of Sydney’s first market gardens could reconnect the precinct to its productive heritage and, together with a stormwater wetland, improves flood resilience and food security. 22 Liveable, Equitable, Productive, Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure: These interventions align with the National Urban Policy (Draft 2024), National Housing Accord, National Sport Strategy 2024–2034, National Active Transport Strategy (Draft), THRIVE 2030: The Reimagined Visitor Economy Strategy, National Health Workforce Strategy and Revive: Australia’s National Cultural Policy (2023–2027) The Arts, Sports, Tourism and Active Transport The design research identified that the precinct’s renewal requires weaving together arts, sport and tourism to create a vibrant and inclusive waterfront. It also found that to ensure the best pubic-good outcomes the precinct needs to be made accessible through safe and connected active transport networks. By creating new cultural spaces, upgrading sporting facilities, and connecting walking and cycling routes, the project could enable healthy lifestyles, play, creative expression, and economic vitality, transforming Rushcutters Bay into a dynamic and diverse destination. Reveal the layered history and stories of the place providing a richer lived experience for its residents while also enhancing tourism outcomes. Boardwalks and cycleways Creating a continuously connected foreshore unlocks safe, scenic routes from the eastern suburbs to the CBD. This could act as a vital link in Sydney’s cycleway network and will boost active transport, attract visitors, and support local businesses. Enhancing tourism and accessibility would increase economic vibrancy while celebrating the cultural and natural assets. A revitalised marina A transition to best practice sustainable marinas could help transition Sydney’s recreational fleet into electrification, reduce marine pollution and modernise the maritime services industry. Upgraded facilities would boost tourism, support major events like the Sydney to Hobart launch, and enhance and diversify community access. Harbour pools The bay once was home to iconic harbour baths, but these were dismantled in 1979 due to poor water quality. With improved water quality their restoration honours this legacy, offering inclusive recreation, supporting elite athletes, and promoting civic equity through renewed public access to the harbour. Community sports centre The research identified a need for a multi-purpose community sports centre combining essential grey infrastructure with social amenities. A multi-storey design could include a basement sewage pump and stormwater system, a ground-floor men’s shed, café, and kayak storage, and upper levels for indoor sports and rooftop soccer, supporting public health and local schools who have an urgent need for wet weather sporting facilities. Critical Transport Infrastructure and High-Density Resilient Housing Finally, the research found that by leveraging the natural, climate and social improvements of this precinct plan enables the integration of climate- resilient transport infrastructure with high-density housing to address Sydney’s housing crisis. Unlocking surplus government land near transport hubs, to create sustainable, inclusive, and future-ready urban living aligned with national and state priorities. Underground New South Head Road The research found that New South Head Road is highly climate-exposed and flooding already disrupts this arterial link to the city. A cut-and-cover solution would reduce flood risk, protect transport continuity, and unlock land above for housing and public use. The resulting economic uplift could offset infrastructure costs. Urban regeneration Transforming blighted urban areas along New South Head Road as well as the heavily polluted canal, would significantly boost property values, public amenity, and quality of life. Key worker creative worker housing Reclaiming the land currently occupied by New South Head Road unlocks government land which will have the capacity for up to 2,000 new homes. Initial modelling shows up to 50% could be essential and creative worker housing while remaining economically viable. Urban reconnection Privatised foreshore access and New South Head Road have fractured the urban fabric between Elizabeth Bay, Rushcutters Bay, and Paddington. A design investigation of repairing those disconnections, reveals an unbroken cultural ribbon and blue- green grid, creating a continuous, high-quality urban precinct. 5.2 Culture as Catalyst for Resiliency and Renewal Cultural Ecology Culture is central to the health and vitality of the precinct. An inclusive, evolving cultural framework needs to be established that can grow and transform in symbiosis with the ecological, social and economic ecosystems. It can foster ceremony, celebration, civic dialogue, play, and experimentation. It could guide temporary programs and permanent commissions, as well as curatorial platforms that grow with the precinct over time. A precinct plan holds the potential to enable truth-telling, cultural activation, and deep community belonging as key urban outcomes. This is not just about acknowledging history; it ensures that arts and culture actively shape the precinct’s future form and civic life. Culture as Methodology Culture, the Arts and activation of heritage in this precinct could extend well beyond an afterthought and instead drive the heart of the project methodology. Arts and culture are vehicles for truth-telling, participation, and urban imagination. From temporary activations to long-term civic infrastructure, cultural strategy is embedded as a means of deepening connection to place, surfacing under- represented narratives, and strengthening social cohesion. Cultural Context The precinct sits on the doorstep of one of Australia’s most densely concentrated creative corridors, a nationally significant cluster of commercial galleries, independent studios, and arts institutions that stretches from Paddington through Darlinghurst and into the city. This “eastern cultural spine” plays a vital role in Australia’s arts ecology, offering artists from across the country pathways to critical recognition, representation, and public engagement. The proximity of Rushcutters Bay to this hub presents a unique opportunity: to extend cultural activity eastward into public space, expand participation beyond traditional institutions, and connect new audiences with contemporary creative practice. The site contains a rich tapestry of First Nations continuing histories, colonial heritage and contemporary visual and performing arts organisations that are active and widely respected. These require recognition, restoring, and further enhancement and offer a strong foundation from which to build. ‘Future Memory Pavilion' by Pernilla Ohrstedt and Asif Khan 2011 Royal Academy of Arts, Singapore Curated by consortium partner Kate Goodwin, this piece revealed little known histories of a place, connecting past, present, and future. This project can strengthen Sydney’s cultural infrastructure, not through standalone venues, but through embedded, civic, and community-led cultural life. It becomes a bridge between professional and public practice, between artist and audience, and between local knowledge and national significance. By embedding culture at its core, the plan ensures the precinct is not only seen, but felt, shared and sustained. 23 ‘Entangled (Kogerah Scheming)’ Performed by Lian Loke, Ira Ferris, Gideon Payten-Griffiths At Critical Path Drill Hall Studio, Rushcutters Bay (shown here in rehearsal at Readymade Works studio in Ultimo) The Arts can bring life and heart to the polycrisis which demands that the world, and the ways we make our place within it, transform, like it or not. 5.3 Outcomes Overview of potential benefits Our initial investigations noted that while comprehensive technical studies (enabled through this grant) are needed to fully assess outcomes, preliminary design analysis indicates the project is likely to deliver up to twenty significant positive impacts across environmental, social, economic, and cultural domains. 24 Parramatta River Boardwalk Delivered by consortium partners, Hills Thalis Nature & Climate infrastructure Cultural & Social infrastructure Transport infrastructure Utilities infrastructure An Investment Ready Precinct Plan which is Feasible, Viable and Desirable Liveable Equitable Productive Sustainable Resilient 5.

These align with the goals of the National Urban Policy. Possible quantum of benefits identified in the initial inquiry • 150 homes protected and re-insurable • Risk mitigation reduction for 150 more • Approximately 2,000 new homes on NSW State Government land • Supports over $3B in adjacent uplift over nearby Trasport Orientated Density zones • Enhanced tourism revenue • 3 ha of restored mangroves • 2 ha of restored wetlands • 2 ha of restored canopy • Arts and Heritage activation connecting the cultural ribbon across Sydney • Clean ecologically restored harbour • Reconnection to Country 25 Establishing the rationale for the inclusion of elements in the precinct, linking place with purpose Precinct creation within the inner- urban core of Sydney has in the past been highly contentious, often spilling over into the political, media and social arenas, dividing rather than uniting Sydneysiders. To ensure that the Rushcutters Bay Precinct Plan responds to the true underlying barriers to regeneration, we will convene a series of targeted roundtables in partnership with our university collaborators, including the University of Sydney, UNSW and UTS. These roundtables will bring together leading academics, government, local experts, and community to map and clarify the complex social, ecological, environmental, economic, and governance challenges that have historically hindered coordinated urban renewal in this part of Sydney. This process will distil clear, evidence- based problem statements to underpin the precinct plan’s priorities and design responses. By grounding our approach in rigorous academic insight and collaborative inquiry, we aim to build a robust case for change that aligns with best practice, ensures policy relevance, and supports long- term, place-based transformation. This clear problem framing will inform the governance of the project as we seek to answer these questions in an action research methodology. Following their initial findings the roundtable participants become a panel the studio and workstreams can use for expert advice. 5.4 Convening Academic Roundtables to Define Precinct Challenges – Learning Collective Partners in this inquiry We have invited these groups to help explore these key questions. • Governance: What planning and governance model is most likely to succeed in delivering and managing the precinct’s complex, cross- jurisdictional regeneration? • Climate Change: What evidence- based climate projections can best inform how sea level rise, flooding, drought, heat and storm impacts will affect Sydney Harbour? • Social Equity and Inclusion: How can the Rushcutters Bay Precinct be designed to ensure equitable outcomes, protect vulnerable groups, and prevent displacement or unintended social harm? • Cultural Ribbon and 24-Hour Economy: How can urban design and cultural strategies reconnect the eastern city’s cultural ribbon and support a thriving, inclusive 24- hour economy? • Biodiversity and Healing Country: What practical and culturally informed actions will most effectively reverse biodiversity loss and heal Country in and around Rushcutters Bay? • Value Capture: How can the social, cultural, and economic value created be effectively captured and reinvested to fund its delivery and stewardship? Letters of support from these partners can be found in Appendix X from page X to X. Each round table will be supported by a member of our First Nations Advisory team, see section X page Y.

The project’s potentials extend beyond site boundaries, with Rushcutters Bay as the centre of a greater catchment, physically, operationally and culturally. Its possibilities are framed as site strategies across a range of categories: Landform and Water, Ecologies and Habitats, Culture and Activation and Governance and Stewardship. The outcomes illustrate ways in which the objectives of the place plan will manifest genuine benefits beyond the precinct, for Country, for the city and for all its constituents. 5.5 Future opportunities this project unlocks Landform and Water The restoration of an operative topography is expressed through the gatherings of water, rediscovering processes of Country, and reinforcing them with a site-wide, water positive hydrological ecosystem. This rebuilds the Ecological Capital of the precinct with impacts which effect the entire catchment and cool the entire city. 1. Former creeks, riparian corridors, natural catchments and wetlands are reconnected to Yarranabbe through overland flow paths, creek renaturalisation and engineered water events. 2. The monocultural infrastructure of seawalls and drainage channels are reformed into a diverse, borderless landscape to manage rising sea levels, flooding and storm surge: berms, dunes, saltmarsh and wetlands. 3. Rainwater, stormwater and wastewater is harvested, stored, treated and re-used throughout in an integrated water management system, for both buildings and landscape: irrigation, production, maintenance, potable water and play, benefiting the entire catchment. 27 Rushcutters Connection and Conflict Photo by consortium partner, Robin Wyatt Photography Ecologies and Habitats Natural environments are protected, improved and restored across the precinct, connected to larger surrounding ecologies, and interlinked throughout the precinct with activity and event spaces that are integrated within this green network. Natural Capital becomes a living asset of the city and meaningfully improves the lives of those who call it home. 1. A continuous bio-corridor is established across the entire precinct, re-linking the hilly landscapes of Paddington with the foreshore wetlands of the Harbour, re-establishing habitat diversity. This closes a key gap in the blue green grid across Sydney. 2. Native landscapes and endemic planting are restored: tree canopy reconnected, fields returned to wetlands, salt marsh, mangroves and oyster reefs creating a living foreshore, and restoring Country. 3. From Darling Point to Boundary Street, Trumper Park to Garden Island, managed ecotopes are introduced, dense aggregations of soils, plants and animals integrated into the urban fabric of the precinct. An archipelago of green spaces: endemic habitats, curated gardens, and productive growing spaces (greenhouses, farms and orchards). Culture and Economics The land-use scenarios established at Rushcutters Bay will provide a framework for the evolution of a fully sustainable community across the city. Individual initiatives contribute returns, reinvestment, demographics and infrastructure, leading to self-funding scenarios for the precinct, connecting it to nearby economies and activities. 1. Development projects respond to existing and emerging market demands, while providing secondary assets to the precinct: environmental restoration, civic amenity, local connectivity and an increased diversity of inhabitants and activities. 2. Spatial offerings are distributed throughout, at diverse scales and varied typologies, ranging from large maker spaces and warehouse-style venues to courtyard and street-oriented sites to small scale and migratory spaces distributed across the precinct. 3. Community infrastructure will be integrated throughout the precinct, with a range of programs taking advantage of the diversity of buildings and spaces to provide theatres, meeting rooms, halls, workshops, classrooms and event spaces. 28 Sustainability and Stewardship Rushcutters Bay will be an exemplar of a fully sustainable community: cultural policies, economic strategies and infrastructure systems will be fully integrated to make the precinct resilient in terms of physical resources, investment, social organisation, inclusion and participation. This builds the Community Capital across the city. 1. There is no sustainability without re-integration, and there is no better model for humanity in balance with living systems than Australia’s First Peoples. Founding the precinct on Designing with Country, Indigenous voices, local Aboriginal communities and the place itself – this is the core approach to sustainability at Rushcutters Bay. 2. Carbon neutrality is the default starting point. Beyond this, the precinct will be net zero over whole-of-life, a carbon sink, achieve net-zero waste circularity, recycle and reuse buildings and materials, increase habitats and bio-diversity, support health and well-being locally. It will be an exemplar of the kind of change we can make in our urban places. 3. The precinct will become an engine for a regenerative future, one that restores and enhances the relationships between human systems and the natural world around us. Wagonga Inlet Living Shoreline NSW Coastal Design Guidelines example delivered consortium partner, Tom Rivard (and author of these images) 29 Connecting with Country This is not a step in a process – it is the process. This project aims to deliver a greater best practice standard and protocol for designing with Country by partnering with Indigenous leaders and experts across the consortium team to foster better two-way processes with and outcomes for Country – including Aboriginal people. Led by First Nations partners, the studio process of this precinct plan is a relational and reciprocal process that centres First Nations people as Cultural authorities and Country as an active collaborator. It moves beyond consultation to embed Country at the heart of design, guided by First Nations Law, Knowledges, protocols and responsibilities. This approach honours generational knowledge, respects cultural protocols, and ensures benefits flow back to community. Led by First Nations, this Country-centred Design approach allows design and planning to be grounded in place, purpose and ethical relationships over time. The first step of the process is to resource an Aboriginal Community Committee – a self-determined First Nations forum to articulate the vision, aspirations, governance and approach to guide the plan. Aspirations for Country First Nations aspirations will guide the process and plan. While this will be developed in the first step of the process, several local priorities identified in the First Peoples Dialogue Forum (City of Sydney) guided by consortium partner David Beaumont that this process will uphold include: • Aboriginal cultural authority in governance and decision-making • Youth formally represented • Bringing Aboriginal concepts into planning and development • Bringing physical and cultural assets back to Aboriginal control • Healing Country, including giving voice back to water, doing no more harm and climate action • Truth telling initiatives, including sharing language • Financial security for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people • Local and affordable home ownership for Aboriginal people • Community cultural and artistic spaces • Continuing connection to Country and having an ‘Eorean’ identity in Sydney • Community defining and measuring what success is • Revitalised cultural spaces and places bringing culture and history into the present 5.6 Connecting with Country and Designing With Country Gosford Leagues Club Park Delivered by consortium partners, Turf Design Studio and GML Heritage 30 'Hierarchical approach to Relational approach’ The work of Steffan Lehmann and Dillon Kombumerri Redrawn by consortium partner Dr Danièle Hromek Engaging-With-Country, Djinjama Cultural Design & Research, 2020 ‘Possible alternative planning process’ Created by consortium partner Dr Danièle Hromek Indigenous Interpretation Strategy, 2020 Country-centred Design Approach This approach places Country at the centre of planning, design and environmental management, shifting away from anthropocentric worldviews toward Country-centric governance. It is a shift from top-down imposition to grounded collaboration, where site boundaries expand to encompass cultural landscapes, storylines, and ecological systems. It calls for ethical and enduring relationships with Country, and with First Peoples as its true custodians. First Nations partners will lead these processes, not as stakeholders but as hosts. Together we co-create environments that heal, hold memory, and offer futures grounded in justice, sustainability and belonging for all who now share Country. This approach is built on the following which are a short summary of working principles developed through the research and design work of consortium partner Dr Danièle Hromek (Yuin): • Start with Country recognising Country is living and sentient, one that holds Law, memory, knowledge and spirit and beginning the process with a strong understanding of the place and what it needs. • Deep listening the act of ‘dadirri’ – listening beyond the ears and into the whole being. Connecting with Country through a deliberate and repeated practice of learning through movement, of coming into relationship with place by being in and with it. • Reading Country giving authority to First Nations Knowledge Holders as the true knowers, interpreters and guiders of Country and gaining a deeper and more holistic understanding of place. This is also about ensuring the cultural safety of Knowledge Holders and protecting ICIP throughout the process. • Country as first client prioritising Country to enable a process that fosters healing, continuity and collective care. It will ensure deep structural stewardship, with projects grounded in cultural integrity, ecological balance, and a future shared with Country, not just built upon it. • (Re)generate do no more harm by acknowledging colonial harm to Country and its people, redressing harmful practices, actions and outcomes and prioritising the sacredness and health of Country. • Learn, Unlearn, Relearn designing with humility, open-mindedness and equity by placing spatial and social justice at the heart to ensure that everyone has a place to live and flourish together and nobody is left behind. • Masterplanning with Country developing complementary design that speaks to and with Country and is of its place. This incorporates planning for all aspects of Country including non-physical such as Cultural practices and caring for Country responsibilities. 31 'Country and the Built Environment’ by consortium partner Dr Danièle Hromek Engaging-With-Country, Djinjama Cultural Design & Research, 2020 Respectfully engaging with Country requires reflection on our position with the relationships between land, more-than-humans and people.

Section 6 Community engagement, collaboration and partnership 6.1 Partnership and engagement model Precinct Planning 2.0 The partnership model proposed for the Rushcutters Bay precinct planning process adapts principles from the collective impact framework to guide an inclusive and regenerative approach to master planning. While the academic literature does not yet define this hybrid methodology, it can be understood as a form of “collective precinct planning” or “regenerative master planning.” Within the project team, this approach has come to be referred to as “Precinct Planning 2.0,” reflecting its commitment to more collaborative, less hierarchical design processes that amplify diverse voices and improve urban outcomes. In applying this model, the project draws on the “constellation model” of governance from the collective impact literature. This provides a flexible, non- linear structure suited to the complexity of this site, enabling dynamic partnerships that can respond to evolving needs while maintaining shared strategic direction. 33 Precolonial Rushcutters Bay Interpreted by consortium partner, Blue Green Scoping governance needs The governance of the Rushcutters Bay project is evolving as the work to manifest a new precinct plan matures. In the preliminary ‘building readiness’ phase the project has adopted the four voices of design framework for capturing the partners that are needed to move the precinct forward. The community of intent governing has been the project group. That community is now widening and inviting other organisations/voices into the project. This creates a need to develop the next iteration of the partnership and governance model. The audience for this model is the grant provider, and the level of work needed for them should be set at the ‘good enough’ point. This will allow the model to be refined and modified in line with what emerges with our stakeholders in the visioning and early planning stages of the project. At that later stage, it will be useful to understand which decisions have to be made at which point in the project and who should make them. This will involve mapping the project life cycle to identify decision points in each cluster/constellation and then applying a RACI model. The Friends of Rushcutters meet in the park Convened by consortium partner, Yvonne Pinniger ‘The Collective Impact Model' by John Kania and Mark Kramer Stanford Social Innovation Review This model is seeing increasing use in the Australian social and clmate impact ecosystem. 34 The Four Voices Model of Ecosystem Change Design by consortium partner, Bill Bannear of ThinkPlace Who do we need to bring together to create a viable Investment Ready Precinct Plan? Creating a shared agenda This grant will enable a comprehensive master planning process that, when viewed through a collective impact lens, begins with developing a shared agenda among project partners and the broader community of stakeholders. This collaborative foundation ensures alignment across diverse interests and creates the conditions for long-term, place-based change. Six functions have been identified that facilitate the work of the project: 1. Place and community, who constitute the client for the project. 2. A board or stewardship group with delegated decision-making powers. 3. A central secretariat or backbone function. 4. A studio of urban design and architects. 5. Technical working groups informing precinct design. 6. A panel of subject matter experts who can be called on for specific guidance and advice. Once the community has co-defined the project objectives, the communities of practice will be established around each objective. Each will be convened by a lead organisation or individual and supported by a collaborative network of stakeholders. The nature of each objective will determine the composition and level of involvement of the core project functions within each community of practice. The Voice of Intent: A key innovation of Precinct Planning 2.0 is having the voice of intent be the Place itself. It is represented by the board or stewardship group who acts as the project sponsor. On a day-to-day basis this is undertaken by the secretariat who report to the stewardship group. The Voice of Experience: Emerges from the community, business and government partners invited into the project. Their lived experience is critical for ensuring a desirable project. The Voice of Design: Is represented by the team who facilitates the partnerships, guides the project and explores how the project sits within the urban, natural and social context. Additionally, our academic partners provide guidance through roundtables and provision of advice through the expert panels. The Voice of Capability: These are the architects, designers, engineers and the many subject matter experts required to design a significant urban place. Engagement and Impact Responsible for managing engagement activities with the community and key stakeholders. This team includes the economic team members, embedding social, economic and environmental inquiry in the heart of the project. Technical Workstreams To support the work of the studio, informed by the engagement and impact teams we have assembled deep capability across the technical disciplines. Partnership structure visualised A Constellation Governance Ecosystem provides us a partnership architecture for Place-Based Regeneration. Designing with Country is embedded in every part of this structure. 35 Stewardship Group This group provides the authority to the project to form intent on behalf of people and place. It is the voice of people and place, comprising representatives of local interests with community standing (government, First Nations, community groups) alongside project leaders. The stewardship group would have delegated authority to make key design decisions in the interests of people and place, driven by codesign with community, stakeholders and experts. Secretariat Serving as the backbone of the project, guided by the Stewardship Group. Its functions include project leadership and management, coordination, administration and budget management. The secretariat will also manage documentation and accountability for the grant funding. Studio Nine of Australia’s most talented designers and architects, and backed by their teams, is responsible for translating the aspirations and context of people and place into feasible, viable and desirable concepts for the future of Rushcutters Bay. They will form a temporary collaborative studio for the duration of the project, working out of a co-design space in a warehouse space within the precinct itself. Documentation & Communication The design and communications team works with the studio to turn concepts into a viable, possible and investment- ready precinct plan.. Heritage, Arts, Play & Sports To support the work of the studio, to activate culture, restore heritage, enable play, deepen connection, spark belonging, and embedded in the community-led cultural infrastructure of this place. Academic Roundtables A series of roundtables will activate expert partners and stakeholders early in the life of the project. This will allow us to draw on local and national expertise and academic and other networks to strengthen the overall approach.

Recognising that the complexity of this place exceeds the remit of any single authority, the model embraces boundary-spanning governance, moving beyond traditional organisational silos and enabling collaboration across governments, communities, businesses, universities, and knowledge holders. 'Co-creating a regenerative future for Sydney' by Regen Sydney Regen Sydney is a network of organisations & individuals exploring a regenerative future for Sydney. We are collaborating across silos and sectors - building the social infrastructure needed to bring Sydney into the safe and just space. 37 Principles of Collaborative Governance This approach draws on principles of Collective Impact and regenerative systems thinking to support a long-term, shared agenda. Our governance model is underpinned by these commitments which form is partnership policy: • Equity and Inclusion: We will actively court diversity, recognising the unique value that citizen leaders, community members, and Traditional Owners bring to decision-making. These groups offer local context, lived experience, and knowledge that institutional stakeholders and designers may not possess. • Power for Purpose: The governance structure is designed to navigate the power base of government and institutional actors while ensuring that power is used in service of shared goals. Roles, responsibilities, and decision-making authority are clearly defined and transparently communicated. • Decision Design: Early in the process, we will co-design decision-making protocols that clarify the scope and limits of authority across the project’s working groups, the Stewardship Group, and the wider community partnerships. • Integrity and Accountability: All partners, government, community, and private, are held to consistent standards of transparency, communication, and participation. Clarity around expectations ensures trust and delivery of shared outcomes. • Conflict Resolution: Mechanisms will be put in place early to surface and resolve conflicts in equitable, timely, and transparent ways. These pathways will be accessible to all participants. Regen Waiverly Convened by consortium partner, Regen Sydney • Cultural Intention: Culture is built intentionally through shared behaviours. Leadership across the partnership is supported to uphold principles of respect, learning, and reciprocity. How we work together is as important as what we deliver. • First Nations Cultural Authority: First Nations partners will shape how Country is understood, respected, and restored. Their role is not advisory, but authoritative within the precinct’s cultural, environmental and historical context. We commit to processes that support First Nations-led decision- making and uphold the principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent. • Cultural Safety and Reciprocity: Our partnership process prioritises cultural safety and long-term relationship- building over transactional engagement. • Local Relevance: Governance structures, rules, and processes will be tailored to local needs and conditions. While informed by best practice, they are grounded in the specific realities of Rushcutters Bay. • Community Voice: Community voice is embedded across all levels of governance, not limited to formal representation. We design for active, iterative feedback and ensure those impacted by decisions have the opportunity to shape them. • Continuous Learning: Successes and setbacks are both sources of learning. The governance approach includes processes to review, reflect and improve throughout the life of the project. • Protecting Decision-Making Rights: Governance agreements will explicitly recognise and protect the decision- making rights of local communities and ensure external authorities respect autonomy of the collaborative process. • Structured Decision-Making: The Stewardship Group, comprising representatives from government, First Nations, community, and technical partners has delegated decision- making authority. The Secretariat supports this group by coordinating agendas, maintaining documentation, and ensuring accountability. • Distributed Governance: The project adopts a Constellation Governance Model. Each domain (e.g. nature, transport, housing, culture) is coordinated by a Cluster Lead, who facilitates co-design, consolidates input, and presents recommendations to the Stewardship Group for decision. • Clear Roles and Authority: Decision- making authority is allocated through a documented RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) framework. This defines who leads, who approves, who must be consulted, and who is kept informed— minimising duplication and delays. • Transparency and Accountability: Major decisions are recorded, published, and reviewed. Project milestones, risks, and conflicts of interest are reported via quarterly governance updates. Conflict resolution protocols are in place to ensure issues are resolved equitably and efficiently. 38 Discussing ideas with exhibition attendees at the Drill Hall, Rushcutters Bay. Delivered by consortium partner, Colin Finn of Blue Green 6.3 Engagement to date As part of the developing, multi-layered community engagement strategy, we have outlined 5 key community engagement types. The initial focus has and will continue to be informing, connecting and co-creating with the community to build awareness, connection and community ownership during the duration of the project. Once the plan is developed, community engagement continues and becomes a range of buzzing pop-ups where school groups, community groups and volunteers come together implementing and stewarding the local precinct plan.

Engagement from here With funding enabled by the uPPP grant, the partnership will refine design options, confirm governance, and prepare for community engagement focused on ongoing co-design, co-delivery and long-term stewardship. Engagement will follow IAP2 principles, ensuring transparent, inclusive and responsive processes from early design through to implementation. Community input will shape priorities, with clear reporting back on how decisions reflect local contributions. Co-design workshops, public exhibitions and targeted roundtables will maintain broad involvement, while technical groups resolve transport, housing, climate resilience and public realm details. A suite of first moves, easy wins and early activations will deliver quick, visible benefits, including pilot projects, prototype upgrades and low-cost improvements that build confidence and momentum. As part of the investment and staging plan, a detailed strategic community engagement plan will be developed to guide the transition into delivery and ensure continued community leadership and stewardship, as detailed in section 5.3. 41 Gosford Leagues Club Park Delivered by consortium partners, Turf Design Studio and GML Heritage To date, all project planning and development has been contributed on a volunteer basis. The grant investment in this plan will resource a formalised self-determined process and Aboriginal leadership and partnership throughout the process. This multi-layered strategy is focused on developing existing relationships with local Aboriginal people, engaging with and strengthening work being undertaken in the area across engagement, research and caring for Country, and prioritizing and resourcing self-determined priorities for Country and community. Leadership Partnership Knowledges Strengthening Custodianship Nurturing relationships with community and cultivating a self-determined approach to guide the project Funded ongoing engagement with Elders, community, Land Councils and First Nations organisations developing a self- determined approach to engagement and participation including a vision and benefits for Country and community.

Grounded in the IAP2 spectrum, our approach evolves from informing with clear, accessible content through to empowering communities in decision- making. We will: • Inform with clear, balanced and accessible information • Consult by actively listening to community feedback • Involve stakeholders early to shape outcomes • Collaborate with communities to develop solutions together • Empower by embedding community leadership in decision-making In the first stages of the project, we will develop a detailed Community and Stakeholder Engagement Strategy, mapping key groups and defining tailored engagement levels. By meeting people where they are and bringing them on the journey, we ensure local knowledge informs every stage of planning and design. Partner community risk management This precinct has long been seen as high-risk by land managers, given its complex governance and a fractured, active, and at times litigious community. With Regen Sydney, a trusted, community-focused non-profit as lead and applying best-practice IAP2-aligned engagement, we provide a neutral, socially safe platform for collaboration. To support this, the consortium includes PR, branding and strategic comms experts to ensure clear, plain language, public-good-focused messaging. The project’s academic framing and Playbook reinforce that this is a scalable, public-interest initiative, not a developer-led proposal. This approach de-risks participation, avoids over promising, and manages expectations transparently enabling all partners to co-create outcomes none could deliver alone Section 7 Capacity, capability and resources to deliver the project 7.1 Consortium The Rushcutters Bay Precinct Plan will be delivered by a multidisciplinary team with a proven track record in managing complex urban projects at the intersection of design, governance, and community-led transformation.

It leverages both the extensive experience of the architects and designers of the Studio with the well-defined engagement strategies of our conveners. Grounded in regenerative design and community-led planning, the approach brings together governments, First Nations, community, and industry partners to co-create an Investment Ready Precinct Plan that addresses complex urban challenges through a truly integrated, place-based approach. The process is delivered through a staged structure from initiation and site analysis through to co-design, costing and finalisation, supported by dedicated workstreams in design, ecology, infrastructure, community, and governance. These phases are entirely linear, but iterative, allowing for reflection, testing, and adaptation. 54 Sydney Harbourside Cockle Bay Designed by consortium partners, Djinjama (Concept Design) and Henning Larsen (Masterplan) Wagonga Inlet Living Shoreline Design delivered consortium partners, Tom Rivard, Short Pants Consulting and Moffat & Nichol Critically, the methodology ensures that the project is guided by its shared agenda, developed through early and ongoing co-design with a broad coalition of partners and stakeholders. This foundation ensures alignment across diverse interests and sets the conditions for feasible, viable and desirable, place-based precinct plan. The methodology is enacted through six key functions: the voice of place and community; a stewardship group with delegated authority; a secretariat providing backbone coordination; a multidisciplinary design studio; technical working groups; and panels of subject matter experts. Together, these actors form a dynamic ecosystem of collaboration structured enough to deliver, flexible enough to evolve. This integrated model ensures the plan is not only technically robust, but economically, environmentally and socially legitimate and locally loved. Section 8: Project Plan 8.2 Methodology Overview – Precinct Planning 2.0 We’ve taken to referring to our approach as Precinct Planning 2.0. We see this project as proving an improved way to bring together diverse interests for the public good of place. In essence our approach means the creation of a temporary institution to hold the interests of place – a trusted space for connection and discourse, to work through tensions and deliver value on many fronts – not just dominant commercial or political voices. Stewardship Group Prior design inquiry Project Initiation Roundtables Listening to Place and People Convening the Community of Intent Concept Design & Co-Authoring Iterative-Design Living Lab Design Development Staging & Costing Final Investment Ready Precinct Plan The stewardship group establishes the project with the voice of place at the centre, with community standing Roundtables activate expertise around important themes, attracting interest and energy Convening the community of intent opens the design to a wide range of the community The living lab enables the community to test the concept and ideas and refine them The approach supports wide- spread support across the interests of place Existing work allows us to start with a strong hypothesis and provocation Roundtables net new inputs, thinking and opportunities Inquiry in workstreams provides additional evidence into opportunities and constraints Collaboration and iteration between community and studio experts generates powerful and pragmatic concept Detailed analysis, development, planning and costing delivers a viable precinct plan Testing with experts and community refines the design As part of our approach, we intend to develop and capture the methodology and learning for reuse across Australia, to shift planning processes in favour of authentic codesign and a more holistic approach to value creation (ecological, commercial, social, economic, wellbeing). Precinct Planning 2.0 emphasises relationships and reconnection: of ecology, of community and of physical environment. 5556 8.3 Detailed Methodology 1 2 3a 3b Project Initiation Roundtables Site Investigation Convening the Community of Intent Co-Authoring Start by setting up the project team, governance structure, and working relationships. Confirm who is involved, what their roles are, and how decisions will be made. This includes creating the Steering Committee, defining project goals, and agreeing on shared principles like equity, transparency and respect for Country. This phase sets the tone for the whole project at the very beginning to ensure everyone is working towards the same outcomes. Deliverable: Project Management Plan (PMP) Convene academic and expert roundtables to define the problem space . Rigorously frame the core urban, ecological, social, and economic challenges – the wicked problems which inhibit the success of the precinct. Translate complex, overlapping issues into clear, solvable problem statements that guide the precinct’s design logic, innovation priorities, and long-term resilience objectives. Gather a deep understanding of the site, its history, challenges, and potential. This includes on-Country engagement, historical research, environmental surveys, and local storytelling. First Nations voices, local knowledge, first contract engagement, and technical experts will all contribute to understanding how the land has changed and what risks need to be addressed. This ensures that the design is grounded in what the place truly needs, culturally, environmentally, and socially. This phase initiates foundational site investigations, including hydrological modelling, geotechnical assessments, and infrastructure audits. Engineers, planners, and ecologists collaborate to identify flood vulnerabilities, service constraints, and soil conditions, while mapping existing utilities and transport networks. Both technical findings are integrated with cultural and ecological values to inform spatial constraints and design opportunities. This evidence base ensures that future design interventions are both physically feasible and aligned with broader climate resilience and urban systems performance. Deliverable: Opportunities & Constraints Report and Place Design Brief This stage focuses on identifying, engaging, and bringing together the diverse groups who hold a stake in the future of Rushcutters Bay. This includes residents, landholders, cultural institutions, sporting clubs, marine businesses, service providers, and Traditional Owners. The respective workstreams will undertake targeted outreach and hold a series of structured engagement activities, such as listening sessions, community forums, design charrettes, and cultural engagement events to understand shared values, surface tensions, and gather local knowledge. This process builds a trusted co- design environment where lived experience, expert insight, and policy priorities can intersect. The outcome is not just a list of stakeholders, but the formation of a “Community of Intent” a committed, place-based partnership that holds both interest in, and influence over, the precinct’s future. This group becomes an active co-author of the precinct plan. Youth Workshop Bellingen, Dorrigo & Urunga CBD Master Plans Led consortium partners, Cobalt Engagement Work to shape a shared vision for the future of Rushcutters Bay. This means turning local stories, aspirations and technical knowledge into a unifying narrative that can guide decision- making. The vision will connect practical needs (like housing and transport) with deeper values (like Healing Country and strengthening culture). Deliverable: Shared vision report This story becomes the foundation for design, ensuring the precinct remains meaningful and inclusive. Preparation of sketch precinct-scale designs by the urban design team, integrating spatial analysis, land use, and preliminary massing studies. The Studio designers will test layout options against planning controls, infrastructure capacity, climate risk data, and movement networks. Working closely with engineers, ecologists, and cultural advisors, the team will translate strategic objectives into a spatial framework that balances density, connectivity, public realm, and environmental performance. Deliverable: Sketch Concept Design with the community and partners 57 4 5 6 7 Concept Design Iterative-Design Living Lab Design Development This stage brings together urban designers, engineers, ecologists, cultural strategists, artists, and social researchers in a collaborative design process led by the Studio. Collectively, the team will interpret technical studies and community insights into spatial strategies that balance infrastructure needs with cultural and environmental values resulting into refined conceptual layouts and early sketches of sub- precinct plans. Simultaneously, the branding and communications workstream specialists explore identity, tone, and public perception, shaping how the precinct will be understood and experienced. Additionally, led by the social scientists at ThinkPlace the engagement specialists test design assumptions with focused user groups, ensuring proposed interventions reflect real behaviours, access patterns, and social diversity. Through this integrated approach, concept design becomes both a creative and analytical exercise in systems thinking and cultural translation. Deliverable: Draft Concept Design Co-design is the heart of the participatory process, where the project Studio works in open collaboration Through facilitated workshops, charrettes, and design reviews, the studio tests spatial ideas, policy interventions, and programmatic elements. Feedback loops are short and deliberate: ideas are developed, challenged, refined, and reimagined in close consultation with those affected. The process honours both technical insight and lived experience, ensuring that emerging designs are inclusive, grounded, and place-specific. Co- design activity runs continuously alongside the Living Lab, enabling a dynamic exchange between stakeholder insight and design development. The Living Lab transforms the precinct into a site of active experimentation and engagement. Running in parallel with the Co- Design process, it enables real-world testing of ideas while deepening community connection to the project. The Living Lab will host a dynamic program of public activations including speaker panels, educational workshops, temporary art installations, gallery exhibitions, design showcases, and cultural events co-led by local creatives curated by our Arts and Culture workstream. These activations offer low-barrier entry points for the public to explore, critique, and influence the emerging vision. The Living Lab also supports pilot infrastructure trials and urban greening demonstrations. Blending artistic expression, knowledge sharing, and community-led activity, the Living Lab makes the planning process visible, tangible, and participatory, a prototype of the precinct’s future. This is a key stage for the development of the Playbook, with the visual, film and artistic elements developed at this time serving both as inspiration and instruction guides for community lead precinct scale interventions to come. Deliverable: Activation Outcomes Report This phase advances the preferred concept into fully resolved design documentation. Studio team collaborates closely with technical consultants across engineering, ecology, infrastructure, heritage, and planning to test feasibility, performance, and regulatory alignment. Detailed layouts are developed, incorporating movement networks, land use distribution, open space hierarchies, stormwater systems, and blue-green infrastructure. Documentation of how decisions are supported by modelling, cost estimation, risk analysis, and input from statutory agencies. Materials, form, and landscape treatments are tested for constructability, cultural integrity, and climate resilience. The brand and communication strategy is refined into a practical toolkit that includes visual identity guidelines, key messaging, narrative tone, and engagement templates. These tools ensure consistent, place- based storytelling across all platforms, enabling partners to communicate the precinct’s vision clearly, confidently, and with a unified public-facing voice. Deliverable: Final Concept Design and Brand & Comms Strategy Living Lab Northern Rivers Facilitated by consortium academic partner, UTS School of Design 58 8 9 Staging & Costing Final Investment Ready Precinct Plan All consortium members to assess how different parts of the plan will be funded, built and governed. The team will develop a staged delivery framework with associated capital and operational cost estimates. This includes detailed phasing plans, bill of quantities, funding pathway analysis, and lifecycle cost modelling. Economic, social, and environmental impacts will be quantified to inform prioritisation, sequencing, and business case development for each stage. Strategic and statutory planning specialists will assess zoning, overlays, and regulatory frameworks to map approval pathways. They will prepare planning assessments, identify required amendments, and align the design with relevant SEPPs, LEPs, and state policies. This work informs staging, de-risks delivery, and supports a clear, coordinated approvals strategy. The aim is to give governments and partners the confidence that the project is ready to go and can be delivered fairly, efficiently and with broad community support. Deliverable: Draft Budget & Staging Plan The final phase consolidates all technical, cultural, economic, and spatial inputs into a cohesive, Investment Ready Precinct Plan. The document will include detailed spatial frameworks, delivery staging, capital and operational costings, governance models, risk mitigation strategies, and funding pathways. It will be supported by high-quality visualisations, policy alignment mapping, and statutory planning guidance. The plan will be reviewed and validated through a final round of stakeholder engagement, ensuring it reflects shared objectives and is ready for government and investor consideration. It will be delivered as a digital and physical package capable of informing funding bids, implementation strategies, and regulatory approvals. It will be explicitly designed to be suitable to proceed to NSW Treasury Gateway 1. The Playbook will be finalised as an open-access digital toolkit, shared via a dedicated website and public sector knowledge platforms.

Workstream contributions Activity of these groups varies considerably across the project timeline. • Civil and environmental will be active early undertaking baseline studies, then again in design development. • Economics and Impact: Represents the key business case team, with most of their actives in stage 9 Staging and Costing • Community and arts are both active in the middle phases of the project, returning in a small way later for activations work. • Planning and legal team members contribute across the project providing advice. For key features of this budget • The Secretariat/Backbone: This is a consistent thread through the project and their role includes leadership, convening and project management functions. • The Studio represents the main architects and designs, noting that they will be contracted by their individual firms but work collectively. • Supporting Firms: These are the architectural firms supporting the studio undertaking technical tasks such as drafting. • Academic and Expert Panels are primarily a first and second stage activity, but a small allocation is held back for advice and activations. • Playbook has a small budget allocations as this includes only its direct costs, with the main content produced alongside the main design and technical work. • Living lab represents the occupancy costs of the site office which doubles as an event space with associated costs. 63 An excerpts from UTS Masters Studio Kogerah Scheming – Reimagining Rushcutters: Radical Co-existence in the Post-Carbon City Delivered by consortium partner, Tom Rivard 9.3 The Playbook Documenting Our Process: A Guide for Future Harbour Precincts To ensure Rushcutters Bay’s lessons have lasting impact, we will rigorously document the planning process through two complementary streams. • Ethnographic research by ThinkPlace will capture stakeholder experiences and the cultural narratives that shape community connection to place. • Community-based action research facilitated by Regen Sydney, which will embed content from local participants, and the academic roundtables in cycles of inquiry and co-creation, surfacing grassroots insights that will and can guide systemic change. Together, these methods will culminate in a publicly accessible and action-oriented guide designed to inspire and empower other communities and government agencies to address coastal climate risk and deliver beloved, resilient urban parklands. This guide will comprise three primary components: • Documentary Artefacts: A collection of short films, photography, vox pops, and interactive visuals capturing the project’s development, key challenges, and lessons learned. Designed to inform and inspire similar efforts elsewhere. • A Catalogue of Nature-Based Solutions: Produced with the NSW Government Architect and Reconstruction Authority, this resource outlines tested NbS interventions with performance metrics, siting advice, design guidance, and material recommendations for use in coastal and urban settings. • “Friends of” Brand Toolkit: A ready-to-use kit for local community groups, featuring branding templates, engagement tools, and messaging guides to support grassroots organising and align with government renewal strategies. ‘The BIG U - Promoting Resilience Post-Sandy Through Innovative Planning & Design' by REBUILD BY DESIGN Examples of how a kit of parts approach can be developed. 6465 By creating shareable tools and tested methodologies, this documentation will directly address the structural barriers to coordinated urban renewal and adaptation. It enables state and local governments, agencies, and communities across Australia to act before disaster strikes with greater speed, equity, and confidence. This work supports national policy by translating federal priorities into local action. It aligns with the National Climate Resilience Strategy, Nature Positive Plan, National Urban Policy, and Closing the Gap Agreement, providing practical tools that will empower communities. Puhinui Regeneration Strategy A playbook approach by consortium partner Tamara Obradovic Scaling Nature-based Solutions We have identified a significant gap in NSW policy and guidance on the use of nature-based solutions (NbS) to support climate risk adaptation, urban resilience, and biodiversity outcomes. As a key deliverable of this grant we propose developing clear guidelines supported by a catalogue of evidence- based prototypes. This forms the most important part of the playbook and will improve understanding, acceptance and practical uptake of these strategies. When applied across private developments, infrastructure projects and the public domain, nature-based solutions help mitigate climate impacts while enhancing natural amenity for communities. The use of nature as infrastructure harnesses natural processes to tackle environmental challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss and urban vulnerability. By integrating green infrastructure, like wetlands, urban forests and permeable surfaces, these solutions boost carbon sequestration, support healthy ecosystems and create vibrant, climate-adaptive urban spaces that improve community well-being. The successful application of this kit of parts approach at a precinct scale is explored in Attachment P case studies. Our partnerships with the University of Sydney, UNSW and UTS will allow us to produce this document in a low cost, highly evidenced-based way. Contribution of project IP to this public good document forms a key part of the in-kind contribution of our consultant and design partners. Value for money for the Australian Government 9.4 Contributions by partners 66 Bays West Masterplan Designed by consortium partners, Turf Design Studio and Atelier Ten Services in kind by partners Each member of the consortium of delivery partners has considerably discounted their rates due to the cultural, social and environmental importance of this project. This is especially the case as a prototype for how Australia can respond to the emerging triple crisis of climate, nature and housing. This represents a value to government of $770,000 compared to commercial market rates. Community Activations, Arts and First Nations Partners are not discounting their rates as investment in these sectors is vital to the development of a regional cultural economy. 67 Why here? Why now? The challenges we seek to address at Rushcutters Bay; climate risk, legacy pollution, infrastructure renewal, biodiversity loss, and urban disconnection, are not unique to this site. They are archetypal of the pressures facing every coastal urban precinct across Australia. So why begin here, in one of the nation’s most affluent postcodes? Preliminary investigation (Section 4.3) suggests that, from the perspective of both the NSW State and Australian Governments, this project could be revenue-neutral or better. This creates an ongoing value for money for government, with the initial investment of the uPPP acting as true catalytic capital. 9.5 A Revenue Positive Precinct 'No soccer today' After it rains the sports fields of Rushcutters Bay become unusable, often for weeks. We recognise Treasury’s traditional caution toward value capture mechanisms. To build a framework which can mitigate their concerns our consortium includes national leading experts in regenerative finance: • Professor Bronwen Morgan of Regen Sydney, • Dr Nina Terry of ThinkPlaceX • Dr. Michelle Maloney of Australian Earth Laws Alliance • Ellen Witte of SGS Economics • Bellina Bean of South Pole • With support from globally leading experts from The University of Sydney, UTS & UNSW. This precinct plan could serve as a replicable test case for other harbourside precincts, enabling urgent infrastructure renewal and climate mitigation at scale without placing unsustainable pressure on public finances or forcing a choice between this project and other more urgent government priorities. It may provide a way we can respond to the triple crisis, everywhere, all at once. How do we pay for it? Our initial inquiry has identified many revenue and cost saving streams. • Forward facing income streams: Direct revenue from the project is likely to include increased marina income, cultural venue activation and commercial tenancies within new public infrastructure. • Future tourism revenue: Sydney Harbour is Australia’s most valuable tourism asset, generating approximately $6 billion annually. If this project increases that revenue by just 1%, it could alone fully offset its likely delivery cost. • Direct development returns: We have identified capacity for 2,000 new homes on government-owned land in one of Australia’s most valuable residential areas. Even with 50% dedicated to social, affordable, and key worker housing, the project offers a strong return on investment for the State of NSW. • Build-to-rent revenue: Tenancies for key and creative workers can augment precinct revenue while delivering a critical public good. • Market mechanisms: The project could access carbon markets, stormwater nutrient offsets, biodiversity credits, and in the near future, nature repair certificates by restoring canopy, seagrass, wetlands, and oyster reefs. • Developer contributions: The precinct is surrounded by over $3B of Transport Orientated Development in the approval pipeline, providing a likely source of funding through developer contributions, VPA’s and off-site affordable housing offsets. • Operational costs savings: Via improved public health, social cohesion, and reduced health system strain. Reduced costs through water security, insurability, and active transport will further reduce government expenditure. • Avoided loss: The reduction of catastrophic flood risk for over 150 homes will lower costs from property damage, insurance claims, disaster recovery, infrastructure repairs, emergency response costs and insurance bailouts. • Property value uplift: High-quality green infrastructure can increase nearby property values by 6–20%. With $4.5B in surrounding property, this project can deliver substantial uplift. The private value gained by the thousands of surrounding property owners can be partially captured by a special purpose levy. • Jobs and economic development Initial modelling suggests 700 FTE jobs over 3-5 years creating meaningful benefit for the State. Improvements to the recreational maritime services industry, arts, culture and tourism sector in our plan will also create enduring high value jobs. • Social/Economic Impact Bonds Although still embryotic in Australia, this project could provide a test case for capturing value from initiatives that improve healthy aging, reduce loneliness, enhance safety and education, boost food and water security, and support arts, sport, and restoring commons. Section 10 Closing words 68 With this grant, we can begin to turn the tide not just against climate risk, but against the fragmentation, disconnection, exclusion, and ecological loss that has defined too much of our urban past. We can reconnect communities with Country, restore the ecosystems that sustain us, and enable the kind of housing and infrastructure our cities urgently need. We can together collectively revitalise the critical part of urban area to be greener, healthier and more connected for the many Australians who call it home, and the millions of future visitors who will enjoy this great urban place. This is not just a plan for regenerating Rushcutters Bay, it is a scalable model for resilience, regeneration and reconnection across Australia’s vulnerable foreshore precincts. We have the partners, the place, and the plan. Now, we need to bring it to life.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
