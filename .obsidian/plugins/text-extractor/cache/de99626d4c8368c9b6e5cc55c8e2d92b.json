In this time, I have done a lot of sitting, and a lot of trying to quiet my mind, and a lot of forgiving myself for not quieting my mind, and more recently a little bit of not trying quite so hard to quiet my mind. \"Paying attention on purpose in the present moment and non-judgmentally. Sometimes I like to add the phrase 'as if your life depended on it'\" (Kabatt-Zinn. 16) really struck a chord with me after reading the Relaxation Response. I hadn't given much thought to the why of meditation. It was just something I was supposed to do. Reflecting on the statistics for poor health outcomes, \"These diseases of the heart and brain account for more than 50 percent of the deaths each year in the United States.\" (Benson. 37) Combining these two readings gave me both the perspective, and a new commitment to really being present, without judgement (that last part being my current work). I found it much easier to meditate this week, when I was not holding myself to an ideal, but rather experiencing the meditation; letting myself \"be breathed\" (Kabatt-Zinn. 16)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
