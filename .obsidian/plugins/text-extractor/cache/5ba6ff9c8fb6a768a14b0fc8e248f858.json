Now we turn to calculating the margin of error for means (averages). In order to continue we must learn to read a new table, entitled the t-Distribution: Critical t Values. Just as calculating the margin of error for percentages required a Zα/2 based on a confidence level, calculating the margin of error for the mean requires a tα/2 based on a confidence level. The tα/2 values that we will need are found by taking two values to the t-table: 1) degrees of freedom 2) error (denoted α, pronounced alpha) Degrees of freedom are equal to sample size, n, minus 1. For example: If sample size is 50, there are 49 degrees of freedom. If the specified confidence level (cl) is 95%, then the error (α) is the other 5%. The error, α, is expressed in decimal form. A cl of 90% leads to α = 0.10 A cl of 95% leads to α = 0.05 A cl of 98% leads to α = 0.02 Page of 1 7 You can find the t-table printed on the front side of the last page of the textbook. I have also attached a file to this assignment that contains the table. Let’s practice finding tα/2 values from the t-table. The t-distribution, as seen below, is a bell-shaped curve. It looks much like the normal distribution, it just tends to be thinner, like someone squeezed a normal curve. Consider a confidence level of 98%. That means the error, α = 0.02. The 2% of error is split between the tails of the t-curve. 1% in each tail. The 98% of confidence is represented by all the area under the curve between the tails. Example 1: A sample size, n, of 10 and a confidence level of 95% degrees of freedom = 9 α = 0.05 (remember, α is the total area in two tails) Find 9 in the left most, degrees of freedom, column. Find 0.05 in the Area in Two Tails row. At the intersection you find 2.262. That is the tα/2 for n = 10 and cl = 95% Degrees of Area in Two Tails Freedom 0.05 Page of 2 7 9 2.262 Example 2: Find the tα/2 for n = 32 and cl = 99% degrees of freedom = 31 α = 0.01 (remember, α is the total area in two tails) Find 31 in the left most column of the t-table in your book. Find 0.01 in the Area in Two Tails row. At the intersection you find, 2.744. 2.744 is the tα/2 for n = 32 and cl = 99% Example 3: Find the tα/2 for n = 49 and cl = 90% 48 degrees of freedom is not listed. We obey normal rounding rules and use 50 degrees of freedom. α = 0.10 At the intersection we find, tα/2 = 1.676. Example 4: Find the tα/2 for n = 108 and cl = 98% degrees of freedom = 107 α = 0.02 At the intersection we find, tα/2 = 2.364. Page of 3 7Page of 4 7 Now we are ready for the formula for calculating the margin of error, denoted E, for the mean (averages). Pronounced, the margin of error for the mean equals, tα/2, times the sample standard deviation, divided by the square root of the sample size. tα/2 is found in the t-table. s, the sample standard deviation, will be given in the problem. n is the given sample size. The sample mean denoted , will also be given. Our job will be to calculate an interval estimate for the population mean. This interval will be the sample mean plus or minus the margin of error. We will estimate at a specified confidence level, that the population mean, denoted , is trapped within the interval from to . Now we are ready to put all the parts together. Example 5: We have a sample size of 38 n = 38 a sample mean of 14 =14 a sample standard deviation of 2 s = 2 and a confidence level of 95% cl = 95% Our job is to find the interval . It is given that =14, so all we have to do is calculate , the margin of error. We have 37 degrees of freedom, and total area (error) in two tails, α = 0.05 From the t-table we find tα/2 = 2.026 E = t a 2 ( s n ) ¯x ¯x ± E μ ¯x + E ¯x − E ¯x ¯x ± E ¯x E Page of 5 7 We now turn to the formula for the margin of error for the mean. = 0.66 =14 and = 0.66. Our interval is , 14 Conclusion: We estimate, at the 95% level, that the population mean, , is somewhere in the interval 14 0.66. Example 6: In a sample of 106 Fahrenheit scale body temperatures, the sample mean is 98.20° and the sample standard deviation is 0.62°. Construct a 95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean for body temperature. n = 106 = 98.20 s = 0.62 cl = 95% Our job is to find the interval . It is given that = 98.20, so all we have to do is calculate , the margin of error. We have 105 degrees of freedom and α = 0.05 From the t-table we find tα/2 = 1.984 We now turn to the formula for the margin of error for the mean. = 0.12 So, = 98.20°F and = 0.12°F. Our interval is , 98.20°F 0.12°F E = t a 2 ( s n ) = 2.026( 2 38 ) = 2.026(0.3244) ¯x E ¯x ± E ± 0.66 μ ± ¯x ¯x ± E ¯x E E = t a 2 ( s n ) = 1.984( 0.62 106 ) = 1.984(0.0602) ¯x E ¯x ± E ± Page of 6 7 Conclusion: We estimate, at the 95% level, that the population mean, , for body temperature is in the interval 98.20°F 0.12°F. Example 7: The FDA took ten samples of brown rice from California. The average amount of arsenic present was 6.35 micrograms, with a standard deviation of 2.33 micrograms. Construct a 90% confidence interval estimate of the population mean for arsenic in such samples of brown rice. n = 10 = 6.35 s = 2.33 cl = 90% Our job is to find the interval . It is given that = 6.35, so all we have to do is calculate , the margin of error. We have 9 degrees of freedom and α = 0.10 From the t-table we find tα/2 = 1.833 We now turn to the formula for the margin of error for the mean. = 1.35 So, = 6.35 and = 1.35. Our interval is 6.35 1.35 mcg Conclusion: We estimate, at the 90% level, that the population mean, , for micrograms of arsenic in such samples of brown rice is in the interval 6.35 1.35 mcg. μ ± ¯x ¯x ± E ¯x E E = t a 2 ( s n ) = 1.833( 2.33 10 ) = 1.833(0.7368) ¯x E ± μ ± Page of 7 7","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
