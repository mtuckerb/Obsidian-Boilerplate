Course Descrip1on “One of the many possible ways to describe a life would be as a series of encounters with various bodies of water.” Wallace J. Nichols, Blue Mind Welcome to Academic Writing. ENG 102 is designed to prepare you for the study and practice of argument and research-based writing through further engagement with the writing process and critical reading. This course satisfies the University’s WRI II requirement. We will begin with several readings and short assignments on the theme of water and work up to the writing of a research paper on a themed topic of your choice. In addition, assignments include a remediation project and an essay on your own writing process. As a fundamental part of your General Education at the University of Southern Maine, Academic Writing emphasizes academic work as a recursive process of inquiry. The course will focus on academic modes of reading and writing to help you address and pursue new and existing questions about critical issues. You should expect to read, reread, write, critique, argue, and reflect on a variety of sources and texts that we will read together, as well as discover new sources and texts through independent research. Through these processes, you ENG 102 Academic Wri1ng Spring 2025 Instructor Info Elizabeth K. Dodge Email: edodge@maine.edu Hours: By appointment\t \t\t\t Course Mee1ngs 304 Payson Smith T/Th 11:00-12:15 \t Academic\tServices\t&\tPolicies will learn to connect and make meaning between sources and synthesize your own point of view. You will also develop information literacy through the practice of evaluating the quality of sources, as well as the logic, style, and structure of material in academic arguments and various writing genres. This is an RLE (Research Learning Experience) course, a course that includes activities outside the classroom and that emphasizes building community both with classmates and the community at large as part of the learning process. The RLE activities are funded by a grant from the Alfond Foundation, an organization that works to enhance education in Maine. Following the modules in this Brightspace course should keep you on track. Learning of any kind requires initiative and organization. If you are ever uncertain or have questions, please let me know. Email is the best way to reach me outside of class. Ask sooner rather than later! Important: Please check your USM email every day in case I, or any of your other instructors, am trying to reach you with a question or concern. 3 cr. 1B. Course Materials & Books Required ● Course Brightspace (For tech requirements, see the Academic Services & Policies page .) 1 ● Please bring your laptop to class, as well. 1C. Course Format The class will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8:00-9:15. At these sessions, students can expect a mixture of brief lectures, presentations, discussion of the week’s course materials, and reminders/announcements/updates. An RLE field trip and related assignments are also part of the course. This collaborative experiential learning experience is meant to help build a sense of community and connection in this course. The instructor will be available for meetings by appointment. 1D. Course Learning Outcomes By writing, reading, and engaging in both inquiry and discussion in this course, you will work to improve your ability to: 1.

Read actively and critically for a variety of analytical and rhetorical purposes. 3.

Adhere to shared standards for academic integrity and intellectual property through informed source evaluation and correct documentation. 8. Articulate the ongoing development of your own writing processes and strategies and their relationship to your personal values, academic growth, and life goals. RLE Cognitive Outcomes: 1. Students will formulate appropriately scoped topics or questions that will guide their scholarly exploration. 2. Students will describe their iterative approaches to exploration for work without a defined answer. 3. Students will effectively communicate with collaborators about their experience. 4. Students will demonstrate responsibility for the discovery process. RLE Dispositional Outcomes 1. Students will identify the relevance/applicability of their experience beyond the RLE course. 2. Students will reflect on how their exploratory process has helped them develop as learners. 3. Students will explain the importance of belonging to a community for their learning. 1E. AI Policy As scholars and educators specializing in English and Writing Studies and as members of the faculty responsible for the WRI sequence, we have a profound commitment to upholding the standards of writing instruction across all University courses. Hence, we emphasize the following: Writing to learn constitutes a fundamental intellectual pursuit essential for the cognitive and social growth of all students. Because writing itself is a form of thinking, it cannot be replaced by AI language tools and generators. Indeed, using AI masks the intelligence and creativity of the student writer, the cultivation of which is the focus of writing courses. The use of generative AI for content creation is a form of cheating and a violation of the University of Southern Maine's policy on Academic Integrity. \t Academic\tWriting\t\t-\tCourse\tSyllabus\t \t3 2.

AWendance Attendance is extremely important to your success in Academic Writing; it is part of your Participation grade, which is 30% of your course grade. For this reason, you are expected to attend class unless you are ill. You must stay for the whole period, and participate in discussions in order to be counted as present. If you become ill and can’t come to class, please email me to let me know when you expect to return. You will be expected to obtain any necessary notes from another student. 4B. Late Work Part of what you are graded on in this course is faithfully carrying out the writing process, which includes drafting, revising, editing, and proofreading. For this reason, I have the following policies regarding late submissions: Most course writing assignments require an Early Draft, which I review and comment on. Early Drafts are not accepted late. Early Drafts submitted on time will receive comments. Most students consider Early Draft comments to be helpful in successfully revising their work, so getting comments on Early Drafts (by submitting them on time) is recommended. Assignments will be revised, usually several times, before receiving a grade. Final Drafts may be submitted up to one week late but if not submitted on time, will receive a reduction of one full grade (A- to B-, for example). After one week, a Final Draft will not receive an honor grade except in case of illness or emergency. \t Academic\tWriting\t\t-\tCourse\tSyllabus\t \t11 4C. Class Cancella1on If class is canceled because of inclement weather or an unexpected event such as a power outage on campus, I will provide instructions through a Brightspace announcement. Please check Brightspace for my message. 4D. Inclement Weather Con1ngencies Please see entry 4C above. 4E. Personal Device Usage in the Classroom We will sometimes write in class, so please bring your laptop. However, I expect you to be mentally present in class, as well as physically present. That means making periodic eye contact with me and with others who are speaking. If I observe that you are being continually distracted by your laptop and/or phone during class, your Participation grade at the end of the semester will be reduced. Earbuds must be removed during class. 5.
