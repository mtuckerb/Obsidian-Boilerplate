Environmental, social, and logistical issues are motivatingAmericans to abandon automobility in favor of more efficient,clean, and socially responsible public transportation. (Enright.p665).As this trend continues, it is incumbent upon the city ofPortland Maine's government, business leaders, and communitymembers to continue to build and maintain systems andschedules of public transportation that do the most good for themost people, while simultaneously and specifically avoiding harmto underserved and high need constituent consumers.This article aims to propose and defend the creation of a freeand equitable public transport system for Portland, to serve thevalues and interests of the majority of Portland's populationEarly Transportation Network inPortland, MaineIn 1909, when Portland urban border extended from thePeninsula to Ocean Avenue, the city boasted a transportationsystem that ran hourly to destinations as far afield as SouthWindham, Old Orchard Beach, and Lewiston.Interestingly, the trolly system of this era was established andmaintained by the Grand Trunk Railroad, a British North American[Canadain] company, and as with most transportation systems ofthe time, was intended to foster commerce in the North Easternregion of North America.It is startling to observe how sparse the population was insome of the areas serviced circa 1909. In this \"Birds Eye View\"we see that the lines extending out of the urban region of Portlandare populated by only a few homes. This illustrates thecontemporary social justice agendas of that era. In 1909, farmingand agriculture in Maine were predominantly, family operated andlower income families tended to live and work in the urban center.All transport infrastructures condense social andpolitical ideals. Mass urban transit in other words is alwayspursued for distinct purposes, and for the benefit of someurban dwellers and to the detriment of others. (Enright.p666)Fig 1.Reflecting on the story being told by this transportationillustration (Fig 1.), it is clear that the \"exemplary public good,\"(Enright. p667) that these systems served aligned with connectingagricultural products and tourist destinations to consumers andtourists, and not, specifically, towards promoting social equity andjustice.21st Century Portland TransportAn economic appealAs we enter this post-auto-mobility era, it is crucial that weconsider what impact our lower and middle-income population hashad and will have on the economic, tourism, and culturalsuccesses of Portland. Without a thriving working class,businesses of Portland may face a labor shortage, and increasingsalaries, as lower and middle income families struggle to accessemployment within a reasonable commute from their homes.Further, it is important to consider the value that artists,musicians, street vendors, and other creatives bring to our city'ssuccess. As those populations find it increasingly difficult to findaffordable housing within walking distance of the centers ofcommerce, we must endeavor to prioritize their access and senseMass transit systems are imbricated in fundamentalquestions about who belongs in the city, who is allowed toparticipate fully in urban activities, who decides how spacewill be planned and produced, and who gains from urbantransformation (Enright p666)of belonging to this community, lest they seek to find thatbelonging in more deserving communities.A social justice appealFig 2.Fig 2. shows Portland's transportation map, overlayed withthe Red (\"Hazardous\") and Yellow (\"Definitely Declining\") zones[Transit-led urbanism] also has the potential to entrenchexisting hierarchies and to create new forms of urbanmarginality, inequality, and exclusion. Transit can be a vectorof progressive change, or it can threaten bodily integrity,drive uneven development, segregate populations, ‘splinter’urban space (Graham and Marvin 2001), reduce democraticinfluence, contribute to environmental injustice, and replicateand generate oppressive social relations. (Enright. p666)from the 1935 City of Portland \"Redline Map.\" It is remarkable tosee how, in all cases except where access to \"Best\" and \"StillDesirable\" zones demand, the Red zones and Yellow zones seemto be circumvented completely.With affordable housing on the peninsula all but out of reach forlow and middle income families and individuals, access toemployment, services, entertainment, and in fact, belonging are,by intention or oversight, denied to these populations.Further, this overlay, while useful in describing the servicearea does not address the scheduling or cardinality of travel forthese lines. For example, a Casco Bay High School student, livingon Washington Ave can take a quick 20 minute ride to school onthe 9B in the morning, but must take a 45 minute ride on the 9Aon the way home, if they are not able to walk for 15 minutes. For astudent with a disability, this is an enormous burden. Note on theoverlay transportation map, how the 9A/B lines serve largely\"Definitely Declining,\" communities.For a community to champion values such as desegregation,equality, inclusion, bodily autonomy, and justice, it must ensurethat the fundamental access for a people to the services andaffordances of that community are equally available to all. A fair,free, and just public transportation system providing access to andfrom all parts of the community is within reach, and absolutelynecessary if Portland is to embody these values.THE TRANSPORT GOODDefinitionFor the purpose of simplicity and consistency with other texts,the product that we will be optimizing will be referred to as the\"Transport Good\"–\"Good\" in this context meaning a product orservice, rather than a moral good—(Martins. pp2-8).Optimization of the TransportGoodIn order for our public transportation system to equitably andjustly serve our community, we must first agree on what justiceand equity mean in this context.Whether one wishes to optimize the Transport Good for socialbenefit (e.g. ideal person accessibility) (Martins. p6), or seeks tooptimize for economic benefit, some outcomes will remainconstant. This paper limits its focus to those areas of overlappingbenefit.If Portland wishes to maintain its reputation as a smallrelaxed seaside city, we must ensure that the working people ofthe city continue to have relaxed, well supported lives, so thatease will be naturally apparent when they interface with thevisiting population.Freedom of choice and potential mobility are stronglyintertwined—with a high level of potential mobility implying aPortland is currently an unfriendly city to the automobilecommuter. With an overabundance of 2 hour (or less) parking inthe downtown area, there are precious few available day-longparking spots for retail workers. With 1 bedroom rents in thedowntown area largely out of reach for retail income earners, thispresents a significant obstacle for business owners in the area.How can employees working for low hourly rates even afford toget to work?This paucity of available, day-long parking, combined with theaforementioned socioeconomic benefit begs the question whetherpublic transportation belongs in its on distributive sphere of socialjustice. That is to say, should transportation be refactored as apublic service like parks, waste management and sanitation,street cleaning, education, and environmental protection.In his paper\"Justice in transport as justice in accessibility:\"Martens explains how goods (such as transport) \"with distinctsocial meanings\" should be distributed \"solely on the basis ofcriteria that are relevant for those goods.\" (p15) According toWalzer,high level of choice in terms of employment opportunities,health care services, leisure facilities, and so forth.\"a distributive sphere should guarantee that thedistribution of the particular good is autonomous from theway in which other goods are distributed. According toWalzer, injustice occurs if spheres are not autonomous. Inthat case, the distribution of one good or one set of goodsTo summarize, Martens via Walzer is suggesting that allowingfree market economics to govern the management of a socialgood like transportation, is inherently unjust and will ultimatelylead to diminishing the benefits that that good is meant to providefor society.SUMMARYHaving established the social and economic value of a fairand just public transportation system, the remaining question ishow might such a system be implemented to maximize the publicbenefit. It is clear from the cited research that a Transport Goodshould not be administered under the same economic system andrules that govern the distribution of other goods, lest thosesystems corrupt the benefits that the Transport Good seeks toprovide.can become dominant and determine the distributions in all,or many, spheres of distribution. Typically, according toWalzer, money and power are the goods to claimdominance, and much of the policy debates, like those in thefields of basic education or health services, are aboutlimiting their domination. (Martins. p3)Goods to which a particular society ascribes a distinctsocial meaning, in contrast, are to be taken out of thesphere of free exchange. Typical examples in modernA free public transport system in Portland could engender thesocial, economic and even environmental outcomes that serve themyriad values of Portland residents, visitors and business ownershold. By removing capitalist drivers, city administrators would beempowered to focus on delivery of service to lower and middleincome regions, improve the infrastructure—perhaps reintroducingan electric trolly system, powered by local solar fields—andrefactor scheduling and ordinality of routes, so that students,retail/service workers, and tourists, have swift, reliable, and lowemission service to their destinations of choice.BIBLIOGRAPHYBirds Eye View showing Portland R.R.
