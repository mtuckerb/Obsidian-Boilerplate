In accordance with Maine law, the child support order is suspended while you receive assistance, but will automatically start again two weeks after you stop receiving assistance, in the same amount as before you began receiving it (19-A MRS §2302(2)). If you owed a child support debt prior to your receipt of public assistance, you still owe that debt, and it may be collected from lump sum income as deﬁned in 22 MRS §3762(11) while you are receiving assistance (see 19-A MRS §2302(2)). The Department may not engage in any other collection actions against you during this time. However, you may continue to make voluntary payments and you will continue to receive monthly billing statements. The custodial parent has a right to ﬁle a Motion to Modify, to ask a judge or hearing ofﬁcer to order you to pay child support even though you are receiving assistance.
