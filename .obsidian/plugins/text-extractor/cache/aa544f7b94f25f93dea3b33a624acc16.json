In this lesson we will look at how the margin of error, in this case 3%, is calculated. When a survey is conducted, usually not everyone in the target population is surveyed. Only a sample of the population is surveyed. In order for the results to be responsibly reported, a margin of error must be attached, acknowledging that the result might vary a bit if the whole population were surveyed. Again, consider the survey result 65% ± 3%. Of the sample of people asked, 65% said yes. However, not everyone in the population was asked, so there is error in the result. This error is calculated with a specified level of certainty. In this case, certainty that the actual percentage of yes respondents, if the entire population was asked, would be in the interval 65% ± 3%, restated 62% to 68%. This specified level of certainty is called the confidence level. Below is the formula for the Margin of Error for Proportions (percentages). denotes the margin of error. (Z with a subscript of /2, pronounced z alpha over 2) is a z-score based on the specified confidence level. (lower case p with a caret symbol on top) denotes the percentage that said yes (lower case q with a caret symbol on top) denotes the percentage that said no n is the sample size Pronounced E equals z alpha over 2, times the square root of p-hat times q-hat divided by n, end of square root. We now need to look at how to use a specified confidence level to determine the correct Zα/2 for use in the Margin of Error Formula. Consider a confidence level of 90% E zα∕2 α ^p ^q E = za∕2 ^p ^q n Page of 1 5 There is a small table, entitled Common Critical Values, located at the bottom right corner of the Positive z-scores table. A confidence level of 90%, 0.90 matches up with a critical value of 1.645. 1.645 is the Zα/2 we use for a confidence level of 90%. In the same fashion, from the table, 1.96 is the Zα/2 for 95% and 2.575 is the Zα/2 for 99%. For your ease of reference, I have recreated the 2 by 4 table. Common Critical Values Now we will put this all together into an example. Confidence Level Critical Value 0.90 1.645 0.95 1.96 0.99 2.575 Page of 2 5 EXAMPLE 1 A sample of 850 people responded to a yes/no survey question. 70% said yes. Not every member of the population was asked, so we must report our results with a margin of error. We will report the results at a confidence level of 95%. for 95% is 1.96 = 70% = 0.7 = 30% = 0.3 n = 850 = = = = = 0.031 = 3.1% The margin of error is ± 3.1% = 70%. 70% of the people we surveyed said yes. But we did not survey the entire population, so we must attach our calculated margin of error, = 3.1%. We will report our answer in the form ± . This form is called a confidence interval. Conclusion: At the 95% confidence level, we estimate the actual percentage of the population that would say yes is contained in the interval 70% ± 3.1%. Restated, in the interval from 66.9% to 73.1%.

Construct a 90% confidence interval estimate of the population percentage (the percentage we estimate would say yes if we could ask the entire population). Zα/2 at 90% =1.645 = 75% = 0.75 = 25% = 0.25 n = 1,000 = = = = = 0.023 = 2.3% Conclusion: At the 95% confidence level, we estimate the actual percentage of the population that would say yes is contained in the interval 75% ± 2.3%. EXAMPLE 3 A sample of 960 people were surveyed and 28% said yes. Construct a 99% confidence interval estimate of the population percentage (the percentage we estimate would say yes if we could ask the entire population). Zα/2 at 99% = 2.575 = 28% = 72% n = 960 = = 3.7% Conclusion: At the 99% confidence level, we estimate the actual percentage of the population that would say yes is contained in the interval 28% ± 3.7%. ^p ^q E = 1.645 (0.75)(0.25) 1,000 1.645 0.1875 1000 1.645(0.013693) 0.0225 ^p ^q E = 2.575 (0.28)(0.72) 960 0.0373 Page of 4 5Page of 5 5","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
