ENG 100 is designed to prepare you for writing you will do in college classes. As a fundamental part of your General Education at the University of Southern Maine, College Writing emphasizes critical thinking and communication. The course focuses on writing and reading, and particularly on the conversation, revision, editing, and proofreading processes that produce strong, clear, and interesting work. You will learn how to understand and think critically about the ideas and language of others and how to develop and articulate your own ideas about what you have read. You will have opportunities to participate in collaborative and social aspects of writing processes, including giving and acting on productive feedback to works in progress, as well as explaining and accounting for your own composing processes. 3 cr. 1B. Course Materials & Books Required Everyone’s An Author, Lundsford et al., Fourth Edition, Norton, ISBN 978132404510 (paperback or eTextbook rental) Course Brightspace (For tech requirements, see the Academic Services & Policies page.) 1C. Course Format The class will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:00-12:15. At these sessions, students can expect a mixture of brief lectures, presentations, discussion of the week’s course materials, and reminders/announcements/updates. This structure is meant to ensure a sense of community and connection in this first-year class. Beyond this, the instructor will hold open student hours for at least two hours a week and/or schedule student hours at convenient times. Note: Following the modules in this Brightspace course should keep you on track. Learning of any kind requires initiative and organization: If you are ever uncertain or have questions, please let me know. Email is the best way to reach me. Ask sooner rather than later! Also, please check your email every day in case I am trying to reach you with a question or concern. 1D. Course Learning Outcomes At the conclusion of the course, students should be able to: 1. Identify and assess a variety of rhetorical situations and contexts, attending to such factors as purpose, audience, genre, mode, and textual conventions. 2. Utilize reading and writing strategies—such as analysis, interpretation, synthesis, response, and critique—to develop complex thoughts that lead to the formation of thesis-driven arguments. 3. Compose as a means to discover and reconsider their ideas and positions in light of additional information and source material. 4. Use flexible composing processes—such as reading, drafting, reviewing, collaborating, revising, editing, designing, and redesigning—to “re-see” their writing and extend their thinking through multiple drafts. 5. Consider and incorporate conventional usages of grammar, syntax, and style in relation to your rhetorical situation (purpose, audience, genre, mode, and textual conventions). 6. Understand the importance of source evaluation and documentation in relation to academic integrity and intellectual property and consistently deploy citation conventions. 7. Recognize and articulate the ongoing development of their own writing processes and strategies and understand how those relate to their personal values, academic growth, and life goals. 1E. AI Policy As scholars and educators specializing in English and Writing Studies, and as members of the faculty responsible for the WRI sequence, we have a profound commitment to upholding the standards of writing instruction across all University courses. Hence, we emphasize the following: Writing to learn constitutes a fundamental intellectual pursuit essential for the cognitive and social growth of all students. Because writing itself is a form of thinking, it cannot be replaced by AI language tools and generators. Indeed, using AI masks the intelligence and creativity of the student writer, the cultivation of which is the focus of writing courses. The use of generative AI for content creation is a form of cheating and a violation of the University’s policy on Academic Integrity.  2. Coursework & Grading 2A.

Course-Specific Policies 4A. Attendance You will learn new writing skills in this course; it is not a repeat of high school English. For this reason, you are expected to attend class unless you’re ill. It’s unlikely that you can earn an honor grade in this course without regular attendance. If you do need to miss a class, you will be expected to obtain any necessary notes from another student in our group. 4B. Late Work Part of what you are graded on in this course is faithfully carrying out the writing process, which includes drafting, revising, editing, and proofreading. For this reason, I have the following policies: Most of the course writing assignments require an Early Draft. Early Drafts are not accepted late. Early Drafts submitted on time will receive comments. Most students consider Early Draft comments to be helpful in successfully revising their work, so getting comments on Early Drafts (by submitting them on time) is recommended. Final Drafts may be submitted up to one week late but if not submitted on time, will receive a reduction of one full grade (A- to B-, for example). After one week, a Final Draft assignment will receive a grade of C or lower except in case of illness. 4C. Class Cancellation If class is canceled because of inclement weather or an unexpected event such as a power outage on campus, I will email instructions to everyone in the class. Please watch your email and follow my instructions. 4D. Inclement Weather Contingencies Please see entry 4C above. 4E. Personal Device Usage in the Classroom We will sometimes write in class, so please bring your laptop. However, I expect you to be mentally present in the class, as well as physically present. Earbuds must be removed. Working on assignments for other courses during this class is not acceptable; research has proven that multitasking reduces performance in both tasks. If I observe that you are being continually distracted by your laptop and/or phone during class, your Participation grade at the end of the semester will be reduced. The best way to demonstrate that you’re mentally present is to make frequent eye contact with me and to participate in discussions. Accessibility and Accommodations The University is committed to providing students with documented disabilities equal access to all University programs and services.
