Matthew Tucker Bradford ID: 07004573A LE-SL002 MATTHEW T. BRADFORD 7 PINE LEDGE TER PORTLAND, ME 04103 June 5, 2025 Your TANF Benefits – Important Information This is an annual notice, sent to all households receiving TANF. In Maine you can get TANF or PaS for a total of 60 months over your lifetime. How Does DHHS Count Up My 60-Month Limit? Each month you get TANF, since June 1, 1997, counts as a month toward your lifetime limit. Months you received TANF while living in another state count too. Can I Get TANF For More Than 60 Months? Some Maine families who meet \"hardship\" reasons can ask to get TANF for longer than 60 months. Before your TANF ends, you can ask to meet with your ASPIRE worker to see if you can get a TANF temporary \"hardship\" extension for one or more of the following reasons: • You are working at a paid job at least 35 hours per week; • You have lost your job through no fault of your own; • You are facing an emergency situation; • You are in your third trimester of pregnancy; • You are experiencing domestic violence; • You can't work due to your own medical condition or the medical condition of another family member living in your home; or • You are currently enrolled and making satisfactory progress in an approved education program. How Long Does an Extension Last? Extensions are temporary and may last up to 6 months. You may ask for additional extensions. Questions?

If you don't qualify for a \"hardship\" reason, your TANF will close at the end of your 60th month. You may still get MaineCare and SNAP if there are no other changes in your case. If you are working when your TANF closes, you may be able to get help with child care, transportation, and additional help with food. What If I Have Questions? Please contact your ASPIRE worker with questions at 1-844-653-0316 or by e-mail at helpME@fedcap.org. Page 3 of 4 NOTICE OF YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE ASPIRE-TANF AND PARENTS as SCHOLARS (PaS) PROGRAMS – IMPORTANT INFORMATION The ASPIRE Program helps people who get TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), or Parents as Scholars (PaS) with training, child care, transportation and other support services that you need to find a job. When Can I Work With ASPIRE? • You must work with ASPIRE if you want to get TANF or PaS benefits. • You must work with ASPIRE if your children are 1 year old or older, or you are a teen parent and don't have a high school diploma or high school equivalency. • Some people, such as SSI recipients and VISTA volunteers, do not have to work with ASPIRE. • People who must work with ASPIRE are called \"mandatory participants\". What Do I Have To Do If I Am A Mandatory Participant In ASPIRE? If you are a mandatory participant, you must follow the rules of the program. Following the rules includes coming in to meet with ASPIRE staff when you are asked, or calling or writing if you cannot come to a meeting. If you do not follow the rules, you and your family may lose all or part of your TANF (or PaS) and your SNAP benefits. You can get these benefits back when you start following the rules. If you do not start following the rules you will lose all of your TANF or PaS benefits after 90 days. If you do not follow the rules a second time you will lose all of your TANF or PaS benefits. The ASPIRE staff will explain the rules to you and give you a copy of the rules if you want to read them. What Can I Do If I Don't Agree With ASPIRE? If you believe that you have a good reason for not being in ASPIRE, or you have the right to talk to a supervisor. You also have the right to ask for an Administrative Hearing. You can do this by talking to your ASPIRE worker. Tell him or her you want a hearing. In an Administrative Hearing, a hearing officer will listen to you and to ASPIRE and decide who is right. At the Administrative Hearing you can represent yourself, have someone else represent you, or have a representative from Pine Tree Legal Assistance represent you. ASPIRE can help you contact Pine Tree Legal Assistance. What Are the Time Limits for Me to Appeal an ASPIRE Decision? • If you want an Administrative Hearing, you must ask for it within 30 days of receiving a letter from ASPIRE that you disagree with. • If you ask for an Administrative Hearing within 12 days of receiving the letter from ASPIRE, and if you so choose, your benefits will continue until the hearing officer makes a decision. If you are appealing the denial of an extension to the 60-month lifetime limit of TANF or PaS your benefits will not continue during the appeal period. • If you lose the hearing, you must pay back any benefits you received during the appeal process that you were not eligible for. Can I Volunteer For ASPIRE? If you do not have to sign up for ASPIRE, you may still volunteer for ASPIRE. If you volunteer you are called a \"voluntary participant\" and if you do not follow the rules, you will not lose TANF/PaS or SNAP benefits, but ASPIRE may stop providing you with services. If you are a voluntary participant, you may still have an Administrative Hearing if you disagree with ASPIRE.
