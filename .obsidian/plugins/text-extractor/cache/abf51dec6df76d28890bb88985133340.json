We studied this distribution because it is on the standard normal that the z-scores tables are based. The tables only work for the parameters, mean and standard deviation, of the standard normal. In order to work with other normal distributions, for example IQ and height, where the mean is not zero and the standard deviation is not 1, we need a conversion formula. This formula will take z-scores from any normal distribution and convert them to standard normal z-scores. We can then take these converted z’s to the tables and find indicated probabilities, just as we did in the previous lesson. IQ is normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. For completeness’ sake, the minimum usual is 70 and the maximum usual is 130. Recall from Lesson 2 Chapter 5 that: minimum usual = = = 70 maximum usual = = = 130 = 15 70 130 = 100 μ − 2σ 100 − 2(15) μ − 2σ 100 + 2(15) σ μ Page of 1 4 EXAMPLE 1: Let’s find the probability that a randomly selected person has an IQ less than 120. = 15 120 = 100 IQ scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The z-scores tables only work for the standard normal, where the mean is zero and the standard deviation is one. We must take our z of 120 and convert it to a standard normal z. This is the formula we use to convert any z-score to a standard normal z-score. The required standard normal z equals the score we want to convert ( ) minus the mean ( ) and then divided by the standard deviation ( ). For this example, we want to convert 120 to a standard normal z. = 120 = 100 = 15 = = 1.33 The z of 120 in the normal distribution for IQ, converts to a standard normal z of 1.33. Now we take the 1.33 to the positive z table, as we did in the previous lesson. 1.33 leads to an area (probability) of 0.9082. σ μ x μ σ z = x − μ σ x μ σ z = 120 − 100 15 20 15 Page of 2 4 = 1 0.9082 1.33 = 0 = 15 0.9082 120 = 100 Conclusion: The probability that a randomly selected person has an IQ less than 120 equals 0.9082, 91%. We can also conclude that 91% of the population has an IQ less than 120. EXAMPLE 2: What is the probability that a randomly selected person has an IQ over 130? Step 1: Convert the 130 to a standard normal z. = 130 = 100 = 15 = = 2.00 Step 2: Take the converted z of 2.00 to the table and find the probability of 0.9772. Step 3: Since the table values are always from the left tail up, 0.9772 is the probability of less than 130. 1 minus 0.9772, equal to 0.0228, is the probability of more than 130. σ μ σ μ z = x − μ σ x μ σ z = 130 − 100 15 30 15 Page of 3 4 Conclusion: The probability that a randomly selected person has an IQ over 130 is 0.0228, 2.3%. EXAMPLE 3: The heights of men are normally distributed with a mean of 68.6 inches and a standard deviation of 2.8 inches. What is the probability that a randomly selected man is less than 6 feet tall? First, we note that 6 feet equals 72 inches. Step 1: Convert the 72 to a standard normal z. = 72 = 68.6 = 2.8 = = 1.21 Step 2: Take the converted z of 1.21 to the table and find the probability of 0.8869. Step 3: Since the table values are always from the left tail up, 0.8869 is the probability of less than 72. Conclusion: The probability that a randomly selected man is less than 6 feet tall is 0.8869. Restated, 88.7% of men are less than 6 feet tall. z = x − μ σ x μ σ z = 72 − 68.6 2.8 3.4 2.8 Page of 4 4","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
