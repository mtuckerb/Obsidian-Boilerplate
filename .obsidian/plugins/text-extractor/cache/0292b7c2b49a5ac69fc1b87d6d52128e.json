{"path":"2025/Summer/POS-101 - Intro to Amer Government/POS-101 - Week 3/POS-101 - Week Three Essay.pdf","text":"In Richard Neustadt's book \"Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents,\" the author claims that the office of the President (of the United States) was designed to be weak, to be an \"invaluable clerk.\" (Neustadt. 7). Neustadt begins Chapter 1 by discussing the enormity of the Office of the President (and it's \"2000 men and women\"). In showing the scope of the office, and then zooming back in to the individual PotUS, he makes a strong statement regarding the gravity and power of the office. He also clearly illustrates how this one individual in our government wears the mantle of responsibility for all 2000 of those staff. \"Presidential on the title page means nothing but the President. Power means his influence.\" (Neustadt. 5). In her NYT article, journalist Anni Karni points out just how much power this seat of government can hold when the circumstances are just right (or just wrong enough). Even in cases where Republican voters are confronted with their own leadership's incompetence—like when Mike Flood was shown to be unaware of a rider on a bill that he had signed that would make drastic cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits—the Republican base, as a whole still expects congress to blindly comply with the President on principal, “He’s pressing Trump’s agenda, it seems like,” Gilbert W. said. “What else can you ask for?” (Karni. 2025) This \"Power to Persuade\" (Truman via Neustadt. 29) was not always the measure and primary tool of a US President. Neustadt points at Calvin Coolidge, and Teddy Roosevelt (amongst others) and remarks that Presidents of their era (from the turn of the century to the midcentury), were judged \"based on their initiatives in economics, or diplomacy or legislation, or in mass communication\" (Nuestadt. 6) and points at the Eisenhower and Truman presidencies as the turning point for how Presidential power began to be judged on how well the man in office wielded influence. Given this shift, and the dramatic acceleration in the potency and efficacy of the current President's power to persuade, combined with his sometimes frightening commitment to the trustee model of representation (\"you elected me, now get out of my way and let me govern\") that he employs, one might be inclined to extend gratitude toward William Marberry for carving out an affordance for the Supreme Court of the US to conduct a Judicial Review in cases where legislative acts were believed to run contrary to the Constitution. Opponents to this incredible power afforded to the court might point to Scott v Stanford as a dark example of the abuses possible with this ability to strike law from the books. While this was absolutely an a miscarriage of justice, Brown vs Board of Education shows that the same power can be used to right a previous wrong, even within the body that failed justice in the past. Given the very recent history of the current (conservative- leaning) Court balancing abuses of PotUS power, I would hesitate to condemn or even criticize the Judicial Review power.
