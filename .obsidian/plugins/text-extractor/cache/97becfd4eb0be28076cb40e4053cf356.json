After discussing the role of context, he describes how oppression emerges from com- plementary frames of reference that promote overadaptation to the dominant culture. He proposes that this diminishes authentic intercultural dialogue. However, greater access to resources can come about by expanding the Adult and emphasizing cultural awareness of self and other. Intercultural clients develop and enhance their resources when they cocreate shared frames of ref- erence and expand their cultural frames of reference while accounting for their individual identity. KEYWORDS Intercultural counseling; frame of reference; culture; racism; privilege; global communities; transactional analysis; intercul- tural competence The last couple of years have been quite formative in my development as a TA practi- tioner and, indeed, as a human being. As a White, Western (Bonnett, 2000, p. 18), edu- cated male in the context of rural Guatemala, I have experienced both privilege, stemming from systemic inequality, and prejudice in individual interactions. When delivering workshops, I might be seen as more knowledgeable and somehow more legitimate than the local people of color. Then again, living in a predominantly indigen- ous town, I belong to the minority. As a White person, I represent a projective screen for the pain stemming from the colonial past of Guatemala. Many people from this town assume that I come from the United States and refer to me as a “gringo,” even though I grew up behind the Iron Curtain of communist Poland. Nonetheless, my edu- cation, my economic situation, and the perceived status that my skin color represents (Dalal, 2002) place me in a bracket of comfort. In fact, by Western standards, I live a simple life. Here in Guatemala the inequality is stark and creates a sense of division that cuts through the fabric of society. I often feel conflicted: Although I disagree with the inequality and am angry at the exploitation of Indigenous people, due to my White privilege (McIntosh, 1992) I have access to a wider range of opportunities. On one occasion, I was bitten by my neighbor’s dog, which led to the comment “Le gusta carne blanca” (“The dog likes white meat”). I told my neighbor politely that I CONTACT Piotr Jusik peter@iflowcoaching.com Rancho Grande, Callej\u0001on Panagas, Panajachel, Solol\u0001a, Guatemala \u0001 2022 International Transactional Analysis Association TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS JOURNAL 2022, VOL. 52, NO. 3, 209–227 https://doi.org/10.1080/03621537.2022.2076981 felt hurt, I was by no means a piece of meat to be consumed, and that we could treat each other with mutual respect. The neighbor first laughed my comment off, but when I insisted that I felt scared when the dog attacked me, she reluctantly apolo- gized. Days after the incident, it dawned on me that my assertive words stemmed from years of therapy as well as “the additional privilege of having studied transac- tional analysis” (Umney & Rassekh, 2018, p. 200), something not available to all. Moreover, I took my safety for granted and did not understand how my neighbor dis- regarded what was the obvious norm in the society in which I grew up. The interaction with my neighbor set me on a quest to explore what happens at the edge of cultures, race, and differences and how that contributes to power dynam- ics. It seemed to me that there were two crucial aspects at play that shaped that situ- ation. First, we were both confused and misunderstood in our intercultural interaction that to me echoed aspects of oppression when she referred to me as “white meat.” What could be funny in one culture can be offensive and derogatory in another because we hold different worldviews. However, I felt within my rights to expect a col- laborative response of compliance to my need for safety, whereas my neighbor may not have given the situation much thought. Second, both of us wanted to feel OK, and yet this was somehow thwarted. Given the colonial past and the brutal history of persecution of Guatemalan Indigenous peoples, my neighbor might have carried some painful memories, anger, and resentment, in and out of awareness, that influenced her response. As a woman of Mayan indigenous (Kaqchiquel) descent and with darker skin, she would regrettably have less power assigned to her in the highly stratified Guatemalan society. On my side, there was a supportive Cultural Parent (Drego, 1983) of transactional analysis that gave validity to my feelings and thoughts. Being White (Naughton & Tudor, 2006) provided me with some authority derived from belonging to what is erroneously per- ceived as the aspirational norm. Then again, as a gay man, I could be seen as inferior in the homophobic Guatemalan society, although I could pass as straight by control- ling my gestures (e.g., not acting too flamboyantly). My neighbor and I were in a con- text that shaped our understanding of each other and our sense of OKness, although at the time we acted automatically and without reflection. On one level, our encounter was individual, on another it was symbolic and repre- sented wider questions. How do we bring meaning and mutual respect into intercul- tural encounters in view of misunderstandings and explicit and implicit systems of oppression that obstruct human communication? If the default position seems to be one of objectification of “the unknown other,” how do we account for the various frames of reference (Schiff et al., 1975, p. 290) that are present in intercultural spaces? In transactional analysis terms, one possible answer might be to establish Adult- Adult (Tudor, 2003) communication from an “I’m OK, You’re OK” position (Ernst, 1971; Park & Kline, 1993). However, what is understood as “Adult” or “OK” will differ from culture to culture. Cultural differences do not inherently have to involve power dynamics but, sadly, they often do as a result of historically influenced social con- structs such as race (Frankenberg, 1999, p. 6). When one culture, usually the dominant one, claims the mandate to define reality and set the norms, then those who do not fit in are likely to feel oppressed or at least marginalized. In contrast, I believe that 210 P. JUSIK creating conditions for genuine OKness starts with an honest and vulnerable engage- ment in “the phenomenological discovery of separateness” (Shadbolt, 2017, p. 269) so that the questions just posed here can be explored and felt by all the par- ties involved. Challenges and Opportunities in Intercultural Spaces Intercultural, cross-cultural, and multicultural counseling are all embedded in a context of cultural diversity. These terms may seem confusing, and there are many definitions available. But for the purposes of this paper, I will clarify my understanding of these terms. Considering the main emphasis of a particular area helps to distinguish it more explicitly. I see the aim of intercultural counseling as enhancing the client’s capacity for inter- cultural sensitivity (Bennett, 2004) and cultural adaptation. There is the development of a shared space that does not belong to either culture but has a new intercultural quality. For instance, a French-Spanish couple living in the United Kingdom might seek intercultural counseling to adjust to the British culture (which includes many local and ethnic subcultures). Cross-cultural counseling is concerned with facilitating deeper understanding across two cultures, taking into account the differences that may arise, for example, when a client and counselor have different cultural backgrounds (e.g., a Polish client receiving counseling from an English practitioner). Identifying what helps or hinders such a pro- cess would be the domain of cross-cultural counseling. The American Psychological Association Dictionary of Psychology (APA, n.d.) describes multicultural therapy as “any form of therapy that assesses, understands, and evaluates a client’s behavior in the multiplicity of cultural contexts (e.g., ethnic, national, demo- graphic, social, economic) in which that behavior was learned and is displayed” (para. 2). Thus, the multiplicity of contexts is emphasized in order to understand the client. Multicultural counseling addresses issues such as identity, race, gender, ethnicity, oppression, immigration, and socioeconomic status as relevant to the needs of the cli- ent, or client group, such as working with a multicultural women’s group in rural Guatemala that supports victims of rape. For such a group, national identity and developing greater intercultural sensitivity are not the main things they need; they are more concerned with understanding women’s circumstances as influenced by multiple cultural contexts so they can support them more effectively. Table 1 summarizes the aims, common counseling situations, and examples related to the terms just discussed. In my experience, when working in intercultural contexts, these distinctions overlap. For example, a German practitioner may assist a German client in their adjustment to another culture (intercultural counseling); a Black French counselor may see British White working-class clients (cross-cultural); and multicultural groups in which a multi- plicity of cultural issues around equality, race, gender, and oppression come to the forefront may be led by a facilitator of dual heritage. The term intercultural spaces characterizes for me the considerations around the various types of counseling in which culture is a significant factor that shapes the process. TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS JOURNAL 211 Over the last 10 years, I have worked in Poland, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Guatemala providing counseling to multifaceted international clients from different cultures and speaking various languages. My interest in intercultural spaces grew from teaching in international schools, moving to the United Kingdom, training in TA as a nonnative speaker of English, and then applying it in quite diverse contexts. The TA counseling field encompasses competencies that can be applied on two levels: as pri- mary counseling (understood as therapeutic counseling in the United Kingdom) and as complementary counseling (which includes coaching, training, and group facilita- tion as well as other uses of counseling skills to enhance the Adult ego state). A counselor has the option of engaging in formal as well as informal roles (Jusik, 2020) to reach a wider range of clients beyond the confines of the consult- ing room and taking into account the contextual circumstances. In my practice, I offer services as a therapeutic counselor and as a coach, group facilitator, and external consultant. When engaging in complementary counseling, I weave in vari- ous TA concepts and skills to create optimal conditions for contract completion, which requires accounting for the context of the individuals and groups that I assist. The common themes for the diverse clients I see revolve around the need for clarification of identity, usually provoked by cultural transition. I understand this as raising client self–awareness of their individual and cultural frames of refer- ence (N.L.James, 1994), which influences available “script options” (Schiff et al., 1975, p. 290). A client’s frame of reference shapes their perception of themselves and others and also determines access to resources (Fassbind-Kech, 2013). If the aim of a TA counselor is to enhance clients’ autonomy in relation to their social, professional, and cultural environment (International Transactional Analysis Association, n.d., Section 5, p. 2), then the considerations around accessing resour- ces is crucial to positive outcomes. Table 1. Distinction Between Intercultural, Cross-Cultural, and Multicultural Counseling.

JUSIK For the purposes of this paper, I frame the issues around cultural differences and systemic oppression as symptoms of an underdeveloped Adult. The ideas presented here can be applied in counseling and psychotherapy with individual clients as well as in educational and organizational group contexts in which culture significantly shapes the process. I am examining the phenomenon of intercultural relating, pulling out common threads that will stimulate TA practitioners from all fields to recognize the impact of culture on their work. Multicultural individuals and groups face both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, they have many resources, most notably their successful integration of the difficulties of culture shock (Cupsa, 2018) that give rise to “a specialized form of learn- ing and educational growth, one that can lead to being able to see ‘the bigger picture’” (p. 186). Thanks to that, this client group often develops greater resilience, openness, and complex thinking as well as compassion and empathy for difference. And yet these resources may be frequently overshadowed by confusion, misunder- standings, implicit power imbalances, frustration, loneliness, and a feeling of being lost in the intricacies of intercultural spaces. As a result, these clients face challenges related to individual and collective performance, communication, and group cohesion (Berne, 1963) as well as establishing personal and professional intimacy. Personally, when meeting clients and groups from other cultures, I am sometimes pre- occupied with whether we will understand each other enough, beyond the projections that may misguide us. As a Polish person, I may feel slightly inadequate in quintessen- tially English-speaking contexts and want to appear as smart and educated to compen- sate for my “Polishness,” which might be associated with class prejudice and stereotypes such as Polish men are builders and handymen in the United Kingdom. On the other hand, when entering a situation as a White person in a multicultural context, I may be blind to the power that comes with my skin color, which I experience as having greater ease. For instance, working as a teacher in the United Kingdom, I always felt I had to prove myself, whereas working at a Guatemalan university I was perceived as know- ledgeable and competent, even though my Spanish still has room for improvement. Thus, the challenges experienced by the practitioner depend on their culture of ori- gin, the relative privilege (Minikin, 2021) assigned to them, and the context of the interaction. The potential threats to successful intercultural dialogue that are likely to emerge include: \u0001 Power dynamics: It is important to ask oneself who holds the power in a given situ- ation. What cultural group is perceived as being the majority? Are there subtle or obvious ways in which the practitioner may perpetuate overadaptation to the dom- inant culture? For example, the counselor could be perceived as less competent due to their skin color or cultural background. There could be implicit competition in a multicultural group to be seen as legitimate. Trew (2002, p. 164) pointed out that when using the term “different” in diversity training, we are implying that there is a norm that one has to adjust to. Awareness of the use and misuse of power helps to promote equality and highlight areas of potential oppression. \u0001 Constructs of self: Western practitioners often emphasize individual feelings, thoughts, and behaviors in the formation of the self, which is not the case in more TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS JOURNAL 213 collectivistic or indigenous cultures. When isolating the well-being of an individual client from the context, professionals may discount the role of family and commu- nity at the expense of belonging. Defining the self as a relational construct enables us to take account of the context: Rather than “have” a “self” we only exist within relationships and can only be described within a context. This challenges a notion we often hold in the helping professions, that difficulties reside within individuals, and that people have discrete internal worlds that have been caused by their life experiences. (Ryde, 2009, p. 121) \u0001 Speech compatibility: The extent to which the client and counselor share language proficiency will contribute to the occurrence of “synchronized exchanges” (Gumperz as cited in Peavy & Li, 2003, p. 190) that are conducive to accurate understanding and rhythmic attunement (Erskine & Trautmann, 1996). The meaning of silence is also culture specific, evoking issues around respect, passivity, and proactivity in con- versation as well as the contemplation needed to take in what is said. \u0001 Cultural attunement: Hoskins (1999) put forward a perspective that recognizes oppression in minority groups and the need for humility, sensitivity, openness, and curiosity vis-\u0003a-vis cultural differences. Learning about the values, beliefs, symbolism, and meaning making of a particular culture will facilitate accurate and respectful understanding. There is also the danger of becoming a detached, misattuned observer when one does not recognize the positional authority of the researcher role. Some individuals, due to their position within systems, may be granted the privilege of interpreting behavior and setting the tone for meaning making in a particular field, which becomes the official narrative. For example, currently I am the only TA practitioner writing about their experience in Guatemala. It is important that I keep an attitude of openness because otherwise, I could superim- pose my experience on Mayan Indigenous people. Their meaning making is likely to be different from mine, and attuning to it with curiosity is fundamental. \u0001 Reductionism: Western counseling theories and practice are products of middle-class edu- cation that cannot be superimposed onto minority cultures (Wohl, 1989). Again, when assuming that particular approaches are universal and applicable to other contexts, pro- fessionals run the risk of misconstruing the client’s world as unsophisticated or uncivilized. Treating problems of a client from a minority group solely as internal and personal to them discounts the significance of the systems of oppression that affect them. In view of these possible threats to meaningful intercultural contact, many psycho- logical practitioners wonder how to promote human dignity and equality. Preventing discriminatory policies to create a robust “I’m OK, You’re OK” environment (Salters, 2006) is crucial. This debate often centers on antioppression initiatives. However, by considering only the challenges and designing preventive measures, we may be at risk of omitting the resources hidden underneath intercultural encounters. There are tre- mendous treasures to be unearthed at the edge of cultures, such as: \u0001 Sense of purpose: Multicultural individuals and groups often espouse humanistic values and seek to have a meaningful impact. \u0001 Global responsibility: Well-integrated intercultural persons care deeply for the world and feel personally responsible for the shape it is in. 214 P. JUSIK \u0001 Reflective engagement: Having lived in a number of countries, global nomads often seek alternatives to the outdated elements of our current systems. \u0001 Ecological awareness: People with extensive intercultural experiences see the world as an interconnected system and tend to make sustainable choices (e.g., reducing flying, eating less meat, etc.). Uncovering, developing, and enhancing psychological resources is particularly needed nowadays as our hyperconnected and increasingly multicultural world faces climate crisis and intensified migration. The idea of coming together as a diverse com- munity is not new, and yet a good deal still remains to be done to challenge the negative impacts of cultural scripting (White & White, 1975, p. 12). I believe that by keeping in mind what can be gained through navigating the systems of oppression created by current sociocultural scripts, we can set up conditions favorable to the emergence of resources in intercultural spaces. As previously indicated in the anecdote about my neighbor’s dog, the context of interaction influences our perception. Cultural differences lead to oppression when one party misuses their power to harm the “other.” Additionally, oppressive dynamics emerge when “the more powerful other” fails to recognize the impact of their relative privilege on the “less-resourced subject” (Minikin, 2021). I propose that identifying the frames of reference that determine the distribution of power in an intercultural setting is a pre- requisite to uncovering resources and preventing oppressive dynamics. Furthermore, to ensure accurate communication, we need to share enough of our frames of reference so that transactions are meaningful. Likewise, accounting for various frames of reference— that is, giving validity to the worldviews of all parties involved—promotes OKness because doing so does not favor one position by making it a universal norm. Dominant Culture as a Context It is important to emphasize that context (Napper, 2010) is intrinsic to a counseling situation and, indeed, plays a role in all fields of TA. This conviction was not always the case as evidenced by these words from Berne: Generally speaking, attempts to relate so-called “cultural” factors to mental illness are open to questions. The current tendency in this direction may be obscuring more important issues. A careful reading of the literature gives the impression that, psychodynamically, culture is on the same level as authointoxication [sic], racial prejudice, and economics. The patient may be only too relieved to blame his troubles on the intestinal system, the social system, or the economic system, and the biased therapist may help him along with this project of finding a scapegoat. … The doctrine that people are victims of their environments is a doubtful ortho-psychiatric position. (Berne, 1960, pp. 1076–1081) He also wrote, “The therapist needs not to be distracted unduly by ‘cultural’ factors, which at the clinical therapeutic level are of relatively little significance” (Berne, 1966, p. 286). Subsequent to Berne, as TA evolved over the years, these views were contested by a number of authors (Batts, 1982, 1983; Drego, 1983, 1996;J. James, 1983; M. James, 1983; Mazzetti, 2010; Roberts, 1975, 1983; Vago, 1977; White & White, 1975). Berne did modify TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS JOURNAL 215 his initial thoughts by pointing out that monuments and public facilities, such as courts, morgues, or gambling houses, carried “the history of human scripts” (Berne, 1972,p.53).In addition, his references to “the family parade” (p. 284) and the influence of inherited ances- tral values on script formation as well as the notion of culture as an interplay of structures and dynamics (Berne, 1963) showed that he started to recognize the significance of the cultural context for an individual. Nonetheless, to some extent, TA, from its inception, oper- ated from a position of detachment that underestimated the power of context and subtly (or perhaps not so subtly) invited adaptation to the dominant culture (J. James, 1983), even though the etiquette of the TA Cultural Parent hinted about universal OKness. Perhaps some of this adaptation is still present in the TA community today. For instance, as a nonnative English speaker attending conferences, I have always been amazed by and slightly envious of the ease that native English speakers experienced. One interpretation, according to Berne, would point toward my personal script flirta- tion with the Victim position (Karpman, 1968) that Berne alluded to when suggesting the possibility of blaming culture for one’s malaise. And yet this linguistic context of the dominant culture seems to imply that the nonnative speaker has to make an effort to be clear, with no such expectation placed on the other party. The language context creates an imbalance of power, even though none of the parties have any intention to oppress the other. This needs to be brought into awareness and accounted for because otherwise it will subtly encourage overadaptation rather than genuine Adult functioning. If the context is not owned by all parties, it will contribute to the underly- ing oppression through “the seduction of normativity” (Minikin, 2021). In my case, once I mastered the English language, I caught myself being impatient with people who did not speak it very well. In my eyes, I became part of the dominant culture, which gave me a sense of OKness and legitimacy that was contextually rein- forced. In some way, I was seduced by the belonging provided by the norm and became absorbed into the mainstream. It seemed as though I had earned the right to be at ease by learning a globally dominant language. On closer look, my impatience covers the dis- avowed non-English-speaking parts of me that feel vulnerable in the international arena. I do not want to be seen as a proverbial “Polack” (derogatory term used in the United States) or a handyman. Then again, as a gay man, I could be perceived as clumsy, so I could not boost my social standing based on the association with tough Polish builders to soothe my repressed feelings of inadequacy. What I had at my disposal was language that would support my image as a clever person. My impatience, and the slightly perse- cutory quality that accompanies it, show how determined one can become to avoid the marginality that comes from nonmainstream characteristics. If I do not take account of this dynamic, I am effectively perpetuating oppression from a one-up position. Thus, when promoting autonomy cross culturally, we need to appreciate the interactions of an individual with a particular context, because otherwise we become cogs in the system that perpetuate the “embedded shadowy fixations” (Napper, 2010, p. 194) that give rise to limiting and discriminatory patterns. How Oppressive Frames of Reference Are Cocreated Schiff and her colleagues (Schiff et al., 1975) defined frame of reference metaphorically as “the skin that surrounds the ego states, binding them together and acting as a filter 216 P. JUSIK on reality” (p. 290). In intercultural encounters, we bring our different filters, which enables us to construct our respective subjective meanings. If there is no shared frame of reference, people tend to feel confused and misunderstood. On the other hand, Harford (2009/2011) stated that when we are in relationship with others and the world – a shared frame of reference instils a feeling of belonging, of sameness and acceptance, an essential normalising function that contributes significantly to a positive ‘stroke bank’… and general psychological good health. (p. 4) This view interprets the original pathology-focused Schiffian concept from a develop- mental and growth-promoting perspective. Tapping into the resources that emerge at the edge of cultures is facilitated when we reach agreement on the relevant aspects of self, other, and the situation. However, how do we decide what is relevant? Who gets to define it? There is a danger of inad- vertently promoting belonging to the dominant culture, and “sameness” could, in effect, mean the perpetuation of systemic oppression. Additionally, the Schiffian model assumes the existence of “a consensually definable reality” (Cornell, 2022, p. 8) as pre- scribed by the therapist and requires the client to adjust their “thinking disorders” (Schiff et al., 1975, pp. 19–22) to emulate the “healthy” frame of reference offered externally. Weiss (1994) pointed out the inherent power imbalance present in this set up, including client dependency and the possibility of exploitation that may result from an uncritical application of the Schiff model. The implication that there exists a particular worldview, seen as the legitimate worldview, echoes an ethnocentric stance (Bennett, 2004) and is counterproductive to intercultural relating. However, I consider the Schiffian model as valid to the extent that it enables me to focus on growth- promoting aspects that enhance the Adult. Clarke (1996) proposed a developmental take on the concept of frame of reference and recognized the significance of cultural change as necessary for appropri- ate adaptation: This is a time of great transition. Technological, economic, philosophic, and locus of power changes intrude on all areas of life and on all areas of one’s frame of reference. This great shake of constant and dramatic change necessitates looking at all areas of a person’s frame of reference in the light of this transition. Old responses to stimuli are often no longer satisfying and comforting. (p. 215) Her words can be equally applied today and to me indicate that it is possible to update TA concepts and adjust them to clinical applications even if the original formu- lations had flaws. I also find hope in Clarke’s words because they underscore the importance of learning, that is, expanding the Adult in order to adapt one’s world- view, which is the beginning of challenging oppressive dynamics. Therefore, I interpret the original Schiffian definition of frame of reference as a structure of associated (con- ditioned) responses that integrate the various ego states in response to specific stim- uli, including culture, which enables the definition of self, other, and the world. When putting this into practice, I may wonder why I feel anxious when I wait for a workshop in Guatemala to start on time when the frame of reference around the notion of time here defines it as more fluid and cyclical than I am used to. Rather TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS JOURNAL 217 than thinking that there is a frame of reference, I believe that there are many frames of reference to be discovered and accounted for in intercultural spaces. The intersubjective approach (Storolow et al., 2002) is a good alternative for work- ing with cultural differences because it emphasizes truth as a construct that emerges from dialogue, giving validity to all parties. Transactional analysts can turn to the cocreative school (Summers & Tudor, 2000) with its emphasis on the cultural context. When cocreating shared frames of reference, we can do so with explicit cultural sensi- tivity, especially taking into account that “dominant cultures make non-dominant cul- tures Not-OK” (J. James, 1983, p. 208). Failure to do so may contribute to creating frames of reference that normalize subtle dynamics of oppression, such as those pre- sent in the apparent linguistic ease of native English speakers and the self-conscious attitude of some nonnative speakers. Working as a teacher and counselor in the United Kingdom, I observed that many nonnative speakers were viewed as less intelli- gent if they had a thick accent. Berne’s(1972) words illustrate the underlying message of having to adapt to the dominant culture: “A German who had been in this country for twenty years and still speaks with a thick accent probably has a less flexible life plan than a Dane who speaks good American after only two years” (p. 53). Could these words possibly reflect the felt internalized oppression of a young Jewish man who felt enticed to change his last name from Bernstein to Berne? Was the context of antisemitism so insidious that it was best to fit in to minimize pain? We do not know, of course, but it perhaps shows how we can be easily coerced to overadapt to the frame of reference represented by the majority. It seems that by default many of us are scripted into an ethnocentric stance defined by dominant cultures. In such cases, there is less room for negotiation and less possibility of meaningful intercul- tural dialogue. At the individual level, cocreation can both confirm and disconfirm script issues. Thus, systemically, we can both perpetuate oppression and foster the possibility of change. The question becomes what is the principal force? The newly cocreated shared frames of reference can be complementary and re-create familiar oppressive dynamics as opposed to giving rise to fresh and inclusive meanings. That is why the awareness of what we bring personally into an intercultural encounter enables us to own our part of the cocreation. Mazzetti (2010) pointed out that one might unwit- tingly perceive one’s own frame of reference as universal and therefore exclude others: Identifying the frame of reference of our own culture, our own cultural parameters, gives us permission to promote cross-cultural communication and to let our clients teach us their cultural points of reference. In other words, trying to include others in our frame of reference (thinking of it as a universal value) is a main obstacle in cross-cultural professional relationships. (p. 191) Recognizing and owning one’s culture as a pattern in the context of many alterna- tives promotes mutual empathetic understanding and paves the way toward nonop- pressive relating. This is only possible if we look at our own frames of reference from both outside and within through a mutual exploration of self and other that gives rise to a metaperspective. We can then be more alert to whether the cocreation is likely to result in oppression. I believe that through an ongoing exploration that questions the 218 P. JUSIK “organizing principles” (Stolorow & Atwood, 1992, p. 33) of the respective cultures we are more likely to challenge and disconfirm what stands in the way of meaningful intercultural dialogue. Let us consider racism, which Batts (1982) diagrammed as a double contamination by introjected Parent prejudice toward “the other” along with Child delusions (coupled affect) such as fear of “the other.” From a cocreative perspective, the prejudice and delusions would be seen as “pathological in so far as they are compulsively used in the here and now at the expense of excluding other choices” (Summers & Tudor, 2000, p. 35). I believe that cocreation confirms oppressive dynamics when the mean- ing making resulting from the interaction upholds the beliefs stemming from errone- ous and harmful sociocultural scripts. The following description shows how oppressive frames of reference are cocreated when the integrating Adult (Tudor, 2003) is under- developed in a particular context. In my work in Guatemala, I bring the contextual notions of White supremacy as inherited from my predominantly monocultural Polish upbringing along with appre- hension toward people of color. I believe that my negative attitudes and feelings are covered by the fantasy of being a “White savior.” As for Guatemalans, they might idealize me, perceiving themselves as inferior, resenting my privilege, and resisting while experiencing shame. Again, it seems likely that Guatemalans compensate for their sense of inferiority through reverence for their indigenous roots, adding a myth- like narrative of exceptionalism to their self-perception. Additionally, I also carry repressed shame and guilt as a beneficiary of cultural, social, and economic forces that unjustifiably favor White people. For their part, the pain, humiliation, and fear that the Guatemalans face is walled off, leaving them numb and disenfranchised. Figure 1 shows how oppressive frames of reference are cocreated when Parent prejudice and Child delusions are complementary. There is no shared area, and the Figure 1. Cocreation of Oppressive Frames of Reference. TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS JOURNAL 219 transactional vectors become redefined to confirm the views held about self, other, and the world. Oppressive frames of reference lead to discounting of the significance of context and privilege in the service of maintaining discriminatory and outdated beliefs, thereby justifying the Parental prejudice and the Child delusions derived from culture. In an ideal world, the counselor meets the client with a robust integrating Adult that enables the counselor to identify and reflect on their “pathological” prejudice and delusions that give rise to oppression. However, given that projections are unavoid- able, it is not possible not to have assumptions about the other because our percep- tual systems emerge in our respective cultural contexts. That is why staying inquisitive about one’s contribution to the cocreation and sensitive to the emerging frame of ref- erence are necessary for appropriate integration. Expanding Cultural Frames of Reference The process of agreeing on a common frame of reference is only one aspect of creat- ing conditions favorable to the emergence of resources. Each individual involved in an intercultural encounter also holds a cultural frame of reference (CFR) defined as a subsystem of the individual frame of reference. The CFR is the primary source of one’s personal social identity and provides each person with many kinds of social cognitions with which to integrate ego state responses to intergroup exchanges and encounters. (N. L. James, 1994, p. 206) If the frame of reference is compared to the “skin” surrounding ego states, I would then describe the CFR as muscles that through learned reflexes of muscular memory respond in set ways, dictated by the Parent in the Child (P1) cultural injunctions, Parent ego state (P2) content, and somatic Child (C1) affirmation. The CFR leads to rigid categorizations, such as “us” and “them,” and thus reinforces our membership in the groups to which we belong, for instance, nationality or race. N. L. James (1994) suggested that the very existence of these systems of categorization is sufficient to induce discrimination when we favor our in-group. The extent to which a particular social category (e.g., gender or ethnic group) is important to our sense of self-worth and OKness determines the extent to which that category shapes our responses dur- ing an intercultural encounter. Some aspects of self will gain particular significance and create the patterns of intergroup communication. For instance, a multicultural group of women supporting victims of rape in rural Guatemala would primarily respond from their gender identity, and issues around nationality would not necessarily come to the forefront. On the other hand, a person belonging to the dominant culture—whether White, English speaking, or heterosexual—could appraise their category of membership as not particularly significant and discount the impact of their privilege that comes from being part of “the norm.” By pinpointing the specific social categories that mold our perceptions and responses, one can be more alert to the blind spots that interfere with meaningful intercultural dialogue. As mentioned earlier, I find myself oblivious at times to the ease that comes with my skin color and do not consider it explicitly. Part of my learn- ing edge is to expand my CFR to include awareness of my Whiteness and its impact 220 P. JUSIK on my clients so that my belonging to a dominant culture or category does not exclude others. To preserve and honor the respective identities of all parties involved in a relation- ship, we need to account for the various CFRs. Otherwise, we run the risk of promot- ing excessive homonomy in the name of cultural adaptation. Focusing solely on cocreating shared frames of reference is equivalent to the “melting pot” metaphor or, even more brutally put, a “smoothie” in which individual proclivities might be lost. Expanding the CFR is achieved by incorporating alternative cultural worldviews as an extension of one’s beliefs and attitudes, without losing one’s primary cultural identity. Notably, accounting for issues related to constructs of self, speech compatibility, cul- tural attunement, and the dangers of reductionism can guide the facilitator’s inquiry toward more effective intercultural dialogue. Taking care to preserve the various CFRs fosters appreciation of everyone’s distinctive circumstances and points of view, which, in turn, gives everyone ownership over their resources. Such an environment becomes more inclusive and invites the mutual adjustment of dominant and nondomi- nant cultures. The elements of establishing conditions favorable to the emergence of resources in intercultural spaces are represented visually in Figure 2. We need to start with the awareness of the context so that we know how the scene is set even before we enter it with any contracting or interventions. Cocreating shared frames of reference sup- ports clear communication and models inclusive dialogue. Consideration given to the distribution of power, which unfortunately sometimes results in inequality, is crucial to challenging oppressive dynamics. Bringing awareness of privilege to the conversation does not necessarily change the unfair treatment, but it makes the inequality more explicit and therefore creates some accountability. Expanding the CFRs to include the understanding of “the other” helps to dissolve the projections that interfere with meaningful contact. All in all, this is about enhancing the integrating Adult so that Figure 2. Conditions Favorable to Developing Resources Interculturally (adapted from Berne, 1972; Woollams & Brown as cited in Harford, 2009/2011, p. 7; N. L. James, 1994). TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS JOURNAL 221 Parental prejudice and Child delusions are appropriately reflected on “in the service of present-centred relating” (Tudor, 2003, p. 202). Case Vignette An organization asked me to work with their multicultural team, which included peo- ple from seven different cultures, including the United States, Mexico, Guatemala (Kaqchiquel, Tzutujil, and Ladino), Argentina, and Italy. I was contracted as a group facilitator to provide complementary counseling that aimed to enhance the resources of the client system and increase individuals’ levels of autonomy in terms of their pro- fessional roles. The group was frustrated because many tasks were not getting done, and their communication was unclear. They also did not have a shared frame of reference for problem solving and effective communication. When delivering workshops, I was rarely challenged. For the first several months, the participants did not speak much, which I interpreted as passivity (Schiff & Schiff, 1971). Although I intended to maintain a consistently reflective stance, there were moments when I subtly infantilized the group. For instance, when talking about interventions, my supervisor pointed out that I used diminutives in a couple of transactions describing the team. Additionally, the exercises I proposed were more about instructing that facilitating. I and the group cocreated an oppressive frame of reference in which I was likely to redefine the group’s ineffective communication as an invitation to guide them (my Parent prejudice concerning the lack of capability of the other). They redefined my assertive style as an invitation to adapt (Child delusion about lack of potency). Despite pledging allegiance to the principles of OKness and equality, my unconscious notions of superiority seeped out. Our respective frames of reference were complementary and re-created oppression of a familiar neocolonial flavor. Being blind to the projections that my Whiteness would evoke as well as ignoring its impact on the group process, I did not take sufficient account of our cocreated dynamics. We got stuck. How could I promote an inclusive environment when some part of me conceived of me as a more capable White savior? I wanted to include “the other” in my frame of reference by holding on to the predictability of my meaning making and avoiding the discomfort of cocreation. I felt ashamed and embarrassed about my reductionist posture and lack of cultural attunement, wanting to escape my Whiteness in some way. I wanted to believe that the notions of White supremacy were outside of me and wished to portray myself as a fair social activist, immune to the impact of the system. Sitting with my self-disap- pointment, I gradually regained my capacity to think. The new exercises I designed were based on group-led curious exploration. I invited the team to create a piece of art in response to the question “What does it mean for you to be human?” I introduced the activity playfully, stating that we all have a limited time on this planet and need to think carefully about how we want to use it. The group had 5 minutes to discuss and agree on a vision for their piece of art. I stayed silent while everyone had three opportunities to speak. I wanted the group to recognize whether their exchanges were synchronized, sufficiently detailed (or 222 P. JUSIK overdetailed), and accurate. Then the group started making a piece of art together. However, it turned out that they had not established a clear vision for their piece. Once they were done, I asked them what they noticed in relation to their process. Their words included the following: \u0001 “Not everyone took the opportunity to speak.” \u0001 “Some people were shy at first, sitting, looking, and doing nothing.” \u0001 “We did not agree on a vision and then carried out the exercise in silence.” \u0001 “There were moments when we were in tune, even when we did not speak.” \u0001 “We drew on our resources as a group, but we could have done more.” \u0001 “Some people lost interest and did not listen to others.” \u0001 “People mostly did their individual pieces without connection to each other.” \u0001 “Our silence indicated intimacy and warmth.” \u0001 “We first acted and then spoke about it afterward.” After writing down their observations on the board, I asked the participants how these mirrored their communication issues. They looked startled at first, but after pon- dering this confrontation (Berne, 1966), we began to discuss the significance of their behavior. Coming from a collectivistic culture (Hofstede, 2011), they preferred to peacefully blend in with the group instead of taking a stand. Rather than naming the behaviors as “passive” from a Western perspective, we explored what the silence meant to them. Some people mentioned that they were not naturally inclined to speak up, others admitted that they were afraid their opinions would be brushed off. Most importantly, the observations came from the group and gave the participants a felt sense of their redefining when they did not agree on a common vision for their piece of art. The underlying process was about me owning my tendency to infantilize the group (e.g., by categorizing their behaviors as “passive”) and the team thinking about the significance of their group dynamics. The neutrality of the intervention, based on curi- osity, enabled the members to also own their resources and strengths, such as warmth, creativity, tolerance, empathy, and the capacity to inspire each other. As a result of this group cocreation, the team understood that they did not take enough time for planning and organizing their work. In this process, a common frame of refer- ence emerged from shared values, such as appreciation of diversity, creativity, and visionary thinking. In the next workshop, there was more participation from the group members, and they began to agree on concrete agreements concerning work tasks. I then asked each participant to name a communication issue that was related to the observations they had made in our previous session. Everyone had three pieces of paper on which to state a problem, its cause, and the effect it had on the organization. I then col- lected their papers and anonymously read them out in the relevant order. For every problem, its cause, and its effect, the participants were asked to put their thumbs up if they agreed, point down if they disagreed, and put their hand horizontally to indi- cate a maybe. With each problem, I deliberately paused and invited the participants to notice their colleagues’ point of view. Rather than expecting the group to come to an TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS JOURNAL 223 agreement, I facilitated their mutual recognition, accounting for their different cultural frames of reference. We cocreated a permissive environment in which to hold our multiplicities in mind and heart. When the group imago reached the secondarily adjusted stage (Berne, 1963; Clarkson, 1991), I gradually removed myself from taking a central position and pre- pared exercises that were group led to a much greater extent, such as presentations and mutual feedback. This multicultural team not only agreed on a shared frame of reference with regard to communication but also expanded their respective cultural frames of reference to include the categories of “the other.” Metaphorically speaking, we were more of a fruit salad than a smoothie. My intention was to preserve the notion of individuality so that personal responsibility in terms of communication and the corresponding professional tasks would crystallize rather than becoming diluted in the collective. I wanted to do so with cultural attunement, inviting discussion about the meaning of personal responsibility. We finished our work moved by our perspec- tives and with a silent feeling of being understood. Conclusion Several months have passed since the incident with my neighbor’s dog, and these days when I walk through the back alley leading to my house, her dog is kept expli- citly close to her so that I am not bitten. We greet each other cordially and sometimes exchange pleasantries. We do not have to be the best of friends, and despite our dis- tinct contexts, levels of privilege granted by society, and seemingly distant frames of reference, we can somehow relate. We represent two separate systems of meaning making that overlap to a certain extent. If the frames of reference that any number of parties bring to an intercultural encounter were to be considered as a collection of information about self, other, and the world, including the resources available, then it seems logical that by expanding the shared areas we increase our access to resources. Kurt G€odel, an Austrian logician, mathematician, and philosopher, put forward two incompleteness theorems by which he pointed out that we cannot completely ascertain whether something is true or false within a closed system and that the system cannot itself prove that it is consist- ent (Raatikainen, 2020). There is a need to look from beyond to really see what is within. We need each other because our perspectives will always be incomplete. The more perspectives we include in our frames of reference, the greater the shared areas and the smaller the psychological distance between the representatives of various cultures. And yet, the expansion cannot be too drastic because it threatens the coherence of the self. I am sure that many readers who have lived in multiple countries might share my sense of feeling periodically lost in the world. There is a price to pay for being an intercultural nomad, just as there is a price to pay for never venturing into the unknown. Thankfully, the spectrum between the extremes of hard-line ethnocentrism and liberal ethnorelativism is wide enough to enable each one of us to find a place in the world. Where would yours be? 224 P.
