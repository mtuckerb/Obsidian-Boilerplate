Mailing Address: Hours of Operation: Release of Information Department Monday – Friday: 8:00AM – 4:00PM Atrius Health 1177 Providence Hwy Telephone and Fax Numbers: Norwood, MA 02062 Tel: 781-292-7700 Fax: 617-421-2626 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Q. How do I obtain a copy of my medical records? A. You may access and request records be sent to you via our secure patient portal, MyHealth.Your health information is available 24/7 to view, download, print and request. Simply log into your MyHealth account and complete the Medical Record Request form. Once processed, you will receive a notification that you have a New MyHealth message. If you do not have a MyHealth account or are authorizing us to send records to a third-party, you may request your records in writing by submitting the completed authorization form on the next page. A completed copy of our authorization form should accompany this FAQ sheet, and can also be downloaded from our website https://www.atriushealth.org/patient- information/access-your-medical-records. Your request should be mailed or faxed to the address above or emailed to medicalrecords@atriushealth.org.Please note that should you email your request, we cannot guarantee your email will be secure.  In most cases, patients 18 years or older must sign their own authorization unless a court has appointed the patient a legal guardian or representative. Proof of legal authority/representation is required. Requests for Billing information, Pharmacy records, and/or Radiology Images/Films must be made directly to each of those departments Q. Is there a cost to obtain a copy of my medical records? A. There is no charge for requests requested and delivered via MyHealth. Other requests are charged a reasonable cost-based fee for producing and sending copies of medical records pursuant to HIPAA 45 CFR 164.524 and Massachusetts law. Often, an Abstract is sufficient for most patient needs. An Abstract consists of your immunizations, problem list, past medical history, 3 years of office/telehealth visits, lab and diagnostic test results. If you want your entire record or more than an Abstract mailed to you, the rate may increase proportionately and will include postage costs for mailing. Q. How can I submit my payment? A. For requests for delivery other than via MyHealth, you will receive an invoice mailed from our copy service, Sharecare, shortly after we receive and process your request. Payment must be received by Sharecare prior to the release of your records. Q. How soon can I expect the release of my medical record to be completed? A. Processing time varies depending on the type of request and method of delivery. Requests via MyHealth are usually prepared and released within 3 business days. Other routine requests are usually prepared within 7 business days and released upon receipt of payment. Please note there are instances where a request may take longer to process. The following scenarios are the most common requiring additional time to process: Requests containing information under the ‘Information Requiring Specific Consent’ box of the authorization form where the appropriate box was not initialed may take longer because we must redact the information needing specific consent. Requests for copies of Behavioral Health records that are being released directly to the patient take longer because we are required by law to obtain clinician approval prior to releasing. Information prior to 2010 may be delayed because we may need to retrieve a paper chart from storage.
