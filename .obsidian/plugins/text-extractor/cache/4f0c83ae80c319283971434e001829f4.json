In keeping with the profession’s social justice mandate and anti-oppressive principles, it is fundamental for emerging social workers to begin the life-long learn- ing process of developing a congruent composite of awareness, values, knowledge and skills essential for working effectively across diverse social locations and intersec- tional identities. Grounded in a social justice framework, this article engages critically with the concept of cultural competence in social work pedagogy, explores the signifi- cance of diversity and intersectionality in social work education and proposes a multi- dimensional model for teaching, learning and evaluating cross-cultural sensitivity and responsivity in the social work class-room.

Whether at the individual, family, group, organisation or commu- nity level of practice, it is fundamental for emerging social workers to begin the ongoing process of developing and demonstrating a compli- mentary blend of cross-cultural awareness, values, knowledge and skills necessary to work effectively across diverse social locations and intersec- tional identities. The manner and degree to which social work education fosters cultural sensitivity and responsivity and the extent to which it successfully translates into professional practice, however, continue to be pivotal issues with which students and educators grapple. Grounded in a social justice framework, this article engages critically with the concept of cultural competence in Canadian and international pedagogy, explores the significance of diversity and intersectionality in social work education, and proposes approaches to teaching, learning and evaluating cross-cultural practice in the social work class-room. To this end, I draw upon my personal and professional experiences as a white woman with mostly privileged and some subjugated positionalities, a social work course instructor at graduate and undergraduate levels, a former student with more than a decade of learning within schools of so- cial work and a social work clinician–researcher in Canadian academic and health care settings; the invaluable lessons passed down from social work colleagues and mentors; and the vast education literature interro- gating cross-cultural social work. While emanating from a Canadian so- cial work context, the learnings and teachings imparted here have international relevance and applicability. Cultural diversity in Canadian social work Culture can be understood broadly as encompassing the many intersect- ing axes of human identity: historical and contemporary, visible and in- visible, static and fluid, assigned and chosen, individually constructed and socially constructed, majority and minority, privileged and oppressed. Contextually and temporally situated and highly influential in shaping worldviews and experiences, culture embodies such things as race, ethnicity, nationality, geography, immigration status, language, reli- gion, spirituality, age, health, ability, gender identity, sexual orientation, family structure, political affiliation and socio-economic status, as well as shared values, beliefs, customs and artefacts. This expanded conceptuali- sation represents a departure from earlier unidimensional definitions that restricted culture to outward manifestations of one’s being. It appre- ciates how multiple overlapping identities, rooted in Crenshaw’s (1989) Cross-Cultural Social Work Education 465Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 prism of intersectionality and analysis of power, impact the ways in which each individual is seen, heard, understood and treated. The multicultural landscape in Canada is vast and continually expand- ing. Though not without a shameful history with devastating and lasting effects (see Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, 2015), modern-day Canada has been recognised internationally for welcoming diversity. Of the total population in recent years, approximately 5 per cent identify as Indigenous, 22 per cent as visible minorities, 17 per cent as seniors, 14 per cent as living with a disability and 3 per cent as gay, lesbian or bisexual (Statistics Canada, 2012–2016). Moreover, one in seven report living in low-income households (Statistics Canada, 2015), with Indigenous peoples, persons of colour, new immigrants and refu- gees, those with disabilities, single seniors, and racialised women and children most at risk for poverty (Canada Without Poverty, 2018; Colour of Poverty, 2019). This diverse demographic profile mirrors the cultural backgrounds of social work service users in Canada, with each intersecting category of identity existing along a socially constructed continuum of privilege and oppression. Where one falls along this dynamic spectrum of power can greatly influence societal judgments of virtue and worth, as well as ac- cess to resources and opportunities. Minority and subjugated groups con- tinue to face discrimination, marginalisation, exclusion and uneven social, economic and health outcomes within Eurocentric systems of ser- vice delivery (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009; Mikkonen and Raphael, 2010). Service user satisfaction and retention, therapeutic alliance and intervention success can hinge on the cultural responsiveness of the ser- vice provider (Davis, 2007; Lee, 2011). It is for these reasons that mind- ful attention to culture and a capacity to work effectively and ethically across differences bear such significance in social work. Diversity is also reflected amongst social work faculty and students, though to a lesser degree as a function of systemic and structural bar- riers. In conflict with the profession’s values and ethics espousing social inclusion and equity, institutions of higher learning in social work remain predominantly white with culturally hegemonic teachings, an unsettling reality that has been acknowledged and challenged (Askeland and Payne, 2006; Jeyapal and Bhuyan, 2016). Engrained in the core princi- ples guiding the Canadian Association for Social Work Education’s (CASWE, 2014) Accreditation Standards for undergraduate and gradu- ate programmes in Canada, similar to other parts of the world, is the ex- plicit support for diversity and social justice, including recruitment efforts and requisite learning objectives. This sentiment is echoed in codes of ethics and standards of practice across professional associations and regulatory bodies (e.g. Canadian Association of Social Workers, 2005; Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers, 2008). Despite being unequivocally recognised and embraced as 466 Corry AzzopardiDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 imperative to social work education and practice, the necessary yet com- plex goals of learning and teaching cultural competence remain rather elusive and contentious. Shifting paradigms of cultural competence in education and practice There have been hundreds of conceptual and operational definitions of cultural competence, and analogous terms such as multiculturalism, pre- sented in the literature (Boyle and Springer, 2001). It is a loaded con- cept fraught with epistemological and practical tensions. Emerging from a synthesis of themes cutting across definitions, cultural competence is best understood as an ongoing developmental process whereby one ac- tively gains congruent values, knowledge and skills to be able to work sensitively, effectively and equitably across cultural differences and power imbalances in the context of responsive organisations and institu- tions (Azzopardi and McNeill, 2016). In line with social work’s person- in-environment lens, this multilevel definition locates cultural compe- tence beyond a static characteristic of the individual care provider to in- clude the systems and structures within which they operate. Human diversity content has not always been a priority in social work academia, where dominant discourse has historically reinforced cultural assimilation and deficit perspectives. Frameworks for understanding, teaching and practicing cultural competence have evolved considerably over time. Marking a shift from previous colour-blind ideals, early multi- cultural education promoted the acquisition of prerequisite cultural in- formation about the ‘other’ and sensitivity to cultural differences (Nadan and Ben-Ari, 2013). With their roots in modernism, early cul- tural literacy models focused predominantly on the attainment of culture-specific knowledge, namely the shared traits of a particular ethno-racial group, and the corresponding application of culture-specific skills and interventions (Dyche and Zayas, 1995). When operating from the positivist assumption that culture is reasonably stable and knowable, culture could, in theory, be proficiently defined, predicted and learned. Traditional approaches have since been recognised as impracticable and challenged for their fixed and monolithic stance on culture, overgenerali- sation of groups as homogenous, disregard of within-group differences and intersectional identities, perpetuation of stereotyping and othering, assumption of workers being from the dominant culture, disconnect from the socio-political environment, inattention to structural power dif- ferentials and neglect of social change agendas (Dean, 2001; Williams, 2006; Este, 2007; Kohli et al., 2010; Nadan and Ben-Ari, 2013). With a deeper appreciation for the complexity of culture emerged a more nuanced understanding of cross-cultural practice. While most Cross-Cultural Social Work Education 467Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 frameworks for working with diverse populations still consider cultural awareness, knowledge and skills as the trifecta of core competencies (Sue et al., 1996; Lum, 2011; National Association of Social Workers, 2015; Sue and Sue, 2015), social work pedagogy has largely moved away from essentialist perspectives on culture to embrace social constructivist, postmodern and critical paradigms. The knowability of another’s culture and achievability of competence have been highly contested suppositions (Dean, 2001; Johnson and Munch, 2009; Ben-Ari and Strier, 2010; Fisher-Borne et al., 2015). The language of cultural competence is recog- nised as inherently problematic in that the notion of one acquiring com- petence in another’s ever-evolving culture is a misnomer (Dean, 2001). Moreover, when self is situated as the norm and other is delegated to different, the focus on competence as an attainable set of skills, knowl- edge and attitudes diverts attention away from structural and institu- tional relations of power and oppression. Most contemporary formulations of cultural competence in social work are built upon collective philosophical assumptions: reality is so- cially constructed; multiple realities shape individual personalities; di- verse worldviews should be appreciated; diversity education has a positive effect; cultural competence entails life-long learning; and com- petency requires knowledge about diversity and oppression, empathy and communication skills, and congruent intrinsic values (Este, 2007; Kohli et al., 2010). The social work literature is rich with alternative and complementary approaches to traditional notions of cultural compe- tence, including anti-oppressive and structural practice (Shera, 2003; Sakamoto, 2007a,b; Laird, 2008; Parrott, 2009; Dumbrill and Yee, 2018; Mullaly and West, 2018), cultural humility (Ortega and Faller, 2011; Fisher-Borne et al., 2015), critical multiculturalism (Nylund, 2006; Daniel, 2008), informed not-knowing (Laird, 2000; Dean, 2001), intersec- tionality (Jani et al., 2011; Robinson et al., 2016; Case, 2017), and cul- tural consciousness (Azzopardi and McNeill, 2016; Pitner and Sakamoto, 2016). In our critical approach to working effectively across differences in social work, for example, we interrupted dominant discourse on quan- tifiable competence and proposed an integrative framework for cultural consciousness grounded in a postmodern epistemic frame (Azzopardi and McNeill, 2016). Foundations of teaching and learning to work effectively across intersectional identities It is the responsibility of social work educators to guide students through the beginning and continuing phases of developing cultural responsivity as they move towards micro, mezzo and macro levels of professional practice. In accordance with the CASWE’s (2014) core learning 468 Corry AzzopardiDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 objectives, students must be prepared to recognise diversity as valuable, and equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively identify, criti- cally assess and work to end oppressive social conditions. This is no small feat, and for some, will require a fundamental transformation in how they understand and relate to the world around them. Moreover, the delivery of cultural competence education can be hindered by degree of student readiness, instructor preparedness, and resistance to the mate- rial by both (Abrams and Moio, 2009; Razack, 2009). These barriers can, however, be effectually mitigated. To this end, teaching and learn- ing cross-cultural social work will be examined across five key domains: (i) teaching for transformative learning about culture and diversity; (ii) sharing evidence-based knowledge, critical frameworks and ethical prin- ciples; (iii) promoting inclusive class-rooms and teachable moments; (iv) fostering critical thinking, self-reflection and cultural humility; and (v) evaluating cross-cultural awareness and responsiveness. Together, these five integrated dimensions offer a solid foundation for a critical intersec- tional framework for cross-cultural social work education. Teaching for transformative learning about culture and diversity Social work programmes vary considerably in their philosophies, struc- tures and methods for teaching cultural competence. Some offer courses on specific aspects of diversity, oppression and social justice, while others infuse this content throughout generalist curricula and field prac- tica. There are advantages and disadvantages to specific and generic approaches related to extent of coverage and depth of learning, and therefore most programmes aim to integrate both (Anastas, 2010; Pitner et al., 2018). Regardless of approach, institutions can prioritise efforts to advance cultural sensitivity through the implementation of anti-oppressive policies and practices, visual displays signalling respect for diversity, re- cruitment and retention of diverse faculty and student bodies, sustained professional development opportunities, steadfast commitment by instruc- tors to continually engage in their own cross-cultural learning, committees to spearhead diversity and equity activities, and collaboration with commu- nity partners locally and globally (Saunders et al.,2015). Faculties must systematically and critically examine curriculum design and course material for reinforcement of dominant cultural paradigms and privileged ways of knowing, teaching and learning. This may entail actively seeking out and integrating non-traditional sources and counter- hegemonic forms of knowledge. Daniel (2008) proposes eight core themes to guide curricular development in critical multicultural educa- tion: culture, race and racism, oppression, multiple identities, power, whiteness and privilege, historical context, and social change. This cur- riculum can thrive in a stimulating environment that supports critical Cross-Cultural Social Work Education 469Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 engagement with cultural discourse and constructive exchange of ideas. Firmly rooted in the position that differences are necessary for vibrant and healthy class-rooms and societies, inclusive teaching requires an open, accepting and respectful attitude. Educators can inspire students to actively partake in learning by enthusiastically and authentically shar- ing their own cross-cultural experiences and voicing their commitment to cultural responsiveness in practice and pedagogy. Students may come to the class-room with different learning styles and capacities (Kolb, 1984), thus calling for a balanced array of accessi- ble teaching methods. Unlike some other courses, teaching cross-cultural social work is not restricted to transmitting expert knowledge from in- structor to student. Traditional didactic instruction falls short of advanc- ing meaningful cultural dialogue. Optimal approaches to teaching tap into cognitive, affective and behavioural dimensions of learning. The lit- erature is replete with curricular examples to maximise learning about diversity (Ellsworth, 1989; Razack, 1999; Akamatsu, 2000; Cramer et al., 2012; Warde, 2012; Block et al., 2016; Pitner and Sakamoto, 2016; Robinson et al., 2016; Alvarez-Hernandez and Choi, 2017; Case, 2017; Dessel and Rodenborg, 2017; Pulliam, 2017; Bennett et al., 2018; Sherwood et al., 2018; Vasquez et al., 2019), some with promising empiri- cal evidence of effectiveness. Two methods believed to bring about transformative learning are reflective discourse and critical self- reflection (Blunt, 2007). These themes are echoed by Nicotera and Kang (2009), who suggest three teaching strategies to expand students’ critical consciousness of privilege and oppression, each building on the other. First, based on the post-colonial theoretical concept of the centre/margin binary, where centre is the norm and other is consigned to the margin, de-centring is a teaching strategy that encourages students to question and destabilise normative notions of culture and their underlying power dynamics. The second teaching strategy involves students critically exam- ining their own privileged identities, how unearned privileges have benefitted their lives, how their privileges will influence practice, and ways they can change the systems that oppress those who do not share their privileges. The third teaching strategy is designed to disrupt privi- lege and oppression in research and practice by examining the social construction of knowledge that constitutes practice. Students’ critical consciousness is facilitated via critical analyses of readings, interactive lectures, individual reflective exercises, small group activities and large group discussions and debates (Nicotera and Kang, 2009). Social work education in cross-cultural practice must also move be- yond the class-room to include experiential learning opportunities that bring the abstract to life, such as simulated interviews and field educa- tion, social work’s signature pedagogy (Wayne et al., 2010). Immersive experiences enable students to apply their knowledge and values and practice their skills in cross-cultural encounters. Engaging directly with 470 Corry AzzopardiDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 communities offers another path towards decolonising social work peda- gogy. Modelling cultural responsiveness in action, Bennett et al. (2018), for example, collaborated with Aboriginal community members and Elders to co-construct curricula using case studies integrating traditional ways of knowing, being and doing. Sharing evidence-based knowledge, critical frameworks and ethi- cal principles The acquisition of a specific knowledge base for all cultures is an unreal- istic and unnecessary goal in social work education. It is unrealistic be- cause individuals present with unique lived experiences, within-group differences, varied degrees of internalisation and acculturation, and mul- tiple social locations. It is unnecessary because operating from a place of informed not-knowing encourages us to embrace uncertainty and seek cultural understanding directly from our service users with an open and curious mind, hence avoiding generalisations and stereotypes (Dean, 2001). The application of evidence-based knowledge about culture, how- ever, can be highly valuable to practice, assuming truth claims are criti- cally interrogated and not universalised. Foundational knowledge of grand explanatory narratives, historical and contemporary social injusti- ces, capitalism, neoliberalism, globalisation, colonialism, imperialism, structural power inequalities, and resulting disparities across cultures is a salient component of cultural competence education. In the Canadian context, for instance, teaching must address the injustices of Canada’s colonial history, continuing colonisation efforts and the self- determination of Indigenous peoples (CASWE, 2014). This implies prob- lematising, unpacking and undoing its harmful effects, with attention paid to the role of populist media and institutional discourses in the so- cial construction of difference and inequity. Theoretical knowledge helps students make sense of cultural construc- tions and provides a framework for cross-cultural social work practice. Williams (2006) argues that any one epistemology of cultural competence should not be rigidly adhered to over all others. Whether post-positivism, constructivism, critical or postmodern, paradigms should be appraised for strengths and limitations, and applied as entry points to practice based on specific need and context in collaborationwithservice users. They can pro- vide scaffolding for methods of clinical intervention, social action and re- search into the effectiveness of culturally responsive education and interventions, therefore linking multilevel practice, theory and research. There is growing momentum for teaching social work through an intersectional lens (Jani et al., 2011; Robinson et al., 2016). Effective intersectional pedagogy emphasises the multiple positioning of individu- als in the social world, and the interactional effects of power, privilege Cross-Cultural Social Work Education 471Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 and oppression manifesting from diverse identities (Case, 2017). This paradigm moves away from monolithic views of culture and binary social categories, thus better appreciating the uniqueness and complexity of intersecting identities, visible and invisible, and their consequences. Detracting students from losing sight of interlocking oppressions, how- ever, may run the risk of diluting discrete effects. The infusion of critical race discourse in diversity education challenges the equalisation of oppressions, which unintentionally reinforces colour-blindness and dif- fuses institutionalised racism (Razack and Jeffery, 2002; Abrams and Moio, 2009; Ortiz and Jani, 2010; Pulliam, 2017). The pursuit of social justice and culturally responsible practice are inex- tricably linked, making an anti-oppressive frame vital. Anti-oppressive practice concentrates on changing the structural relations of power that un- derlie oppression and manifest as personal struggles. Sakamoto (2007a,b) advocates for a re-visioning of cultural competence grounded in anti- oppressive principles and an openness to different ways of knowing. Social work has historically taken on a post-colonial character (Askeland and Payne, 2006). The profession was mostly built upon white Eurocentric knowledge, theories and values. Our understanding of problems and frameworks for helping are filtered through this narrow lens, consequently failing to fully appreciate and meet the needs of those who are othered. An anti-oppressive approach to cultural competence disputes and decolo- nises dominant knowledge, organisations and systems (Williams, 2003; Sakamoto, 2007b). To illustrate, some schools of social work in Canada are in the process of Indigenising teaching and learning practices as they pave a pathway towards reconciliation. The decolonisation of social work pedagogy, according to Sinclair (2019/2004), is a cultural imperative enacted through the contextualisation of colonisation and incorporation of theoretical and methodological knowledge based on Indigenous epistemol- ogy, including traditional wellness and healing practices. At the intersection of anti-oppressive practice and cultural compe- tence lie the practice values of empowerment, partnerships and minimal intervention, which students can draw upon in their role as constructive marginal through the process of cultural dialogue (Parrott, 2009). Culturally attuned care, through this lens, is consistent with a human rights approach and the social work profession’s ethical principles of re- spect for the inherent dignity and worth of all persons and pursuit of so- cial justice (CASW, 2005). Instructors set the tone by genuinely and deliberately embodying the values and ethics which they teach. Promoting inclusive class-rooms and teachable moments Schools of social work are a microcosm of broader society, where rac- ism, sexism, heterosexism, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, ableism, 472 Corry AzzopardiDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 classism and other forms of oppression remain a grim reality. Attention to culture and diversity in the class-room can, therefore, evoke strong emotional reactions amongst some students and educators, whether based on personal opinion and disposition, lived experience with privi- lege and subjugation, moral and ethical stance or socio-political agenda. Unsettling but important conversations that challenge taken-for-granted assumptions and deep-seated biases may give rise to feelings of distress, anxiety, anger, shame and defensiveness. As white women, in particular, begin to confront their own social positioning and complicity in racism and patriarchy, their reconciliation or resistance can show up as visceral emotionality steeped in sorrow, fear, guilt, denial or deflection. As asserted by Jeyapal and Grigg (in press), white women’s tearful reac- tions to anti-racism education may be understood as politically- motivated expressions of white privilege and appropriated victimisation, reflective of the ‘crying white woman’ archetype. Student engagement and opposition are further influenced by instructors’ academic status, perceived alliances and social locations across power hierarchies. For ex- ample, as a white woman teaching in a feminised context wherein white- ness is pervasive and firmly embedded, I may encounter more intense hostility and backlash from some students than a white male instructor whose superiority and competence are presumed, yet far less than a racialised female instructor whose inferiority and incompetence are pre- sumed (Gutie´ rrez y Muhs et al., 2012). Anti-oppressive social work education demands awareness of the poli- tics of power that play out in the class-room community. Power imbalan- ces can manifest as overt conflict, micro-aggressions or self-censorship for reasons of political correctness (Hyde and Ruth, 2002; Sue et al., 2007; Otuyelu et al., 2016), all of which can impede learning if not iden- tified and negotiated effectively. As social work educators, we lack the ability and authority to make academia safe for all. We can, however, take purposeful steps in our attempt to create safer spaces for ourselves and our students, recognising that safety is neither a neutral nor uniform goal. Accordingly, critical incidents have the potential to be transformed into valuable teachable moments through constructive and reflective cul- tural dialogue leading to new insights and connections. This dialogue should begin early in the academic term to set in motion an atmosphere of inclusion, affirmation and respect, where risk-taking, agency and ac- countability are encouraged. In anticipation of the tension that will inev- itably surface, mutual negotiation of group norms, ground rules or guidelines for class-room conduct, power dynamics, emotive expression, language and values can help to nurture a learning and teaching envi- ronment in which students and instructors can critically engage with issues of culture and diversity (Ellsworth, 1989; Razack, 1999). Revisited throughout the term, these shared goals and expectations of the mate- rial, emotional and interpersonal conditions for optimal learning can Cross-Cultural Social Work Education 473Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 build trust, minimise resistance and enable proactive alleviation of prob- lems. Ellsworth (1989) cautions, however, that democratic dialogue can never be fully achieved since, even in the most progressive class-rooms, no person or group is free of oppressive social formations. Though a subject of debate, written or verbal trigger/content warnings can be another useful pedagogical tool to promote a culture of informed and empathic adult learning (Godderis and Root, 2016). While arguably providing only an illusion of security and reinforcing the aforementioned crying white woman narrative, the careful, conscientious and compas- sionate use of warnings preceding sensitive and traumatic content has the potential to advance student empowerment, consent and autonomy in deciding how to more safely participate in their own learning. Efforts to cultivate safer spaces for teaching and learning about culture should not, however, stifle difficult but necessary discussions simply to avoid impending distress or conflict. Some level of discomfort and intensity should be expected and even embraced as a marker of necessary change. A fine balance is required. Educators must be prepared to astutely iden- tify and judiciously mitigate class-room conflict and power dynamics that reproduce oppressive conditions. Drawing on Schon’s (1983) reflective practitioner paradigm, Mishna and Bogo (2007) propose a framework for responding to conflict in social work class-rooms based on the prac- tice principle of reflection, enhanced by mindfulness to attain and main- tain a heightened level of awareness. This in-the-moment approach enables thoughtful attention to process and content during inevitable disjunctions in diversity teachings that obstruct competing voices from being heard. Consciousness of who holds space in the class-room can be furthered by contemplating three crucial questions posed by bell Hooks (1994): ‘Who speaks? Who listens? And why?’ (p. 40). Fostering critical thinking, self-reflection and cultural humility Critical thinking is the cornerstone of good social work practice and a central social work educational goal for working with difference, as well as an essential skill and required action for each of the dimensions of cross-cultural social work discussed above. Teaching students to think critically involves carefully questioning, evaluating, and challenging dom- inant discourses, ideologies, and arguments regarding their assumptions, values, evidence, and relevance (Samson, 2016). Cultural competence necessitates a capacity to think critically about hierarchical relationships of power, privileged and marginalised social categories, normative and critical constructions of culture, Eurocentric and ‘other’ sources of knowledge, amplified and suppressed voices, and mainstream and alter- native approaches to helping. This higher order thinking can stimulate critical self-reflection. 474 Corry AzzopardiDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 Critical consciousness of self has become the mantra of multicultural education and practice (Pitner and Sakamoto, 2005). Drawing on Reynolds, (1942) classic stages of learning and teaching social work, Hendricks (2003) discusses stage-specific developmental steps towards success or relative mastery of cultural competence, beginning with cul- tural self-awareness. Integrative self-awareness, as both a pre-requisite for, and product of, cultural competency (Feize and Gonzalez, 2018), is gained through the deliberate and continuous process of self-reflection. Exploration of one’s own cultural background and social identities in re- lationship to others, and the meanings we attach to culture and diversity, is a necessary starting point for students, as well as instructors for whom teaching and learning occur simultaneously. Expanding on this pedagogi- cal strategy introduced earlier, critical self-reflection entails critical anal- yses of our multiple social locations as sources of privilege and oppression; how these dual relations of power manifest in our lives per- sonally, interpersonally and structurally; where we may be complicit in privileging and oppressing others, whether consciously and uncon- sciously; and how our social positioning, worldviews and power pene- trate practice. Cultural understanding is deeply engrained and self-reflection is deeply personal. Open and honest critique of self can be a powerful pro- cess; it can also be a threatening one. Individual readiness to confront cross-cultural power asymmetries varies based on unique life stories, and situating oneself on the privilege–oppression spectrum will be met with resistance by some. Our standpoints and perspectives will always be con- strained by the social positions we occupy. Through meaningful intro- spection and interrogation, we may begin to identify, negotiate and disrupt prevailing cultural discourses, preconceived ideas, essentialist attributions and biased ways of thinking and doing. Use of self or per- sonal self-disclosure in the class-room, when exercised with purpose and caution, can be a compelling mechanism through which instructors dem- onstrate awareness of their subjugated and privileged selves and illus- trate the lived effects of power disparities. Critical self-awareness and self-reflection are potent channels to cul- tural humility. Building on the work of Tervalon and Murray-Garcı´a (1998) and Ortega and Faller (2011), Fisher-Borne et al. (2015) propose a conceptual model for cultural humility, wherein its three intercon- nected elements are institutional and individual accountability, life-long learning and critical self-reflection, and mitigating individual and struc- tural power imbalances. Its positive effects have been demonstrated em- pirically (Hook et al., 2013). Cultural humility should be modelled by instructors as a useful paradigm for students as they tackle the simulta- neous processes of unlearning and learning; that is, unlearning dominant cultural narratives and presuppositions, while learning to approach Cross-Cultural Social Work Education 475Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 helping from a place of humbleness, authenticity, openness and commit- ment to justice. Evaluating cross-cultural awareness and responsiveness The language of cultural competence inherently implies tangible out- comes. Identifying and evaluating competencies, however, is challenging, ideologically and methodologically, for a number of reasons: positivist definitions of evidence of competence contradict postmodern thinking; conceptualisations of competence lack clearly operationalised criteria and a coherent theoretical base; little consensus exists on what consti- tutes discrete components of competence; learning to work competently across differences is a cumulative process, thus level of competence at any given time is partial and incomplete; some procedural and meta- competencies do not lend themselves well to measurement; there are few sufficiently valid measures suitable for social work; and the distinc- tion between overall practice competencies and cultural competencies may be artificial (Boyle and Springer, 2001; Williams, 2006; Krentzman and Townsend, 2008; Jani et al., 2011; Jani et al., 2016). Notwithstanding the many challenges, evidence of entry-level competence for social work practice is necessary and therefore requires some reconciliation of these contradictions. This is vital as students have reported feeling ill- equipped to respond empathically and effectively across differences in objective structured clinical practice examinations (Logie et al., 2015) and have voiced a strong desire for more opportunities to learn and practice cross-culturally (Small et al., 2017). There has been a movement in social work education towards competency-based curriculum design and performance evaluation (Bogo, 2010), though benchmarks are difficult to discern. According to Jani et al. (2016), knowledge and attitudes for cultural competence are best evaluated with quantitative methods, while practice skills and behaviours require a blend of quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods. Discrepant in their reliability, validity and applicability to social work, a number of scales have been developed to assess various items of cultural competence, including self-awareness of biases, capacity to identify op- pression and levels of cultural responsiveness (Boyle and Springer, 2001; Krentzman and Townsend, 2008; Pitner et al., 2018). Self-report instru- ments can be a useful tool for students to track self-efficacy and progress over time; however, their narrow scope may be insufficient on their own. Alternative methods of evaluation that tap into the more nuanced and experiential markers of cross-cultural sensitivity and responsivity in- clude reflective journaling, process recordings and direct observation of practice in role plays, simulated labs or diverse field settings (Cramer et al., 2012; Teasley et al., 2014; Jani et al., 2016). Holistic, immersive 476 Corry AzzopardiDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/50/2/464/5716399 by 81695661, OUP on 10 April 2020 and creative approaches such as these can offer a window into personal transformations in cultural understanding, critical thinking skills, depth of self-reflection and application of anti-oppressive principles. Conclusion Dominant discourse on culture and cultural competence has begun to shift in social work pedagogy as we closely examine and challenge the hegemonic knowledge and value base upon which our profession was constructed. This article presented a critical framework for teaching and learning cross-cultural social work grounded in our collective pursuit of social justice. All instructor–student and clinician–client dyads are sites of cross-cultural encounters. We are therefore always teaching and prac- ticing across different intersectional identities and will always require a culturally conscious and responsive lens. The life-long learning journey towards cultural competence is non-linear but, ideally, intentionally and steadily progressive. Critical engagement with the anti-oppressive princi- ples of diversity, equity and inclusion is inseparable from our profes- sion’s social justice mission, and fundamental to an academic ethos that inspires and enables cultural dialogue to be taken up in the social work class-room. Cultivating an enriching teaching and learning environment that fosters critical thinking about cross-cultural relations of power will best prepare students to practice effectively, ethically and justly in a con- tinuously evolving global context.
