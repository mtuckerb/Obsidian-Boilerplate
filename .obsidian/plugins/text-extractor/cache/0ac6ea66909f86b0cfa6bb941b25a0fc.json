Davis b aDepartment of Sociology, Indiana University-Bloomington, Bloomington, USA; bSchool of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University, Bloomington, USA ABSTRACT This paper focuses on the social media presence of Black Lives Matter (BLM). Specifically, we examine how social media users interact with BLM by using hashtags and thus modify the framing of the movement. We call this decentralized interaction with the movement “distributed framing”. Empirically, we illustrate this idea with an analysis of 66,159 tweets that mention #BlackLivesMatter in 2014, when #BlackLivesMatter becomes prominent on social media. We also tally the other hashtags that appear with #BlackLivesMatter in order to measure how online communities influence the framing of the movement. We find that #BlackLivesMatter is associated with five types of hashtags. These hashtags mention solidarity or approval of the movement, refer to police violence, mention movement tactics, mention Ferguson, or express counter-movement sentiments. The paper concludes with hypotheses about the development of movement framings that can be addressed in future research. ARTICLE HISTORY Received 7 December 2016; Accepted 20 April 2017 KEYWORDS Framing; social movements; social media; Black Lives Matter; online activism; policing Introduction On 13 July 2013, George Zimmerman was acquitted of the murder of Sanford, Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. This acquittal was a defining moment for U.S. race relations, particularly considering the months of protests and demon- strations in response to Martin’s murder in the winter of 2012, the subsequent lag in police officers’ decision to arrest Zimmerman, and Martin’s criminaliza- tion within the media. After the verdict was released, the words “Black Lives Matter (BLM)” first appeared on Facebook, one of the world’s largest online social networks. Since then, BLM has become an ubiquitous presence in American culture. Not surprisingly, the precise message that the movement communicates to the public is complex. As a decentralized movement, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group CONTACT Jelani Ince jince@indiana.edu ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES, 2017 VOL. 40, NO. 11, 1814–1830 https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2017.1334931 many actors can appropriate the movement’s phraseology and deploy it for their own goals. The basic framing of the movement, Black lives matter, invites the audience to further consider a number of issues that affect Black Americans ranging from racial inequality to police violence to healthcare. Thus, the appearance of BLM raises an important question for the sociological study of ethnic and racial social movements. How does a movement like BLM shape its identity in the age of social media? How do people attach meaning to the frames offered by a movement? These questions speak to longstanding debates within sociology about how social movements articulate grievances and encourage people to accept their arguments. The starting point of these debates is the “movement frame”, which denotes the way that activists define problems to encourage movement participation. The literature on movement frames, briefly reviewed in the next section, focuses on the components of frames and how they can be used to promote coordination and cooperation in the movement. Thus, the discussion of movement frames typically focuses on the activists who tend to be at the centre of a movement. What is not discussed as much is how the wider public interacts with the frames offered by the movement. This is especially important for contemporary movements who choose to promul- gate their arguments through social media, which, by its very nature, allows a wide population to shape and alter the movement’s message. The public’s interaction with a movement via social media is of wider importance because it is one process, among many, that shapes a movement’s develop- ment and final outcomes. This paper explores the public’s interaction with an emergent social move- ment through a study of how people use phrases associated with BLM on Twitter. Specifically, we study hashtag co-occurrence – the hashtags that also appear in messages when the user refers to BLM – to understand how people associated the words that describe this social movement with other words, and thus add and extend to the movement’s original meaning. Empiri- cally, we will use a random sample of 66,159 Tweets taken from an archive of the Twitter stream housed at Indiana University to describe the range of ideas that occurred as BLM emerged as a national movement. The public interacts with a movement: amending and extending framing research A fundamental observation about social movements is that they frame social issues (McAdam 1996; Miller 2000; Sewell 2001; Ferree et al. 2002). That is, they engage in a process of meaning construction that allows audiences within the movement to understand a social situation in a specific way. The term “move- ment frame” was introduced into the literature on social movements by Snow et al. (1986) who wished to provide a language to discuss how activists ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES 1815 interpret problems and are motivated to act. Framing allows activists to depict some policy, or state of affairs, as morally suspect or illegitimate, which scho- lars call the “diagnostic” aspect of framing (Snow and Benford 1988; Gerhards and Rucht 1992; Benford 1993; Johnson 1997). Furthermore, framing usually entails a proscription – a solution that movement activists think will address the situation – and a call to action. Here, we draw attention to the following issues in the literature and offer a theory of how the public interacts with frames. First, there is relatively little analysis of how the wider public interacts with and modifies movement frames. That is, most of the analysis of movement frames tends to be “move- ment-centric” in that it asks what framing does for a movement or how move- ment actors create frames. Numerous studies investigate how a movement frame facilitates collective action and how leaders, as well as rank and file acti- vists, shape the frame (Benford and Snow 2000; Snow et al. 1986). There are also numerous studies addressing how rival groups within a social movement contest a frame and use their social and political resources to establish a pre- ferred frame (Tversky and Kahneman 1981; Mansbridge 1986; Riker 1986). However, there is relatively little research that examines how the vast audi- ences beyond the movement accept and utilize the words and ideas that con- stitute a movement frame. In other words, it is relatively rare for scholarship to explore how the millions of people who observe a movement accept, reject, or otherwise interact with the rhetorical and discursive actions of a move- ment. The interaction of the wider public and the movement via its frame is crucial for studies of social change since the success of movements often hinges on how the wider public perceives the movement, its demands, and its proposed policy solutions. Second, much of the literature on framing processes within movements uses data gathered from political organizations, news sources, activist inter- views, and ethnographic fieldwork (Tufekci and Wilson 2012; Halvorsen 2014). This type of data is extremely valuable in that it provides dynamic, and historically rooted, thick descriptions of movements and their attempts to instigate social change. However, the emergence of social media in the early twenty-first century has created a new source of data that can be used to further explore the discursive processes associated with movements. Already, a number of scholars have used social media data and online data to explore how populations of movement organizations describe themselves (Harlow 2009; Gerbaudo 2012; Youmans and York 2012). Third, there is limited discussion among movement researchers about the framing of black social movements in the post-Civil Rights era. The main con- clusion of historical and social scientific research on mid-twentieth century African-American movements is that they were framed in terms of desegrega- tion and political equality while nationalist African-American movements often presented themselves as proponents of autonomy and, in some 1816 J. INCE ET AL. cases, anti-capitalism (e.g. Rojas 2007). We contribute to this literature by showing how contemporary movements, like BLM, build upon and extend the framings developed by earlier movements. We show how the framing of BLM emerges from the juxtaposition of individuals who were harmed by police violence and a call to non-violent action, much in the same way the Civil Rights activists were responding to the murder of individuals like Emmett Till and thus promoted non-violence. We argue that social media data can allow scholars to illuminate how the broader public interacts with movement frames. Social media is now an arena where social movements promote their message, articulate their core beliefs, and offer a frame to the public. Social media is also a forum where “the average citizen” can directly interact with a movement. In some cases, the interaction can be simple. A Twitter or Facebook user can share content gen- erated by a social movement. Social media also permits individuals to have more complex interactions with a movement. They may talk with each other about a movement, contact movement leaders who have a social media presence, debate the movement’s legitimacy, and otherwise contribute to the overall discourse around a movement. All of these activities affect how a frame emerges and shapes the growth of a movement. Distributed framing theory and social media The principal feature of social media is that users generate content. Unlike print or broadcast media, platforms such as Twitter encourage individuals to generate their own “content”, which other users can discuss or link to. Thus, social media, by its very nature, is a decentralized method for creating and disseminating ideas. These properties – user driven content and decen- tralization – make social media appealing to movements. Not surprisingly, many movements, and other political organizations, maintain presences on various social media platforms. Overall, there are many ways for the public to interact with a movement frame within social media. McCaughey and Ayers (2003) offer a review of the growing literature addressing online activism and social media. In this article, we focus on one way that the public interacts with the frame that a movement offers – the use of indexing or labelling functions. That is, many social media platforms allow users to use a special symbol, usually a hash (#), to index, label or flag content so that other users may find it (e.g. “Vote for #Obama”). The use of hashtags is ubiquitous in online politics. Some users employ hashtags to create an easily searchable stream of posts about a specific topic, such as #election2016. Others may use the hashtag to associ- ate one political idea with another. For example, one can imagine a supporter of Donald Trump trying to link that candidate with a generally positive message (e.g. “Vote for #TheDonald he’ll #makeamericagreat”). Thus, indexing ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES 1817 is the way that “the crowd” on social media sorts through content and labels it in an attempt to create a semantic network. Much as a book’s index clusters ideas with tags, social media hashtags group messages and ideas together. Sociologically, indexing is important because it represents a collective attempt to create categories in an otherwise unruly collection of texts. If a user introduces a tag that others find helpful, then that tag can connect content, structure conversation, and introduce meaning to a discursive field. When hashtags are extremely successful, such as #BlackLivesMatter, they can create a community of like-minded people who can sustain a conversa- tion and even mobilize offline. We argue that the use of hashtags, and other indexing behaviours, are a form of distributed framing. That is, framing via hashtags is one way that movements develop an understanding of problems and solutions that does not exclusively rely on leaders within the movement or other highly visible individuals. Instead, a larger audience can append their own meanings to the messages emanating from a movement and create communities focused around more specific issues. However, the open nature of social media also allows counter-movement actors to intervene in a movements dis- course. Critics and detractors may use hashtags to argue or dispute the rheto- ric offered by a movement. In the remainder of this paper, we illustrate how distributed framing works with data from the BLM movement, which appeared in 2014. The next section presents a history of BLM that will guide the empirical analysis. We then use a large sample of tweets from 2014 to map out the rise of BLM within Twitter. By tracking the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, we can identify the precise moments the movement achieved more visibility. We also examine the other hashtags that co-occur with #BlackLivesMatter and examine the different meanings that Twitter users attached to the movement, including counter-movement actors. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this type of analysis might be extended and the limitations of the research design. A brief review of BLM On the evening of George Zimmerman’s acquittal from the killing of seven- teen year old Sanford, FL teenager Trayvon Martin, Alicia Garza, in an attempt to articulate her pain and frustration with the verdict posted what she described as a “love letter to Black folks on Facebook”. She ended the post writing, “Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter. Black lives matter” (California Sunday, March 3, 2015). Garza’s friend, activist and prison abolitionist Patrisse Cullors, moved by her words, replied on the post, “#Black- LivesMatter” (The Washington Post, August 19, 2015). Soon, Cullors and Garza began brainstorming about how to make the hashtag a campaign for mobil- ization. While strategizing, Opal Tometi, an immigrant rights group activist in 1818 J. INCE ET AL. New York, immediately added her support to the movement in response to Cullors’ comment (Garza 2017). Garza, Coullors, and Tometi began creating tumblr pages, influencing other social media outlets and placing posters in local California businesses in order to spread news about the “#BlackLivesMat- ter” moniker. “BLM” trickled into national discourse after several police killings of unarmed African-Americans, including the killing of Michael Brown: Staten Island resident Eric Garner on 17 July 2014, Dayton, Ohio resident John Craw- ford on 5 August 2014, and Los Angeles resident Ezell Ford on 11 August 2014. However, the event that propelled it into mainstream popularity was the 9 August 2014 killing of Brown in Ferguson, MO, a suburb of St. Louis. After Brown was killed, many Americans on social media outlets began using the hashtag as a cry for racial justice. Social unrest and protests appeared on the streets of Ferguson, and other cities around the country. In response to these events, news outlets portrayed many activists shouting this phrase and carrying signs with the phrase painted on them. The media began framing these demonstrations in response to Brown’s killing as literal manifes- tations of the phrase. However, organized demonstrations against the killings of black civilians and the formation of activist organizations (such as the Black Youth Project 100) were established prior to Brown’s killing (Taylor 2016). Fur- thermore, the BLM project had already established a cohesive base prior to the events in Ferguson, indicating that the movement was underway before- hand (Black Voice News, January 13, 2015). Prior demonstrations, in conjunction with protests in Ferguson and other Ferguson-related events such as the BLM Freedom Ride, represented a well-organized activist group. This enabled the BLM phrase and the activists’ demands to be taken seriously within public dis- course. Since Brown’s death, and the subsequent non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson, other Black Americans—such as Tamir Rice in November 2014, Freddie Gray in April 2015, and Korryn Gaines in August 2016—have died at the hands of police and inspired further protest activity. Data To study the process of distributed framing on social media, we obtained a large sample of tweets containing hashtags matching #BlackLivesMatter*, capitalized in any way. The trailing asterisk indicates a wildcard search, used in order to match hashtags such as #BlackLivesMatterSTL or #BlackLivesMat- terFerguson. The sample period starts at the beginning of 2014 to capture the genesis of the #BLM meme, and ends after November 2014 in order to capture reaction from the non-indictment of Darren Wilson in the killing of Michael Brown. This sample was obtained from the database behind the Observatory on Social Media (OSoMe) (Davis et al. 2016). OSoMe’s database contains a random sample of approximately 10 per cent of all public Twitter messages ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES 1819 from January 2011 to the present. Interactive tools and an Application Programming Interface (API) for OSoMe are available to the public at osome.iu.edu (Table 1). Our search yielded 66,159 messages. This suggests, overall, that BLM was mentioned over 660,000 times during our eleven-month search period. This sample of tweets was then examined further in two ways. First, we created a table of hashtags that co-occur in the same tweet with #BlackLivesMatter*. This tabulation is not case sensitive. For instance, terms like #ferguson and #Ferguson are counted as the same token. We discovered 632 hashtags that co-occurred with #BlackLivesMatter* in at least ten tweets from our sample. Then, as explained below, these terms were hand coded into a small number of categories. Second, we created an adjacency graph of which terms appeared in the same Twitter messages to help us visualize the semantic network of #BlackLivesMatter on Twitter. Hashtag coding Using our database of tweets, we gathered hashtags that co-occurred with “#BlackLivesMatter” during three phases. First, we examined hashtags during the entirety of 2014. In the first phase, we looked at hashtags that appeared from the beginning of 2014 through 9 August 2014, which is the time period before, and until the date that, Michael Brown was shot. In the second phase, we examined the hashtags that appeared from 10 August 2014 to 24 November 2014 at 9:25 pm EST, which is the period after Michael Brown’sshootingand until the grand jury’s decision to not indict Darren Wilson. In the third phase, we assessed the hashtags that appeared from 24 November 2014 at 9:25 pm EST through 30 November 2014, which is after the release of the grand jury’s decision. This periodization enables us to capture when the BLM hashtag gained traction online, when movement activity began, and which topics of dis- cussion were most salient during this time period. Once the tweets were acquired, we focused on the top hundred hashtags from the dataset. In order to analyse the hashtags, we focused on five elements of the BLM framing: Ferguson, movement tactics, police violence, movement solidarity, and counter protests. If a hashtag fit into any of the categories, it was coded Table 1. Tweet data collection.

Some of the hashtags were coded into more than one category (Table 2). A hashtag was coded into the Ferguson category if it clearly referred to events stemming from the shooting of Michael Brown, the non-indictment of Darren Wilson, and the consequent protest and unrest. A hashtag fit the police violence category if it used words related to police shootings of specific individuals and statements made by victims of police violence (e.g. “#ICantBreathe”). A hashtag fit the tactics category if it referred to protest tactics and actions related to the BLM movement. A tweet fit the solidarity and expressiveness category if it had text that repeated or affirmed the core messages of the BLM movement or showed solidarity with the movement. The counter protest category was used if there was text relating to blocking the goals, tactics and ideology of the BLM movement or that presented an alternative movement (e.g. #BlueLivesMat- ter). We recognize that these categories do not capture the complete range of sentiments associated with BLM. For example, we found that Twitter users often mentioned specific cities, such as New York or Los Angeles, very broad political sentiments that were not necessarily focused on police violence issues (e.g. #usa), or current events not directly related to BLM, such as the militant Islamic group ISIS. Results Figure 1 shows the daily counts of the BLM hashtag. To provide a baseline for comparison, we also included hashtag mentions of the Trayvon Martin killing, which was viewed as an example of the unjust treatment of young black men. Table 2. Examples of hashtags by category.

For example, #nojusticeformikebrown was coded as both solidarity/expressive and Ferguson related. ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES 1821 Figure 1 shows that while the killing of Trayvon Martin and the early days of BLM coincide, BLM did not show appreciable growth on social media during this period. Instead, BLM largely grows during the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting. Table 3 shows the hashtags most likely to occur with #BlackLivesMatter. Overall, the most common hashtags that appear are those dealing with the unrest surrounding Michael Brown’s shooting. The most common co-occur- ring hashtag is #Ferguson, which appears 29 per cent of the time. Among the top five co-occurring hashtags, four are Ferguson related. The exception is #alllivesmatter, which appears 1.3 per cent of the time. Among the top ten hashtags that occur with #BlackLivesMatter, six are Ferguson related. Two refer to protest tactics (#shutitdown and #blackoutfriday) and one refers to a counter protest (#alllivesmatter). This suggests that the framing for BLM, for the public at least, shifted dramatically from focusing on Trayvon Martin’s shooting in Florida to the issues raised by the Ferguson pro- tests (Table 3). Next, we examined the relative frequency of different types of hashtags during the 2014 year, as well as before and after the Ferguson unrest. In 2014, 18 per cent of the hashtags in our dataset discussed Ferguson; 16 per cent discussed tactics; 23 per cent discussed police violence; 4 per cent dis- cussed a counter protest; and 25 per cent discussed solidarity. In other Figure 1. Daily mentions of #BlackLivesMatter, #TrayvonMartin, and #MichaelBrown for the 2014 calendar year.

INCE ET AL. words, a large number of hashtags highlighted some of the main tenets of the BLM movement such as anti-police violence and racial group support. The trajectory of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag is more fully understood when we examine these categories before and after the Ferguson unrest and the non-indictment of Darren Wilson. We draw attention to the raw fre- quency of #BlackLivesMatter. Before the Ferguson unrest, we observed #BlackLivesMatter mentioned in our 10 per cent sample a mere 373 times in 2014. Considering that in 2014, nearly 280 million individuals used Twitter, it is remarkable that the phrase rarely appeared. In contrast, #BlackLi- vesMatter quickly escalated in the post-Ferguson era.

Once again, this reinforces the hypothesis that the Michael Brown shooting and the subsequent protest was a strong factor that cata- pulted the movement to national consciousness (Figure 2). A closer examination of our hashtag categories reveals more important information. In the time before Michael Brown’s shooting, 13 per cent of the hashtags discussed Ferguson; 1 per cent discussed tactics; 25 per cent dis- cussed police violence; 30 per cent discussed solidarity; and 1 per cent dis- cussed a counter protest. Even before the movement escalated in the weeks after Michael Brown’s death, social media users were flooding BLM with expressions of solidarity. In other words, after the Michael Brown shoot- ing, we notice an increase of hashtags that discuss police violence and a slight decrease in hashtags that discuss Ferguson. During the time after Michael Brown’s death and before the grand jury’s decision to not indict Darren Wilson, we see an increase in hashtag use across all categories: 21 per cent of the hashtags discussed Ferguson; 14 per cent discussed tactics; 33 per cent discussed police violence; 38 per cent discussed solidarity; and 4 per cent discussed a counter protest. This may be a reflection of conversations surrounding the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin shooting, along with rising news and information surrounding Ferguson and Michael Brown. What is also significant to note is the increase of hashtags that discussed solidarity. As Ferguson became prominently featured in national discourse, it likely encouraged social media users to express their concern. We also note that this is a period where we see increased discussion of boycotts, die-ins, and other protest tactics. This is observed through hash- tags like #blackoutfriday, a callout for a boycott, and #o22, a reference to 22 October, which is the National Day Against Police Brutality. This indicates that the BLM audience is aware of events promoted by activists. Figure 2. Types of hashtags that appear with #BlackLivesMatter in 2014. 1824 J. INCE ET AL. During the period after the non-indictment of Darren Wilson, 22 per cent of the hashtags discussed Ferguson; 21 per cent discussed tactics; 21 per cent discussed police violence; 37 per cent discussed solidarity; and 4 per cent dis- cussed a counter protest. From these results, we see a large increase in hash- tags that discuss tactics. This is significant because this points to the role of social media in providing a space for users to discuss mobilization strategies. There is also a notable decline in references to police violence. This may indi- cate a shift in the emotive content of the movement. Instead of solely focusing on the police shootings, social media users are also likely to focus on the pro- scriptive statements and tactics of the movement. Overall, our analysis of hashtags that appear with BLM shows the following. First, most of what the audience adds is solidarity. Consistently, the most common framing that users add concerns approval of the movement and its goals. Interestingly, expressions of solidarity outnumber mentions of the movement’s specific grievances and police violence. This is consistent with political psychology research that focuses on how individuals tend to reason use cognitive shortcuts and reasoning heuristics (Tversky and Kahne- man 1981) and the sociological research on the importance of emotions in movement mobilization (Jasper 1998). Second, we see a straightforward tran- sition from a movement that is small and focused on a specific grievance to a mass movement that has more developed tactics. Third, we detect a small, but consistent, counter-movement presence on social media. The counter-move- ment only grows after the Ferguson events transform BLM into a more widely known movement. The hashtag network The previous sections examined the frequencies of hashtags that appear with #BlackLivesMatter. Figure 3 illustrates the hashtag co-occurrence network. In other words, we defined two hashtags as connected if they appear within the same Twitter post as #BlackLivesMatter. Since all such hashtags would be con- nected to #BlackLivesMatter, we do not include that term in the graph. The network visualization is enhanced in the following ways. First, more common hashtags are depicted with larger circles and labels. Second, the thickness of the line connecting two hashtags reflects the frequency these hashtags are used together. Third, we employ network theoretic algorithms to emphasize the clustering of terms. Finally, we colourize the circles in the graph by their topical category. Hashtags belonging to more than one cat- egory are coloured with a blend of the respective category colours; miscella- neous hashtags not belonging to any of the categories are coloured dark gray. The diagram has a number of important features. First, it emphasizes the basic points raised by the previous section. Much of the framing on Twitter has to do with Ferguson-related issues. This is consistent with our reading ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES 1825 of the hashtags. The way that the hashtag network is connected is important because place plays a significant role in determining a group’s collective memory within a social movement (Armstrong and Crage 2006; Heaney and Rojas 2006). Thus, Ferguson is not only important because it is a site of racial and state tensions, but its meaning carries significance within the collec- tive memory of BLM as it marks a site of memorial and remembrance. Second, the co-occurrence diagram exhibits varying degrees of clustering among the hashtag categories. Three main clusters can be seen: Ferguson, tactics, and police violence. This visual effect indicates homophily: hashtags from these categories are comparatively more likely to be used with other hashtags from the same category. Finally, the network visualization also shows the relative position of counter-protesters. In the online discourse about BLM, #alllivesmatter is strongly associated with hashtags referring to Michael Brown and BLM protest tactics. However, the hashtag is not solely concerned with expressions of dissent or approval of the non-indictment of Darren Wilson because it does appear with the mentioning of other victims of police violence, albeit at a smaller rate. Rather, we find that this counter protest is specifically aimed at subverting the collective response to Ferguson and attempts to act in response to grievances brought about by the state. Furthermore, because Figure 3. Co-occurrence network for hashtags appearing with #BlackLivesMatter. 1826 J. INCE ET AL. police officers are not a place and sentiments about them are polarizing, the network may not be as coherent. Discussion and conclusion The purpose of this paper is to explore the dynamics of the BLM movement by measuring how social media users interact with the group’s message. Theor- etically, we argue that social media allows a broad audience to alter and manipulate the movement’s construction of meaning, a process that we call distributed framing. We found that Twitter users were most likely to express approval of the movement and assert their solidarity. As #BlackLivesMatter developed in 2014, there were more mentions of specific tactics and a corre- sponding decrease in the discussion of events like Ferguson or police shoot- ings. Additionally, as #BlackLivesMatter increased its volume on social media, counter-movement hashtags appeared. This suggests a broader hypothesis that can be tested by future researchers. Framings might have a natural pattern of growth from specific grievances that attract the attention of acti- vists to a more mature phase where grievances recede in importance to tactics and policy change. We also offer a conjecture about why BLM grew during the Ferguson unrest but not during the period of time when the Trayvon Martin killing was prominent. It bears noting that, unlike Wilson, Zimmerman is a “quasi- police” member due to his self-appointment as neighbourhood watchperson, rather than an official state actor (Cherney and Chui 2010, 2011). Thus, although both Brown and Martin were criminalized in the media, it could be asserted that this difference in status informed the framing of Martin’s killing. Much of the discussion of the Trayvon Martin death focused on the actions of two specific people – Trayvon Martin and his assailant George Zimmerman. Even though Zimmerman’s trial and the media coverage were highly racia- lized, much of the popular debate was over how much evidence there was to support Zimmerman’s contention that Martin had indeed threatened him. While similar arguments were proposed in conversations about Brown, there was a key difference in how the media discussed the killings of Martin and Brown. The media did not discuss police behaviour towards African-Americans in Sanford, Florida, while the behaviour of police in Fergu- son, Missouri quickly became an issue. Furthermore, as Ferguson became popularized in the media, it became a site of activism and represented the larger issue of state violence against the African-American community. It might be argued that the media presented the Martin killing as a failure of individuals, while Brown’s killing represented a failure of the state. This is further demonstrated in the Department of Justice’s report on the Ferguson Police Department, which clearly outlined the consistency of racial bias ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES 1827 against African-Americans, affecting “nearly every aspect of Ferguson police and court operations” (The New York Times, March 4, 2015). The report argued that African-Americans living in Ferguson were right to question the practices of the Ferguson police department. Furthermore, continual abuse strained police and community relations and increased tension. The sub- sequent response that took place after Michael Brown’s shooting and the non-indictment of Darren Wilson points to the accumulative effect of this mis- treatment from the state. Finally, we discuss the limitations of using social media to study movement framings. One limitation is that we have very little data on geography. Since less than 1 per cent of users activate the geolocation function of Twitter, we are rarely able to observe where social media users are located to see if they are responding to local conditions. Second, it is very difficult to systematically study the discussions associated with a specific hashtag. Even though it is easy to identify #BlackLivesMatter in a tweet, it is hard to algorithmically assess the message’s context (i.e. whether it is a positive or negative mention or to other- wise discern the intention of the message). Sentiment analysis can be mis- leading here as, for example, a user may be showing “positive” solidarity with BLM while expressing “negative” messages of grief. These limitations can be addressed in future research. Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors. References Apuzzo, M., and J.
