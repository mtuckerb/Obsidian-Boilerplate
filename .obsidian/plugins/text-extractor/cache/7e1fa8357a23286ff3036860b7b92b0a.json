One line of justification comes from the economics of the family and is based on efficiency and the resulting specialization of women in domes- tic activities. Another emerges from the economics of contracts and the partnership between the two spouses. These two approaches give rise to a theoretical debate be- tween legal scholars. We show that this debate is more between two conceptions of alimony, efficiency or contract, than between law and economics scholars.

More specifically, this divorce law reform has introduced no-fault principles in the grounds for divorce, property distribution and alimony. One of the most important changes created by this reform is that it legalized unilateral divorces. This 'no-fault divorce revolution' has given rise to numerous law-and-economics studies, both from economists and legal scholars. The economists have studied, in particular, whether the introduction of unilateral divorce has an impact on divorce rates, given that, over the same time period, all the Western countries have witnessed an increase in their divorce rates. A vast literature has result- ed, both theoretical (Peters 1986; Allen 1992; Zelder 1993a, 1993b; Brinig and Buckley 1998; Fella et al. 2004; Méchoulan 2006), and empirical (Friedberg 1998; Binner and Dnes 2001; Wolfers 2006; Coelho & Garoupa 2006; Gonzalez & Viitanen 2009).

How- ever, most of the empirical studies on this issue conclude that there is an absence of neutrality since no-fault divorce did increase the divorce rate, although this effect appears to have diminished over time. In parallel, this 'no-fault divorce revolution' has given rise to a more specific debate amongst some American legal scholars with respect to the legal grounds for alimony. Alimony or spousal support consists of one spouse (usually the husband) paying a sum of money (lump sum or rent) or giving some of his/her assets to the other spouse (usually the wife) after divorce. For a long time, one the principal justification of this legal obligation was the fault of the debtor. However, with a divorce law leaving room for no-fault separations, this traditional justification has lost its relevance. These changes have led some American legal scholars (Cohen 1987; Ellman 1989; Carbone and Brinig 1988, 1991; Singer 1994) to question the legal grounds for awarding alimony in contemporary societies.1 As in other areas of law, these legal scholars have turned to economic analyses in their search for answers, some using the econom- ics of the family and others the economics of contracts. Ellman (1989) justifies alimony on the grounds of economically efficient choices by the spouses during the marriage. The consequences of these choices be- tween domestic activities and labor market activities appear in the case of divorce because specialization by one of the spouses can place him or her in a poor financial position. The purpose of the alimony is there- fore to incite him or her to adopt an efficient level of specialization in domestic activities by giving him or her a guarantee of being compen- sated in the event of divorce. Other scholars (Cohen 1987; Carbone and Brinig 1988, 1991) use alternative economic tools, developed in the do- main of the economics of contracts, to justify alimony. The reasoning is that if marriage is considered as a contract, its dissolution may be con- sidered, in some cases, as a breach of the agreement by one of the spouses. In that case, alimony is a form of damage remedy available to the non-breaching party. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the history of law and eco- nomics of divorce by reporting how, over the 1990s, some American le- gal scholars have mobilized reasoning and concepts from economic analyses to provide a legal basis for alimony. This dialogue between law and economics is interesting from a European perspective because the studies in this field are still very scarce in Europe (Tsaoussis 2004; Bour- reau-Dubois and Doriat-Duban 2010). While some economists and legal scholars have studied the impact of the no-fault reform on divorce rates 1 There is no evidence of such questioning in the community of European legal scholars.

Nonetheless, the framework built by both American econo- mists and legal scholars might be very useful from a European law and economics perspective, as the context of alimony has also changed no- tably in Europe with the introduction of no-fault based divorce. More precisely, this law and economics literature can be used to develop a framework where several approaches can be explored (efficiency, con- tracts) to study alimony in European countries. Consequently, this pa- per contributes to open new avenues for a European research agenda on the law and economics of divorce. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present the two main approaches of alimony that have captured legal scholars' at- tention, that of economic efficiency and a contractual relationship be- tween spouses. In Section 3, we present the debate between the legal scholars who support the efficiency approach and the proponents of a contractual approach. Finally, in Section 4, we show that, from an eco- nomic point of view, the two approaches advocated by the legal schol- ars are not fundamentally incompatible. 2. legal Analysis Renewed in a No-Fault Divorce Context With the adoption of no-fault divorce in all Western countries, judges lost one of the main justifications for awarding alimony, that of blame for the failure of the marriage. Nevertheless, they have continued to award spousal support, mainly to ex-wives, who, in general, are more likely than ex-husbands to experience a dramatic drop in their living standard post-marriage. However, there isno theory to justify why either spouse should have a financial obligation to the other that persists even after their marriage ends (2. 1). Some legal scholars have thus sug- gested new justifications based on economic approaches, first an efficien- cy-based approach (2.2), and second a contract-based approach (2.3). 2. 1. No-Fault Divorce and the Theoretical Vacuum with Respect to Alimony In most Western countries, an 'olď conception of marriage prevailed until the end of the 1960s. The role of each spouse was clearly defined and corresponded to the standards of society: the husband invested mostly in his professional career, while his wife devoted herself to the household and childcare. The consequences for breaching those stan- dards were very clear: the wives lost their status and support, while the husbands had to share their wealth through property division and often This content downloaded from 50.236.80.176 on Fri, 06 Jan 2023 18:39:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 150 Cécile Bourreau-Dubois and Myriam Doriat-Duban alimony (Brinig and Crafton 1994)- But above all, divorce was related to a fault by either spouse and the alimony was considered as «compen- satory damages for the 'guilty' spouse's wrongful conduct» (Singer 1994, 2424). In the 1970s, no-fault divorces became permissible in most West- ern countries and gradually replaced the fault-divorce. Alimony lost its primary legal justification, given that divorce was possible without any reference to the fault of one or the other spouse. Consequently, as Brinig and Crafton (1994) note, a damage remedy was no longer justi- fied. In other words, «divorce reform thus left alimony in somewhat of a theoretical vacuum» (Singer 1994, 2425), because explanations based on fault were no longer suited to the new conception of marriage. Some other justification had therefore to be found (Ellman 1989). In this context, judges and legal scholars have found a first alternative reason to award alimony based on maintenance motivations: covering the basic needs of the ex-spouse (usually, the ex-wife), at least for a cer- tain period of time. However, this conception of alimony as a tempo- rary financial support from one ex-spouse to the other has no real jus- tification, legal or economic. From a legal point of view, Ellman (1989, 5) explains that the financial need of one spouse at the termination of a marriage does not lead in- evitably to the conclusion that the other spouse must meet that need. A theory of al- imony must explain why spouses should be liable for each other s needs after their marriage has ended. From an economic perspective, this reason to award alimony is basically financial: its justification is not grounded on real economic analysis, that is, by mobilizing the economists' tools and concepts (optimal behavior, efficiency, incentives, etc.). Ellman (1989, 5) concludes that «the answer is that alimony's form has remained the same while its function has changed». Thus the challenge for legal scholars was to find new justifi- cations for this transfer between ex-spouses, in a society where divorce was no longer necessarily founded on fault.1 2. 2. Justification for Alimony Based on the Economics of the Family The 1970s were marked by the birth of the economics of family, thanks to the American economist Gary Becker who proposed to ex- 1 The introduction of no-fault principles in divorce law does not imply the disappearance of divorces caused by fault. The fault remains an important factor in the dissolution of mar- riage, even if the number of fault-divorces tends to decrease sharply. The fact that Western countries have often shortened the duration of mutual-consent divorce proceedings has prob- ably led to a reduction in the number of fault-based divorces, by inducing couples to choose 'no-fault divorce' because the proceeding is easier, cheaper and faster.

At the begin- ning of the 1970s, Becker published two seminal articles in the Journal of Political Economy in which he developed an economic theory of marriage based on a demand and supply model where individuals are viewed as rational optimizers who behave in marriage as they do in a firm. The analysis is founded on 'shadow' prices in terms of shares of the gains from marriage. Thus, Becker 'allowed' economics scholars to develop a specific analysis of the family, taking into account, in particular, the incentives to get married and divorced. A large theoret- ical and empirical literature has resulted on the determinants and the consequences of marriage and divorce. Although there have been relatively few studies about alimony, it must be noted that the first economics paper about alimony was written by one of Becker's co- authors, Elisabeth Landes (1978). The title of Landes's paper is unequivocal about the author's aims: to provide an economic analysis of alimony, built exclusively on economic concepts. Her theoretical model shows how economic analysis justifies alimony when considered in a normative perspective with the aim of achieving efficiency. Indeed, according to Landes (1978, 36) the role of alimony is to compensate the wife for the opportunity costs she incurs by entering and investing in the marriage. As such, the award and enforcement of al- imony payments by the courts encourage optimal resource allocation within mar- riage, increase gain from marriage, and encourage the formation, productivity, and stability of marriage. To understand this conclusion, it should be remembered that, in this type of economic analysis, the marriage is assumed to be a husband- wife partnership where the aim is to maximize the joint expected income, which includes the earnings of family and also household com- modities (goods specific to the marriage like childcare, meal prepara- tion, and all the activities which contribute to the welfare of the family). The model is built on three assumptions (Landes 1978, 40) the household production is completely marital specific and would be valueless in the event of divorce, household commodities and the wife's earnings are produced by the wife's time alone, the husband's earnings are produced by his time and the time his wife devotes to household production. Under these hypotheses and within a two-period model, the optimal degree of household specialization can be determined by maximizing the present value of total marital income, first without including the This content downloaded from 50.236.80.176 on Fri, 06 Jan 2023 18:39:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 152 Cécile Bourreau-Dubois and Myriam Doriat-Duban probability of divorce and then by taking it into account in the second period. Not surprisingly, it appears that the higher the probability of divorce, the lower the optimal degree of household specialization in both periods. Alimony is justified in this context if there are some positive transac- tion costs of negotiating and executing the necessary transfers between the two members of the couple to reach the optimal level of specializa- tion. More precisely, if the marital income is ftilly divisible, if transfers are costless, and if the expected probability of divorce is the same for the two spouses, the optimal level of specialization will be obtained in- dependently of the liability assignment, in accordance with the Coase theorem. Conversely, positive transaction costs (because of informa- tional asymmetry, public goods, etc.) may prevent achievement of the optimal level of household production. This is especially the case be- cause a wife's investment in her household may not generate immedi- ate returns and there is a risk of eventually not being compensated for her investment with the consequence that she invests less in the house- hold. It is also the case when the wife contributes to increasing her hus- band s earning capacity: she agrees to specialize in marital production if she can hope to be compensated during the period of her investment or in the future. In this context, alimony is interpreted as a contingent claim payable to the wife in the event of divorce that permits the spous- es to make the optimal choice in terms of specialization. In other words, there is an optimal amount of alimony that ensures that the wife's op- timal specialization is restored even if a risk of divorce exists and if transaction costs are non-negligible. Landes's analysis gives a first economic justification to alimony based on efficiency: the role of alimony is to induce spouses to choose optimal levels of specialization in order to maximize their joint marital income. Thus, from an economic perspective, alimony has a direct pos- itive effect because it makes the spouses adopt a maximizing behavior with respect to the joint marital income. However, alimony has a sec- ond positive effect that can be identified by referring to another analy- sis where Landes, with Becker and Michael (19 77), shows that greater specialization and specific investment in marriage reduce the probabil- ity of divorce by increasing the marital income relative to the income the spouses could otherwise receive if they were not married. Thus, al- imony has a second positive effect: «by encouraging efficient resource allocation within marriage, an efficient system of alimony promotes both the initial formation and continued stability of marriages» (Lan- des 1978, 49). This view is shared by Ellman (1989, 48) who explains that «while a wife's strategy of reducing marriage-specific investment may protect her from some financial loss if divorce occurs, it also increases This content downloaded from 50.236.80.176 on Fri, 06 Jan 2023 18:39:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Law and Economics of Alimony 153 the chance that divorce will occur and reduces the chance of marriage in the first place». Landes's conception of alimony explains specialization as resulting from the maximization of the joint marital income, through the deter- mination of an implicit price, the alimony, which makes the parties adopt the optimal behavior. More precisely, the specialization of the wife results from the common objective to maximize the joint marital income and the expected enforcement of alimony by the court in the case of a divorce is a necessary and sufficient condition for adopting the optimal behavior. But Landes's analysis does not explain how the two spouses coordinate with each other, or how they negotiate the specialization. There is no explicit or implicit coordination because the specialization is simply the result of a maximization program. In other words, Landes's economic analysis of alimony is a model of production and allocation of commodities, with some consideration given to distribution, but it is not a bargaining model. The economics of contracts can be used to provide another approach to alimony, by providing precisely economic tools for analyzing the bargaining between agents when there are some transaction costs, asymmetric information or specific investments. 2.3 .Justification for Alimony Based on the Economics of Contracts The justification for alimony that emerges from a contract-based ap- proach is a good illustration of the dialogue between law and econom- ics on this topic. Indeed, in contrast to the previous analysis, the con- tract theoretical approach to alimony was not developed first by economists, but by the legal scholar Lloyd Cohen, who used tools com- mon to the economics of contracts to justify alimony (Cohen 1987). Even if from an economic point of view this approach could appear het- erodox when compared with Landes's orthodox analysis, this concep- tion of alimony is compatible with an economic approach. One of the aims (but not the only one) of this analysis is also to fashion an efficient law of divorce, including the issue of alimony.1 Even if it is not a legal contract, marriage is often considered to be one and divorce is seen as a breach of that contract (not only by econ- omists, but also by some lawyers). This analogy is based on the idea that marriage could be compared to a partnership between the two spouses. It is also justified by the commitments of the spouses to each other. Many authors point out, however, that it differs from a long-term com- 1 «Precisely, because marriage is a species of contract, many of the problems inherent in fashioning an efficient and equitable law of divorce, alimony, and property division are varia- tions and special cases of the difficulties that surface in the enforcement of commercial con- tracts» (Cohen 1987, 267).

Cohen (1987) argues that even if marriage has an in- strumental value (like a long-term commercial contract) because spous- es may be considered as inputs enabling the production of an output (Becker's traditional approach), above all, it has a value in and of itself (religious or spiritual value, proof of love). From this point of view, marriage is a way of exchanging promises of support, whose value depends on the behavior of each spouse over the long term. But as in all long-term contracts, there is a problem of opportunism. More pre- cisely,1 the problem stems from the specific investments made by wives whose gains are shared asymmetrically over time. At the beginning of the marriage the wife makes a major contribution (education of the children and total or partial withdrawal from the labor market), while the husbanďs is low. The wife receives the gains of the long-term mar- riage when she benefits from her husbanďs resources once the children have been raised. In contrast, the husband enjoys the gains of marriage immediately (the comfort of being married and of family life), but pays the cost over time. The risk is that the husband adopts a strategic behav- ior that consists in breaking the contract when the wife is to receive the largest share of the gains generated by marriage. The optimal strategy for the husband consists in leaving his wife without compensation once she has made her contribution to the marriage (Geddes and Zak 2002). According to Dnes (1999), this is the «greener grass effect», according to which the husband could be induced to breach the marriage before 'paying' his spouse for her investment in the family, and go to live with another, younger woman. The solution consists in making the breach of contract expensive for the opportunistic party. Alimony would, in this regard, be a way of pre- venting opportunism: in the event of divorce, the wife knows that she would be compensated for her investment in the marital relationship. Alimony is considered as an award of damages. This thesis, defended by the two lawyers Brinig and Crafton (1994), reexamines the idea of mar- riage as a relational contract. They call for a new contractual approach to marriage, considered as a long-term relational contract, to take into account the risk of opportunism within the couple. In other words, the switch from the fault divorce to a no-fault system exposes some spouses to the opportunism of the other because the marriage can now be ter- minated by one spouse at any time, virtually without compensation for the other. The problem is all the more important when one party has made household-specific investments, un-redeployable on the market, or when he/she has invested a lot in the career of his/her spouse. The 1 The discussion in the remainder of this section is based on Bourreau-Dubois and Do- riat-Duban 2013.

The Debate Between Legal Scholars on the Two Approaches to Alimony The first discussion highlights criticism of the idea of specialization de- riving from efficiency and so questions the appropriateness of an eco- nomic analysis of alimony (3. 1). The second discussion is about the sim- ilarity between a contract and the marital relationship, the economics of alimony being mobilized to formulate this critique against the con- tractual approach (3. 2). 3. 1. Criticism of Efficiency and Specialisation The main criticism of the efficiency theory comes from 'feminist' lawyers, who argue that because it is focused on specialization and giv- en that the spouse who invests in the domestic activities is generally the wife, this approach contributes towards keeping women in economic dependency. Indeed, Singer (1994, 2437) explains, «For feminists, perhaps the most troubling aspect of the dominant economic theory of alimony is the theory's reliance on the efficiency - and hence the desirability - of role specialization during marriage». As has been mentioned before, from Becker s perspective, alimony is a means of encouraging efficient behavior during marriage. This effi- ciency theory is based on three assumptions: first, married persons are rational individuals who maximize their individual welfare; second, the individual welfare is maximized through the production and the acqui- sition of commodities (including household commodities); third, specialization within marriage enables spouses to maximize their joint production of market and nonmarket commodities. It is this last as- sumption which is the most criticized by Singer, on the basis that it re- sults in making women economically dependent on their husband. As she explains: «The efficient household, under this model, was one in which the husband specialized in market production and the wife special- ized in domestic work» (Singer 1994, 2431). Consequently, she disagrees with the result of this efficiency model in which alimony is justified giv- en women's specialization in domestic activities. Even if feminist lawyers recognize that modern efficiency theorists prefer to characterize alimony as a compensation for decreases in hu- man capital or as a way of improving incentives to behave efficiently, they are not convinced by the approach wherein the conclusions are aí- This content downloaded from 50.236.80.176 on Fri, 06 Jan 2023 18:39:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 156 Cécile Bourreau-Dubois and Myriam Doriat-Duban ways gender-biased. They reproach economists like Parkman (2000) and lawyers like Ellman (1989) for being candid about the central role of spe- cialization in the economic analysis of alimony But above all Singer (1994, 2438) considers that «this attempt to justify alimony as a mecha- nism for promoting efficient specialization within marriage is problem- atic on grounds that are both internal and external to economics». Inter- nally, the economic analysis considers only specialization between husbands and wives but not specialization amongst women. This criti- cism is developed by other feminist lawyers (Carbone 1990; Brinig 1993) according to whom «from a pure efficiency standpoint, the most produc- tive household today may be one in which both spouses engage in full- time market work and the bulk of the domestic tasks, including child- car e, are performed by a low-wage employee» (Singer 1994, 2439). Externally, the criticism is based on the psychic costs of specialization. Thus Brinig (1993) explains that for many couples, an efficient marriage is not characterized by a high degree of specialization but rather by a sit- uation in which both partners have significant ties to the paid labor force and spend significant time with their children. Singer (1994, 2440) finally uses these arguments to give 'the coup de grâce' to the economic analy- sis of alimony and concludes, «if specialization within marriage is not efficient, then the economic justification for alimony evaporates. Alimo- ny is no longer necessary to encourage 'optimal role allocation or to remove 'distorting incentives' to otherwise efficient marital behavior». According to Singer (1994), marital specialization is also problematic be- cause it ignores the effect on bargaining power within couples. The risk is particularly high for housewives, because the skills they develop in their household are valueless in the job market. This has a direct effect on the wife's bargaining power. More precisely, Bergmann (1981, 84) writes: The power that a husband now has to terminate his marriage to a housewife and thus to reduce considerably her standard of living and her status has effects on those housewives whose marriage has not terminated. First of all, there is the worry that the marriage may terminate. Second, the husband may use the implicit or explicit threat of leaving to achieve dominance in the relationship, to the detriment of the housewife's feelings of wellbeing. In other words, specialization decreases the bargaining power of wives as it involves them reducing their market activity. If a husband's bargaining power is all the greater, as his outside-marriage alternative options are good and the wife's are bad, it follows that the bargaining power of wives decreases with their degree of specialization in nonmarket activities, with this negative effect being particularly high for housewives.

Marriage is not a Contract Even if it appears to have many of the attributes of a contract, marriage is not a contract from a strictly legal point of view. The consequences for alimony are important. Indeed, if marriage is not a contract, alimo- ny cannot be justified on the basis of a breach. In other words, awarding alimony on contractual grounds depends on whether or not one of the spouses has respected his or her contractual commitments. Following this argument, alimony should be awarded only if the breach can be proven, in which case it would be considered as a damage remedy from one spouse to the other. Once again, with this type of justification, al- imony is related to the non-respect of some commitments, more often implicit than explicit. An intermediary conception could consist in considering marriage as a relational contract such as exists in commercial transactions. Howev- er, the aim of the relationship in the two cases is not the same: whereas commercial relational contracts have a clear and common financial ob- jective, the aim of the marriage is the relationship itself. Cohen (1987) argues that a commercial contract only has an instrumental value: it is a way of obtaining something from the co-contracting party in ex- change. The content of the contract matters, not the relationship be- tween the two parties. Marriage also has an instrumental value because, according to Becker's traditional approach, spouses may be considered as inputs enabling the production of an output, the family. Above all, marriage has a value in and of itself: it has a religious or a spiritual value and it is considered by many as a proof of love. From this point of view, marriage is a way of exchanging promises, in other words, the commit- ments of the two spouses are subjective and not necessarily properly and commonly anticipated. The main problem is that the terms of the marriage contract are not explicit. There is then a risk that the court awards alimony on the basis of its preferences about the commitments in the marriage, not on the basis of the real mutual commitments be- tween the two spouses. Thus Ellman (1989) denounces the excessive analogy between the contract and marriage which leads to alimony being awarded as if it were a damage remedy for breaching the contract. More precisely, he refuses to justify alimony by promises. Nevertheless, he admits that di- vorce can cause some losses. To justify alimony on commitments, he proposes to determine the problems that a contract cannot solve but which are real and which represent losses for the wife. By doing so, he explicitly refers to Landes's theory where alimony induces marital in- vestments by ensuring compensation for the wife, in the event of di- This content downloaded from 50.236.80.176 on Fri, 06 Jan 2023 18:39:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 158 Cécile Bourreau-Dubois and Myriam Doriat-Duban vorce, for her investment in the household to maximize the joint mari- tal income. This means that Ellman implicitly adopts the normative economic conception of alimony and considers that the function of al- imony is to encourage marital investment by eliminating distorting in- centives. Ellman (1989, 51) thus concludes: The theory offered here is fundamentally different from contract analysis. To think of alimony in contract terms is essentially to look backwards. We ask what deals were made and what promises were relied upon, and we fashion a remedy that vindicates reliance on those promises. By contrast, the proposed approach looks forward; it generates alimony rules that encourage the kind of marital behavior we want. 4. Reconciliation of the Two Approaches The two previous parts have presented how some legal scholars have drawn from economic analysis some arguments to justify the award of alimony and how these scholars have had a debate on the appropriate- ness of their respective arguments. This last part shows that from an economic point of view the two approaches advocated by the legal scholars are not fundamentally incompatible. 4. 1. Economic Analysis of Alimony is not Gender-biased Singer, Brinig, Carbone and Crafton refuse the economic analysis of alimony developed by Landes because they consider it gender-biased and contributing to the perpetuation of gender inequalities in the cou- ple to the detriment of women. If, in a way, one can effectively re- proach Landes for conducting a gender-biased analysis that supposes that only women can invest in domestic activities, it is quite excessive to apply this criticism to the economic analysis of alimony in general. More precisely, in this analysis, women's specialization in nonmarket activities is not an objective, but a consequence of a rational behavior consisting in maximizing the joint marital income. Specialization re- sults from the differences in hourly wages between men and women and thus the differences in the opportunity cost of decreasing or inter- rupting his or her professional career. It must be noted that Becker (1973; 1974; 1981), unlike Landes, does not suppose that only women can invest in domestic activity. In Becker's theory, the optimal choice may be that the husband makes the household-specific investment if the hourly wage differences are to his disadvantage, which leaves room for a possible alimony for the husband in the event of divorce. In com- parison to the 1970s, it is likely that such a choice has become more widespread today with some recent studies (Bloemen and Stancanelli 2015) showing that in a significant proportion of couples, the woman This content downloaded from 50.236.80.176 on Fri, 06 Jan 2023 18:39:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Law and Economics of Alimony 159 is the main earner (whether she out-earns her husband or her husband is not employed).1 Lastly, the optimal choice for a couple may be not to have either spouse specialize in one type of activity: if the wife and the husband have the same career opportunities, an optimal sharing of professional and domestic activities would involve neither spouse specializing. The investment of each spouse will depend on his or her bargaining power and probably on other considerations as well (especially the pleasure of bringing up his/her children). Thus, an economic analysis could prob- ably be improved by integrating non-economic considerations and the spouses' relative bargaining power. Specialization as a result of the effi- ciency objective is however not a sufficient reason to reject the econom- ic approach. There has been a step forward with Fethke (1984, 269), who states that «one interesting feature of the Nash-bargaining model is that it offers an explanation of the conditions under which alimony payments might be an attractive arrangement for the couple». But she supposes that bar- gaining powers are equal in the sense that any gain from bargaining is equally divided between the two spouses. McElroy and Horney (1990) justify the Nash-bargaining model to study household decisions and ex- plain that this type of model can be very useful for rules to determine alimony and child support, but unfortunately they do not develop this point of their analysis. More recently, Kraft and Stebler (2006) have shown how rules of alimony impact the choice of activity of each mem- ber of the couple in the labor market and in this way also impact their decision to divorce or to remain married. However, the authors do sup- pose that alimony corresponds to a rule of equal sharing of income af- ter the couple has separated; in other words, they assume that parties have symmetrical bargaining power. The aim of their paper is therefore to analyze, using a Nash-bargaining model and a Becker s altruism model, whether this rule leads, all things are equal, to more divorces or fewer. But unfortunately, they have not studied the efficiency of the considered sharing rules. As they explain (572), «the next step will be to include efficiency in the analysis, defining efficiency e.g., as advantages from specialization during marriage in that one partner concentrates on home production and may after divorce suffer from a depreciation of his/her initial human capital». This future study could be useful to 1 In this field, it is interesting to note that, according to a recent study (Sayer et al. 2011), when men are not employed, there is a greater likelihood of the marriage ending, with either the husband or the wife initiating the end. For the authors of this study, this result can be explained by the fact that men's breadwinning role is still so culturally mandated that when it is absent, both men and women are more likely to find that the marital partnership does not deserve to continue.

Theoretical and Empińcal Reconciliation between the Two Approaches Ellman s criticism of the contractual approach to alimony led an econ- omist to develop a real economic analysis of alimony, based on the eco- nomics of contracts. Bolin (1994) disputes Ellman s argument that Lan- dest approach is superior to contractual settling of a divorce, and proposes to reconcile the economic and contractual approaches. The starting point of Bolin s analysis is the same as that adopted by Landes. Spouses are faced with a problem of allocation of the wife's time between the market and the household; the more time she spends in the household, the less she develops her human capital. In this con- text and if the risk of divorce is introduced, with no compensation paid to the wife in the event of divorce, the wife will choose an inefficient level of household-specific investment. Alimony is efficient if the wife has no incentive to deviate from the jointly efficient level of investment in the marriage-specific capital. However, Landes's rule for alimony does not give a unique measure of spousal support. More precisely, Lan- des determines the unique optimal level of specialization that corre- sponds to the maximization of the joint marital income and the out- come does not depend on its distribution between the two spouses. She then determines the efficient alimony corresponding to this unique op- timal specialization. This result comes from the fact that the share of the total income perceived by each spouse is exogenous. In other words, the bargaining power of the parties is not taken into account. However, the way the total income is shared between the spouses depends on their respective bargaining powers. Bolin shows that any efficient rule for alimony must be founded on the spouses' agreement regarding the division of the joint marital income. He criticizes Ellman for not recog- nizing the difficulties of inducing efficient marital behavior without knowing the sharing rule. As mentioned previously, alimony leads to an optimal specialization resulting in an increase in the joint marital income relative to the situa- tion without alimony. This benefit from specialization may go entirely to the wife or to the husband, or be split in any intermediate combina- tion, with no impact on the joint marital income. In other words, there are different ways to share the benefits of marital cooperation in the event of divorce and they all result in the same total maximal marital in- come. Bolin next examines the two extreme measures of efficient al- This content downloaded from 50.236.80.176 on Fri, 06 Jan 2023 18:39:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Law and Economics of Alimony 161 imony, between the highest acceptable amount for the husband and the lowest acceptable amount for the wife. He shows that not only are these two measures efficient, but they are also very similar to two remedies for breach of contract: restitution and reliance. More precisely, he shows that a measure of alimony in which the wife receives all the ben- efits from her marital cooperation (i.e., the expected alimony for the wife is equal to the expected gain to the husband from the wife investing in the jointly efficient level instead of the individually efficient level) not only creates optimal incentives, but is also «confusingly similar to the restitution remedy for breach of the marriage contract if divorce had been considered as breach by the husband» (Bolin 1994, 497). Converse- ly, when the alimony corresponds to the lowest acceptable measure be- cause the wife is just compensated for her loss from increasing her mar- riage-specific investment, it «bears a strong resemblance to the reliance remedy for breach of the marriage if divorce had been considered as breach by the husband». Bolin adds that «this measure is efficient since the wife is totally compensated for her expected losses from investing in marriage-specific asset» (Idem, 498). Finally, it appears that the economics of alimony founded on effi- ciency and a contractual approach are in fact complementary: the for- mer justifies awarding alimony to lead spouses to adopt an optimal spe- cialization between household activities and labor market activities, while the latter shows that the optimal amount of alimony must re- flect the way the spouses share their joint marital income. The difficul- ty with the contractual approach is then to determine the explicit or implicit agreement between spouses, but that does not mean the ap- proach is not relevant to justify alimony. This is exactly Bolin s conclu- sion (Bolin 1994, 502) it is clear that the approach to divorce proposed by Ellman (and Landes) must be based on contractual considerations. Moreover, the efficiency-promoting rule for al- imony proposed by Landes corresponds to slightly modified versions of the tradi- tional remedies for breach of contract. If Bolin provides a theoretical reconciliation between the economic and the contract approaches to alimony, economists Sofer and Sollogoub (1994) provide some empirical elements to reconcile these two ap- proaches. They do not propose any theoretical analysis of alimony, but assume that there are several types of marriage, some of them being nearer to a traditional conception, others closer to a modern concep- tion, given that each of them results in a specific justification for award- ing alimony. More precisely, Sofer and Sollogoub define three types of marriage. The first is the investment-type marriage, which corresponds to Landes's model, in which it is optimal that the wife specializes in do- mestic activities, at least partially The second is the trade-type mar- This content downloaded from 50.236.80.176 on Fri, 06 Jan 2023 18:39:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 1Ó2 Cécile Bourreau-Dubois and Myriam Doriat-Duban riage, corresponding to Becker's analysis, in which the spouses search for the best partner according to their respective personal qualities and the complementarity or the substitutability between them. The third is the association- type marriage, in which the two spouses conclude a contract about the nature of their common projects relative to the pro- duction of goods and services and to their children's education. De- pending on the type of marriage, the justification for awarding alimony is different. In an investment-type marriage, alimony is justified by the marriage-specific investment of the wife. In the trade-type marriage, al- imony is justified by the loss of expected gains due to the divorce. Final- ly, in the association-type marriage, alimony is justified by the breach of the contract by one of the spouses. Using data from French courts in the mid of 1980s, Sofer and Sollo- goub determine the main factors explaining whether or not a woman will obtain alimony after divorce. They then infer from these results the implicit marriage model used by the judges when they make their decision. Econometric tests lead the authors to reject the hypothesis of trade-type marriage (which is not studied either by lawyers or by other economists in analyzing alimony). Even though the other two models seem to be relevant, the most likely is a hybrid model which includes determinants from both types of marriage (investment and associa- tion). The authors conclude that the relevant determinants for alimony are, first, the breach of the contract by the husband (consistent with an association-type marriage) and, to a lesser extent, the marriage duration, the labor market participation of the ex- wife and the income gap between the two spouses (consistent with an investment-type marriage). 5. Conclusion In this paper, we show that the 'no-fault divorce révolution' has resulted in creating a legal theoretical vacuum about justifications for alimony, which had been a cause of concern for some American legal scholars by the early 1990s. We study how these same legal scholars have mobilized two alternative economic approaches, based on efficiency for some and contract for others, and how they have discussed the relevance of their respective reasoning. Finally, we show that these two approaches are more complementary than competitive, from an economic point of view. From an economic perspective, it would be interesting to supplement this discussion on the alimony justifications by questioning whether alimony is the best way to protect the spouse who has specialized in domestic activities during marriage against the risk of living standard This content downloaded from 50.236.80.176 on Fri, 06 Jan 2023 18:39:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Law and Economics of Alimony 163 losses in the event of divorce. Indeed, if marriages are more and more often a partnership, is a prénuptial contract not a better way to cover this risk? The solution would then be ex-ante and not ex-post. But once again some difficulties could emerge. Indeed, Rainer (2007) develops an analysis in favor of the marital contract where spouses can negotiate a better contract for themselves than the distribution of assets fixed by al- imony For others, like McLellan (1996) and Spier (1992), however, prénuptial contracts favor the spouse who has the stronger negotiating power. If the weaker spouse cannot be protected by the prénuptial con- tract, then it is the role of the judge to protect him or her and so alimony remains an efficient means. More generally, it would be interesting to enlarge the discussion on the protection of individuals when the relationship is terminated. This issue is relevant for three main reasons: cohabitation has increased dra- matically in Western countries; the gendered division of labor remains a feature of modern family life, and, in many countries, marriage tends to confer more legal rights and obligations than cohabitation (Bianchi et al 2014). This question is particularly relevant for European countries, which have a crude marriage rate of around 4 marriages per 1000 people while, in the United-States, the rate is around 7 per 1000. Finally, this is just the beginning of a future and rich debate among European law and economics scholars. References Allen D.
