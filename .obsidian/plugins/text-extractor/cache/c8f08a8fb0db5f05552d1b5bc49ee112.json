Historically, I have had a social (learned behavior) bias when attributing or understanding people's social selves. In fact, with the exception of strictly natural phenomena, I have almost always favored the nurture position in \"nature vs nurture\" conversations. Our textbook did a fantastic job of repeatedly looking at causal relationships from multiple perspectives. Evolutionary vs Social In Chapter 5, we were exposed to the Universality of facial expressions. This was a compelling argument for both universal emotions, and their reﬂection in our culturally situated expression of emotion. Discovering that these expressions were not just limited to humans but also our primate cousins, was particularly impactful. On the topic of universal emotional expression, I was particularly surprised to learn of the derivation of our expression of embarrassment. In retrospect, it seems so obvious that this stems from a primitive expression of appeasement, and that such displays could \"short-circuit conﬂict and trigger afﬁliation\" (Gilovich, et. al. 2024). This was the moment in the semester when I really started to see the \"nature\" side of the argument as compelling. Gender Another perspective shift that I experienced during the semester was the degree to which gender (or at least cultural enforcement of gender norms) impacts our social experience and expression. Our textbook made reference to gender in every chapter, but I found the impact of gender on self-construal to be one of the more impactful, personally. Given how central self-concept is to our personal experience of the world, it seems like this facet of social psychology could have ﬁlled an entire textbook. As the father of a transgender child, and a person of ﬂuid gender identity, this section helped me to understand the severe dysmorphia and dysphoria that trans people experience, in a new and powerful way. The idea of working self-concept also underscores how incredibly valuable LGBTQI+ spaces are from the perspective of stabilizing one's self-schema in a world that may not always provide a conducive reﬂected self-appraisal. Inter/Intra-group Identities Chapter 7 was captivating for me in that it made several connections between different group identities (cultural, gender, age, and class/SES). It was in reading this Chapter that I really came to appreciate the importance of considering each of these group identities when trying to understand social behavior and its attribution. In discussing system justiﬁcation theory our textbook offhandedly mentioned that some women feel that they deserve to make less money than men, illustrating how prevailing persuasive messaging can lead to self-defeating attitudes within some groups. In the terror management theory section, we learned how mortality salience manipulations could be used to fractionalize a group into hostile sub-groups (e.g. Christian Americans vs Muslim Americans). Conclusion As I have mentioned, this course has illuminated the importance of considering the full spectrum of contexts that inform and explain human psychology. Whether we look at a person or situation through a Biological, Psychodynamic, Socioeconomic, Behavioral, Cognitive, or Social psychological dimension will have a tremendous impact on how we choose to address the person or situation. Social Psychology has provided a practical appreciation for how one might go about generating a more holistic view of causal relationships by looking at them from several perspectives (e.g. group membership, biology and evolution, or lived experience). In addition to this general exposure and maturation of my understanding of the complexity of human psychology, I am particularly grateful to take from this course two speciﬁc pieces of wisdom: First, \"Whether a massage lasts 20 minutes or an hour or whether a ﬁrst date lasts 1 hour or 10 has very little effect on our recollections of pleasure. What matters most is the quality of the experience at its peak and at the end\" (Gilovich, et. al. 2024). And last but certainly not least, the recipe for how to be happy: ● A little bit of money (You don't need more than $75,000/year) ● Gratitude ● Generosity ● Experience > Stuff ● Experience Awe I am so grateful to have had the privilege of attending this class and sincerely look forward to learning more about the workings of the psyche, through social perspectives and others.
