It is important for you to have a basic knowledge of human development, the domains and expected milestones at each stage, the factors that impact development, and how you can best support a child who has a developmental delay or mental health disorder. This module is an introduction to child development, including sexuality. It also includes information about working with youth who do not have permanency. Upon completion of Module 7, you will:  Identify the stages of typical child development.  Recognize risk factors of potential delays or disruptions in development.  Understand typical sexual development, as well as special considerations for individuals with developmental delays.  Understand the concept of “Dignity of Risk.”  Identify key elements for successful transition to adulthood.  Understand the unique challenges for youth without permanency and be able to provide effective support services. Typical Child Development A child’s life includes distinct periods of development. These periods are referred to as stages. Predictable milestones exist within each stage that typically occur in the four developmental domains: • Social-emotional • Language/communication • Cognitive (thinking, learning, problem solving) • Movement/physical development These domains are interconnected and affect each other. Each stage of development from birth to adulthood is complex, and many theories (Erikson, Piaget, etc.) attempt to explain why a child may engage in certain behaviors during development. As a BHP, having a comprehensive understanding of BHP Module 7 – Child Development 6 these stages and the child with whom you are working will help you to set realistic expectations regarding his abilities, and it will allow you to implement developmentally appropriate interventions. Human development is an intricate process that is influenced by a number of factors, both genetic and environmental. Genetic factors include inherited traits: • Physical, such as height • Nonphysical, such as temperament Chromosomal disorders, such as Down Syndrome and Fragile X Syndrome are genetic abnormalities that affect development. Environmental factors include nutrition, the family culture, and the home environment. Factors that have a detrimental effect on healthy growth and development include things like neglect, abuse, poor nutrition, lead poisoning, and in utero exposure to toxins such as alcohol or drugs. Exposure to one or several of these factors potentially puts a child at risk for mental, physical, or cognitive disorders (Arnett & Maynard, 2013). Regardless of abilities, all human beings proceed through developmental stages from birth to death in the same order, but at a unique pace. Each stage builds on the previous one. The timing, approach, and effort required for mastery will vary from child to child. There are seven basic, universal principles of development. Development: 1. Proceeds from the head, downward – Cephalocaudal principle. 2. Proceeds from the center of the body, outward – Proximodistal development. 3. Depends on maturation and learning – Biological development follows a sequential pattern; for example, an infant crawls before standing, and puberty occurs before full growth. An individual must mature to a certain level before new skills can be acquired. A child cannot stand until he has the strength and motor-control to do so. This aspect of development is influenced by both the individual child’s genetics and his environment. 4. Proceeds from simple to more complex. 5. Is a continuous process. 6. Is orderly – From general to specific, from large muscle movements to more refined. BHP Module 7 – Child Development 7 7. Is unique – Occurs at an individual rate; for example, one child might take his first steps at 11 months old, and another may not until he is 18 months old (Arnett & Maynard, 2013). Developmental Stages The milestones that are expected at each stage of development can be categorized into four domains: social/emotional, language/communication, cognitive, and movement/physical. These milestones are the developmental “norms” – what most children are able to do by a certain age. See Table 7:1 on the following pages. Take care to remember that these are generalizations and that wide variation exists along the developmental path, especially if the child has a developmental disability or trauma history. The areas of development vary within the individual child. A child’s social development may progress more quickly than his emotional development or vice versa. Growth and development in children do not necessarily occur at a constant and steady pace. A child may have periods of sudden growth, periods of little to no observable growth, and even periods of regression. Regression is the apparent loss of skills. When a child masters a skill in one domain, such as walking, he may appear to lose an already acquired skill in another area, such as talking. Because of the physical and emotional energy needed to achieve a particular developmental milestone, children may temporarily regress. Typically, once a child has successfully mastered the developing skill (walking) he will return to his previous level of mastery in the other skill (talking) and continue to make progress.

Consider in which areas of development the child has grown within the expected time frame and which milestones the child has yet to reach for his or her age and stage. _____________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________ Healthy Growth and Development A number of environmental factors can either interfere with or support healthy development. It is the responsibility of parents and caregivers to provide a nurturing and safe environment in which children can grow and develop. Unconditional acceptance, encouragement, and guidance are key ingredients of a healthy family environment in which children feel safe and have the resources needed to succeed. According to the American Psychological Association, relationships between caregivers and children that are warm, open, and communicative, include appropriate limits, and provide reasons for rules for behavior are associated with fewer negative outcomes in children. This process begins in infancy. Donald Winnicott, a British pediatrician and psychologist once said, “There is no such thing as a baby...if you set out to describe a baby, you will find you are describing a baby and someone. A baby cannot exist alone, but is essentially part of a relationship” (Winnicott, 1966). The bond between an infant and his caregiver, also known as attachment, is established in the early months of life and becomes increasingly more complex as the child grows. Healthy attachments are formed when caregivers are available and responsive to their infant’s needs. BHP Module 7 – Child Development 18 How are healthy attachments formed? • Child has a need and feels distressed – cold, hungry, in pain • Child expresses that need – fussing, crying • Caregiver responds by meeting the need quickly and affectionately • Child is soothed (quiescence) A child whose needs are consistently met has a reasonable sense of comfort and safety, which is essential for healthy growth and development and has implications for the child’s future relationships. Some research suggests that approximately 40% of children do not develop secure attachments with their caregivers (Sutton Trust, 2014). A number of factors contribute to poor parent and child bonding such as: • Parents who may find the child’s temperament difficult to deal with; for example, he or she might struggle when caring for an infant who is very active, requires less sleep, or cries often. • Parents who have mental health issues, like addiction or depression. • Parents who did not have secure attachments with their caregivers. • Very young or inexperienced parents with poor parenting skills. • Separation from the primary caregiver and/or frequent moves or placements. Caregivers who are loving and are attuned to their child’s needs are better able to respond warmly and appropriately, providing the optimal environment as their child proceeds through the developmental stages. These caregivers are sensitive and flexible. They anticipate their child’s needs and make adjustments to provide for those needs based on the child’s temperament. Need Displeasure Need Satisfied Quiescence BHP Module 7 – Child Development 19 Temperament describes each child’s natural style of interacting. Research by Alexander Thomas and Stella Chess has identified nine temperament traits that form three basic temperament profiles in infants: easy, difficult, and slow-to-warm-up (Thomas & Chess, 1970). Research suggests that the characteristics of a child’s temperament typically continue into adulthood (Rettew & McKee, 2005). However, much depends on the environmental and social influences on an individual’s life. Because of the importance that infant- caregiver bonding has on the development of the child, much attention is given to the interplay or “dance” between the child’s temperament and his caregiver’s temperament traits. Children who exhibit high levels of activity or inability to attend, or who are not easily soothed may be described as having a difficult temperament. A parent may find it challenging to adapt to his or her child’s temperament, which can have a negative effect on the child’s attachment to the caregiver and may have implications regarding the child’s mental health. Theories of Development The chart below outlines how we can imagine a child’s world-view as the child proceeds through development. As a child develops, his world-view broadens beyond his own perspectives to include the perspectives of others. As the child moves through his development, he starts to see himself less as the center of the universe and more as a unique member of the universe. Stage Age Description Infancy 0 – 1 year old Center of the Universe Toddlerhood 1 – 3 years old Master of the Universe Preschool 3 – 5 years old Member of the Universe School Age 6 – 12 years old Increasingly sophisticated member of the Universe Adolescence 12 – 18+ years old As mentioned previously, a number of theories of human growth and development attempt to provide a framework for understanding personality development and motivations for thought and behavior. Let’s look at a few. Jean Piaget (1896 – 1980) Piaget was one of the first psychologists to conduct a systematic study of cognitive development. His theory describes how children learn about and BHP Module 7 – Child Development 20 adapt to their world. Prior to Piaget’s work, little was known about how children acquire, organize, and apply knowledge. Piaget suggested that children progress through four stages of intellectual/cognitive development. The core concepts of Piaget’s theory are Assimilation, Accommodation, Adaptation, and Schema. Piaget rejected the notion that intellectual development was simply about adding knowledge. Rather, he viewed children as “little scientists” and asserted that intellectual development involved reasoning and changes in how children think. His theory was influential in the field of education, particularly in the 1960s to 1980s. His work has since been criticized because of concerns about his methodology and the nature of the stages. Sigmund Freud (1856 – 1939) One of the earliest and most well-known theories of development is Sigmund Freud’s Psychoanalytic Theory. In the early 1900s, Freud proposed that early childhood experiences have a lasting effect on an individual’s development. He theorized that the structure of the personality was comprised of the id, ego, and superego and that it develops through a series of five stages in which the pleasure-seeking energies become focused on certain erogenous areas. The primary motivation for behavior, according to Freud, is anxiety, either conscious or unconscious. Freud asserted that if each stage is successfully navigated and resolved, the result is a healthy personality. If not, the individual may remain “stuck” or “fixated,” which has implications for difficulty into adulthood. According to Psychoanalytic Theory, fixations are the results of either not having one’s corresponding developmental needs adequately met – creating frustration or overindulgence – causing a reluctance to move on to the next stage. Though now largely disputed, Freud’s influence is still felt in our society. Erik Erikson (1902 – 1994) Erikson added the social dimension to his psychosocial developmental theory. He was the first to propose that the stages continue through our whole lifespan, not just during childhood. A main element of his theory is the development of “ego identity,” which is the conscious sense of self. He introduced the concept of “identity crisis.” Erikson believed that a sense of competence is what motivates behavior. Each of his proposed eight stages of development is linked to becoming competent through a central conflict that is influenced by social experiences. Similar to Freud, mastery or positive resolution BHP Module 7 – Child Development 21 at each stage leads to healthy growth and development. Lack of resolution may lead to a sense of inadequacy and other challenges. Review Table 7:2 to learn more about the Early Developmental Theories.

Although the contributions of Freud, Erikson, and Piaget create a foundation and are well- known, their theories are considered outdated and incomplete, giving way to emergent theories. Other developmental theories focus on a particular aspect of development. Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg expanded on Piaget’s work and identified six stages of moral development as the basis for ethical behavior. Carol Gilligan, one of Kohlberg’s research assistants, later criticized his work as being gender-biased. In her 1982 book, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory of Women’s Development, Gilligan asserts that women approach moral dilemmas differently from men, from an “ethics of care” rather than Kohlberg’s “ethics of justice.” She states, “The very traits that have traditionally defined the goodness of women, their care for and sensitivity to the needs of others, are those that mark them out as deficient in [Kohlberg’s theory of] moral development.” Behaviorism is a branch of psychology that focuses on the aspects of behavior that are observable and measurable and is less concerned with the internal mental state of the individual. Social scientists, John Watson, Ivan Pavlov, and B.F. Skinner are some of the major thinkers who influenced behaviorism. Behaviorists assert that all behaviors are acquired through conditioning – the individual’s interaction with the environment. Applied Behavior Analysis is the application of behaviorism and has been shown to be effective in treating autism and other disorders. Later in this course, we will take a closer look at these concepts in Module 11 – Understanding and Managing Behavior. John Bowlby’s work in the mid to late 1900s focused on the quality of the infant-mother bond. Bowlby believed that the first few years of life establish the blueprint for all future relationships. His research suggests that adverse childhood experiences, such as violence within the primary caregiving system, disrupt healthy attachment and have implications for mental illness or developmental delays. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study conducted at Kaiser Permanente from 1995 to 1997 has proven the connection between childhood maltreatment and negative behavioral and health outcomes such as chronic depression, alcohol abuse, obesity, and more later in life. BHP Module 7 – Child Development 25 Developmental Delays and Mental illness A child is considered to have developmental delays when he has not reached developmental milestones by the expected time period. Developmental delays can arise in any area of development. Due to the interconnected nature of domains, it is not uncommon for a child to have delays in more than one domain. For example, if a child is having difficulty with his speech/language, this could also influence his social-emotional domain and his cognitive domain. Some mental disorders begin in childhood and impact the child’s functioning – cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral. A 2009 report from the National Council and Institute of Medicine estimates that up to one in five children experience a mental disorder in a given year. We will look more closely at various mental disorders common to the populations that you serve, as well as how diagnoses are determined in the next module – Children’s Behavioral Health. Genetic and/or environmental risk factors can result in developmental delays and/or mental health disorders. The greater the number of risk factors, the greater the risk for delays. Some mental disorders have a strong hereditary component, because the disorder tends to run in families. Environmental factors include: • Prenatal damage from poor prenatal care or nutrition; exposure to toxins such as drugs or alcohol; high levels of maternal stress • Infection or disease passed from the mother to the infant during pregnancy • Premature birth and/or low birth weight • Poor nutrition • Poverty • Abuse and/or neglect The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened during well-child visits at 9 months, 18 months, and 24 or 30 months. At these check-ups, the parent is asked to fill out a questionnaire (Ages & Stages Questionnaire – ASQ-3) about the child’s development. This information helps the pediatrician recognize developmental delays. Depending on the physician, the forms may be slightly different; e.g., there might be one general form or one form for each domain of development. BHP Module 7 – Child Development 26 At various stages throughout growth and development, a child may exhibit behaviors that are difficult to discern between “normal” and a cause for concern. When working with a child, things to consider are: • What is considered typical for his developmental stage? • What are the frequency and intensity of the behavior in question? • What is happening in the environment that may be having an impact? • Does this behavior represent a change in development, either progress or regression? • How is the child’s ability to function being impacted? • Is the child a danger to himself or others? As a BHP, it is not your job to diagnose. You are a valuable member of the Treatment Team, and your accurate and objective observations of the child and his behavior provide helpful information that guides the services that the child receives. Communicate with your supervisor any concerns that you may have about the child’s development. Human Sexuality Sexuality is part of child development, too. Everyone has sexuality, including children with developmental delays and mental health disorders. Discussing sexuality and personal boundaries with children can be difficult for even the most seasoned parents. It becomes even more challenging when dealing with children and adolescents with cognitive, emotional, and behavioral challenges. However, because research has shown that children with developmental disabilities or children who have histories of trauma have an increased risk of being sexually abused or exploited at some point in their life, it is imperative that parents and caregivers educate their children about their bodies, how to set personal boundaries, and how to stay safe. Typical milestones exist for the different stages of development. As a BHP, you must be able to recognize what is “normal” sexual behavior and what sexual behavior might be a “red flag” or problematic. During the preschool years (3-5), children will have questions about differences in gender, body parts, toileting, hygiene, pregnancy, and birth. They are also likely to explore their genitals and show or look at other children’s private body parts. It would be uncommon for a child of this age to have specific knowledge of sexual acts or sexual language. BHP Module 7 – Child Development 27 Once children reach school age (6-8), they will have questions about physical development, relationships, sexual behavior, and menstruation, and they might want more specific information about pregnancy. The child may be exploring with same gender children during games or role-playing, and he may be engaging in some self-stimulation in private. If the child is engaging in adult- like sexual interactions, has knowledge of specific sexual acts, or is behaving sexually in a public place, he is demonstrating signs that would be a cause for concern. During preadolescence (9-12) children become more complicated because they experience a number of hormonal changes. There will be an increase in sexual awareness and feelings, which will be intensified by the media, peers, internet, etc. School-age children will have questions about relationships and sexual behavior, and they will start using sexual words and discussing sexual acts and values with their peers. There could be an increase in experimentation with romantic relationships, and self-stimulation is expected to continue. These behaviors will most likely happen in private. If the child is acting out sexually in public places, this behavior should be addressed. Adolescents (13-18) will need more detailed information to help them make informed decisions about relationships, personal values, and the consequences of sexual behavior. Self-stimulation in private is expected to continue. Sexual experimentation with peers is likely. It is not typical for an adolescent to express sexual interest in much younger children, but if this behavior is observed, the BHP should report the behavior to a supervisor. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 in 6 boys and 1 in 4 girls are the victims of sexual abuse before the age of 18. A child with a disability or mental health issue has an increased risk of being a victim of abuse. Children with cognitive or emotional challenges are easy targets for predators because they are more vulnerable. The child may not have a way to communicate that something has happened to him. The child may have received little to no sexuality education and not know what is a safe touch and what is not. A child should be taken seriously if he reports any form of sexual abuse. As a BHP, it is not your job to provide sexual education. If and when questions arise, you should follow the family’s lead. Speak to your supervisor about the kinds of questions that the child is asking and advocate for the treatment plan to include goals about preparing the child for age-appropriate BHP Module 7 – Child Development 28 information. You can help protect the child with whom you are working by reinforcing appropriate social and physical boundaries and personal safety. Social Boundaries Social boundaries are the rules of social interaction or social etiquette between individuals in a variety of social settings. Social Boundaries guide our behavior in situations that we encounter frequently and are the shorthand way of figuring out how to act. These boundaries create expectations of others’ behavior and a sense of mutual comfort. We learn social boundaries from a variety of sources, including caregivers, peers, and the media. We have typical social boundaries that reflect the place, the time in history, and the culture in which we live. Areas of Social Boundaries include: • Physical Contact • Language • Trust • Self-Disclosure Characteristics of Social Boundaries: • They are mutually agreeable. • They are learned. • They change slowly over time. • They are situation and culture specific. Some situations occur when it is permissible to cross social boundaries such as hugging someone on his birthday whom you would not normally hug or touching someone during a medical emergency. In these or similar situations, the boundary is safely crossed when: • Both people benefit from having crossed the boundary. • The boundary is crossed only long enough to accomplish a specific task. • The least intrusive way to accomplish a task is selected. • As soon as the unusual situation is over, both people return to the original boundary. Boundaries are violated when: • One of the people involved is harmed or exploited. BHP Module 7 – Child Development 29 • The change is accomplished through force, threat, coercion, trickery, or manipulation. • When the situation has passed, there is no return to the previous social boundary. Dignity of Risk Supporting a typically developing adolescent through his teen years can be challenging in itself, but it can be especially challenging if the adolescent also has a developmental delay. All adolescents need to have the chance to figure out who they are through experimentation with clothing, music, relationships, etc. This need is true for adolescents with developmental disabilities as well. However, this self-discovery can be difficult for adolescents with developmental disabilities because they have fewer opportunities to engage in the experimentations necessary for finding their identity. “Dignity of Risk” is a concept that was introduced by Robert Perske in the 1970s. He was an advocate for individuals with developmental disabilities, and wrote several articles about the discrimination that individuals with developmental disabilities face. In his article “The Dignity of Risk and the Mentally Retarded” Perske (1972) states: Denying the [developmentally disabled] exposure to normal risks commensurate with their functioning tends to have a deleterious effect on both their sense of human dignity and their personal development. In addition, the removal of all risk diminishes the [developmentally disabled] in the eyes of others. In this article, Perske shows how appropriate and reasonable risk-taking can and should be worked into the daily living experiences of individuals with developmental disabilities. As a BHP, you will want to be aware of opportunities for the child to take some risks. These risks may result in failure or disappointment, which is part of the learning process. Dignity of Risk does not mean allowing children to engage in reckless activities, but instead allowing them the opportunities that their typical peers have. Transition to Adulthood All children’s behavioral health services, whether home and community based or provided in the school, rehabilitative support services for children with cognitive and functional limitations, or treatment services for children with BHP Module 7 – Child Development 30 mental health needs, are intended to increase the child’s skills and adaptive behaviors. Parents, caregivers, and providers are mindful of the importance of preparing children to live as independently as possible. Many of the children with whom you work will grow into self-sufficient adults, able to work and live independently. Some may require varying levels of support services into their adult life. About the time a child who is receiving services reaches the age of 14, the team should begin planning for adulthood. While this may seem early, many things need to be initiated, discussed, and decided before the child graduates from high school. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) youth in Maine receiving special education services are entitled to transition services beginning no later than the 9th grade or at age 16, whichever comes first. Special education services in Maine end when a student either graduates with a regular high school diploma or turns 20 years old and completes the current school year. According to Wrightslaw (2018), an organization founded by Attorney Pete Wright and his wife Pamela Wright, MSW, “the term ‘transition services’ means a coordinated set of activities for a child with a disability that: A. is designed to be a results-oriented process, that is focused on improving the academic and functional achievement of the child with a disability to facilitate the child’s movement from school to post-school activities, including post-secondary education, vocational training, integrated employment, continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living, or community participation; B. is based on the individual child’s need, taking into account the child’s strengths, preferences, and interests…” The transition to adulthood is not a linear process and can be quite complex. This is a time for the family and team to begin discussing long-term goals. Whenever possible, the child should also be involved in these discussions. The child’s ITP and IEP will start to include goals related to a successful transition to adulthood. The goals may be related to socialization, post- secondary education such as college or vocational training, work readiness and employment, transportation, domestic skills, safety, money management, self- advocacy, and health care skills. The child should begin to attend team BHP Module 7 – Child Development 31 meetings consistently, whenever possible and appropriate, and he should begin to learn basic advocacy skills. Depending on the nature of the disorder or disability and the level of adaptive functioning, some children will qualify for services into their adult life while others may be discharged from treatment. The child may start to undergo evaluations and adaptive testing that will determine eligibility for adult services. Additionally, depending on the individual needs of the child, some parents may have concerns about their child’s ability to make responsible decisions for themselves, even when their child becomes an adult. In the absence of any legal proceedings, once an individual turns 18, the young adult will be considered his own guardian and the family will no longer have decision- making power in most or all areas of his life. If parents have such concerns, the team may begin to discuss the guardianship/conservatorship process to determine the option that best suits the needs of the young adult. When the young adult reaches the age of 16, the parent(s) sign the early notification form which is sent to the DHHS Family Information Specialist, who will make contact with the family to discuss issues of guardianship and the transition into adulthood. When applicable, the team and family may also begin working with the young adult to make changes to Social Security benefits (SSI) and health insurance, as well as other behavioral health services. The system of care changes when the child becomes a young adult. If the young adult is deemed ineligible for DHHS mental health or developmental services, he will be advised about the eligibility decision appeal process and the timelines for completing this process.

Youth in this population are in one of three categories: • Homeless • Emancipated • V-9 Status Homeless youth are sometimes referred to as unaccompanied youth. The U.S. Department of Education defines these young adults as “individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence” (2004). They are without parental, foster, or institutional care and may be living in temporary settings such as emergency shelters, hotels, or camp grounds. They may have been abandoned by their legal guardian in hospitals, or they may be waiting for placement in foster care or residential treatment. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, approximately 50,000 youth in the U.S. sleep on the street for six months or more (2015). Dosomething.org (2015), an online organization committed to supporting young people and social change, has compiled the following statistics regarding homelessness: • One in five young people under the age of 18 will run away at least once. • 34% of the total homeless population is under 24 years old. • Approximately 40% of homeless youth identify as Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, or Questioning (GLBTQ). • Of youth who run away, 41% have been abandoned by their parents for at least 24 hours, and 43% have been abused by a caretaker. Emancipated minors must be at least 16 years old and refuse to live in a home provided by both/either of their parents or legal guardians. A young person who seeks emancipation by filing a petition must be able to prove that he has a plan for taking care of his own basic needs and that it is in his best interest to become independent of parents/guardians and assume responsibility for his own care. DHHS Office of Child and Family Services (OCFS) administers the Youth Transition Services program for older youth in DHHS custody. These are youth who: • Turn 18 years old while in foster care BHP Module 7 – Child Development 34 • Were adopted after the age of 18 and experience a disrupted adoption • Reside with his birth parents, but are under DHHS oversight due to child protective issues. Through this program, these youth may sign a Voluntary Extended Support Agreement (V-9) to receive extended placement and other supports to help with things such as getting a high school diploma or GED, attending a post- secondary education program, and receiving continued behavioral health services. According to the 1999 Child Welfare Legal of America report, after leaving foster care: • 55% had completed high school • 42% reported having been arrested • 40% of young women reported a pregnancy (many unplanned) • 30% reported having no housing or having to move frequently. Youth without permanency have a unique set of challenges and a unique experience of family. As a BHP, you must be sensitive to the complex ways in which these young people think and feel about family. Many of them have experienced trauma and loss within their family of origin and lack meaningful connections with adults. They likely have a deep desire to belong to a family and may have a family that they have created for themselves. Additionally, they have developed survival strategies that may or may not be effective or ideal. Be sensitive and respectful of their survival skills, but be aware that they may be presenting a persona of competence that is different than their actual skill level. As a BHP, you are in a position to mentor these youth. Mentoring is based on the premise that predictable, consistent relationships with stable, competent adults can help youth cope with challenges and steer clear of high-risk behaviors. Within the boundaries of your professional relationship with the young person, you may provide guidance and support to help him build his self- confidence, learn pro-social behaviors, stay in school, and avoid potential pitfalls such as substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and illegal activity. Building a strong working alliance based on dignity, respect, and recognition of a young person’s strengths will help you to effectively support him. BHP Module 7 – Child Development 35 Conclusion As you have seen throughout this module, child development is a complicated process that is influenced by a number of internal and external factors. As a BHP, you are not expected to be an expert on child development. However, having a basic understanding of the stages of development can help you better support the child with whom you work. Additionally, knowing some of the obstacles such as the difficulties that the child may be facing with social boundaries or transitioning into adulthood can better prepare you to support the child.
