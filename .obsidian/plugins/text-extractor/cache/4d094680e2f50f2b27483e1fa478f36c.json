The philosophy of the jurisdiction regarding this issue should inform an attorney's presentation of the issue (i.e., the position you take on behalf of your client should be consistent with the prevailing policy of your jurisdiction). Some jurisdictions look at alimony as a tem porary fix until marital property is divided. Others look at alimony as a temporary fix until the supported spouse can get his or her skills up to the level of self-support (or contributing to that support). Yet other jurisdictions see alimony as a means of enforcing the marital contract (i.e., the financial means of providing the supported spouse with the \"benefit of his/her bargain\"). However your jurisdiction approaches the con V&NTS TO Know By DIANNA GOULD-SALTMAN trial alimony presentation judicial impact cept of alimony, some presentations are more like ly than others to yield a receptive judicial audi ence. As an attorney, you cannot create the facts, but you can marshal them, organize them into a clear presentation, tie them to the law the court is obliged to apply, and present them in a manner that invites a positive response. Here's how. Alimony might be addressed dur ing at least three stages of a divorce: pretrial, at trial, and post trial. Pretrial alimony might be raised (to set sup port) at the time of an initial filing or at other hearings prior to trial (especially if it takes a while to get to trial) when there has been a change of circumstances. Posttrial alimony pro ceedings may be upon request to terminate alimony, to augment alimony (less common), or to modify alimony, based on some change of circumstance or triggering event. 28 FAMILY ADVOCATE www.ambar.org/familyadvocate WHAT THE JUDGE V&nts to Know How to structure your pre trial alimony presentation for maximum judicial impact DIANNA GOULD-SALTMAN This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000198.255.226.140 on Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:28:23 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms The initial request An initial request for alimony will set the stage for how finances are likely to be addressed prior to trial. For this reason, it is critical that the request is well-organized and well-pre pared. One disadvantage is that, at the early stages after parties separate, you will have the least information because discovery has just commenced, if it is commenced at all. Prospects for the parties' future income and the length of time to trial are also speculative at this stage. That does not mean that you don't have a roadmap to- get you where you need to be. First check your jurisdiction's current version of any statute addressing alimony. Often that statute will identify the factors a court must consider in making an order for alimony. From the statute, develop the facts and the evidence that supports those facts, so that your presentation supports your request. If some facts tend to point away from your desired goal, don't ignore the \"bad\" facts. Acknowledge them, address them, and deal with them. If the facts are dispositive (your client just won $10-million in the lotto, but seeks alimony anyway, because your client earned less or nothing at all during the mar riage), reconsider your request, not just your approach. If some cases have facts similar to those of your case and support your position, gather your evidence so that you are not just sub mitting an argument and making an analogy, but you are providing evidence that the court can match up with the facts in the supporting case to yield a similar outcome. If you find yourself filing a request for tem porary alimony in a case in which there is already opposing counsel, consider entering into some stipulations or at least proposing them. In the best case, you will be successful, saving both clients time and money by resolving the entire issue outside of court. In the worst case, you will not have reached an agreement on anything, but your attempts to resolve this without litigation, assuming your proposal is reasonable, might be considered in the future on the issue of attorney's fees in jurisdictions that allow for fee-shifting based on litigation conduct. By \"stipulation,\" I don't necessarily mean that you and opposing counsel will agree on the amount and duration of alimony, although that is one possibility. Agreements on component parts of alimony help the court to focus on areas of .disagreement. Stipulations save the court time and save your clients money by limiting hearings and preparation time to those issues in dispute. For example, if both parties are W-2 wage earners, entering into a stipulation as to their respective incomes would make sense, rather than putting on evidence about that. Focus on areas of disagreement. Is there a con tention that one is underemployed? Is there an issue about the availability of overtime? Is dura tion at issue but not the amount of support? Narrow the areas in controversy, and you will impress the court with (a) your mutual cooper ation and (b) your efficiency at using your hear ing time wisely. The stipulations need not all be substantive. It is extremely helpful to the court if counsel stipulates as to the foundation for exhibits so that laying foundation does not consume court time where there is no serious issue that an exhibit lacks foundation or requires extra wit nesses just to lay the foundation. Likewise, it is useful if counsel can stipulate to the admissibil ity of evidence if there is no serious contention that it is inadmissible. Save the contest of admissibility for testimony or exhibits, which are both material and prejudicial. If the authen ticity of a document is not really in question, enter into a stipulation as to that, rather than using court time and additional witnesses just to authenticate documents. This is especially true for documents such as school records and telephone records, unless the authenticity is really in question. It also may be useful to enter into a stipulation that declarations/affidavits come into evidence as the direct testi mony of the declarant, subject to cross-examination and supplementa tion. This saves time with duplication of testimony. While, arguably, it limits some of the credibility-testing value of direct testimony, that is what cross examination will cover. Finally, it may be valuable to stipulate to the expertise of certain experts who will testify, whether for you, the opposing side, or as the court's own expert, if the exper tise is not really in question. There are times when you might elect not to, even when the witness is well-known to the court, such as when the expert's If some facts tend to point away from your desired goal, don't ignore the \"bad\" facts. Acknowledge them, address them, and deal with them.

This is a strategic decision; however, to the extent that counsel can eliminate procedural and substan tive differences by stipulation, you reduce the cost of litigation for your clients, earn the appre ciation of the court for your efficiency, and benefit by allowing the court to focus on the important issues at hand. Temporary support The standards for temporary and permanent alimony are different in some jurisdictions. If your state statutes or case law describe those differences, line up your facts with your statutory or case law and don't try to put on the wrong case. If your state law has different standards to be applied, but does not expressly state the basis for the dif ference, you can extrapolate. It is not difficult to envision that temporary alimony may be to try to maintain the status quo as closely as possible, whereas long-term alimony is for a different purpose. Can the preseparation standard-of-liv ing/status quo be maintained once the parties are living separate and apart? Generally, it is not likely, because supporting two households will cost more, but with the same amount of income. For that reason, except in extremely high-asset cases, it makes little sense to argue entitlement to the preseparation status quo, even if the goal is to try to emulate that. Instead, demonstrate how the income should be allocated fairly, accepting for the moment that we are \"dividing a pie,\" not increasing the size of it. Make a proposal that anticipates and acknowledges that both spouses will likely have to scale down the standard of liv ing to be able to live in two households on the same income. Responding to the initial request Three of the most common mis takes attorneys make in respond ing to requests for alimony are (1) raising issues that are not relevant to alimony in an attempt to deflect the issue, (2) failing to address relevant issues raised in the moving papers, (3) acting as if the issue is binary, and (4) trying a case parallel to that of the requesting party. Here is what I mean and how to avoid these mistakes. In my experience, both on and off the bench, alimony can be a touchy subject, especially for the person being asked to pay it. A paying party needs to conceptualize the marriage as a partnership. And just as with all 50/50 part nerships, partners may bring different contribu tions to the relationship, but share in the pro ceeds equally. This concept often is emotionally difficult for clients. Some clients will want to raise all kinds of issues to cast aspersions on the requesting party. The idea is that if the requesting party doesn't look like someone who is worthy of receiving alimony, the court might not order it. In some jurisdictions, such as those in which fault of some kind is considered among the fac tors in determining alimony, it may be appro priate to present evidence of the facts that would lead a court to conclude that an award of alimo ny is not appropriate. Even in those jurisdictions, a presentation that dispassionately sets out the facts and allows the court to draw its own conclusions based on those facts will go a lot farther than a declaration/affidavit full of hyper bole and exclamation points. Your presentation, even then, should be of the facts, not the conclusions. Let the court draw its own conclu sions. If you set out the facts in a clear and linear fashion, the court should be able to draw the conclu sion you intend. As more jurisdictions adopt no-fault statutes, the issue of \"fault\" becomes less relevant legally; although, for the parties involved, not necessari ly emotionally. This is why it is so important that attorneys really know and understand the statu tory and case law of their jurisdiction regarding alimony. It may be hard to sell your services when you must tell a prospective client, \"Under the facts of your case as you've given them to me, you're not likely to get the results you're hoping for.\" Nevertheless, do your client the greatest ser vice: be as honest and up-front as possible and serve as the voice of reason, giving the client real istic options and your best representation, rather than a supportive pat on the hand. Withstand the pressure to throw everything that might smear the requesting party into the affidavit/dec laration as a show for the client. This approach is unlikely to get the results you want and really demeans you in the eyes of the court. Your presentation should be of the facts, not the conclusions. Let the court draw its own conclusions 30 FAMILY ADVOCATE www.ambar.org/familyadvocate This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000198.255.226.140 on Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:28:23 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms If the other side raises issues that are relevant to alimony, but adverse to your client, do not ignore them. Your failure to mention them in a responsive pleading, if they are significant, will allow those facts to stand in an unfavorable way for your client. Better to share with the court: Sure, your client won the lottery last year, but those net proceeds were already split between the parties. The fact that the other side spent his on a sports car and your client put hers in T-bills should not entitle the other side to alimony, based on the interest your client generated by being frugal. This argument goes a lot further than leaving the court to ponder only the alle gation that your client won the lottery, and nothing more. A corollary to this is that you should refrain from getting sucked into the fray when the other side raises emotionally charged issues that are not relevant to the issue of alimony. For example, in a no-fault state, alimony largely may be a question of numbers, primarily income. If marital infidelity is irrelevant on the issue under the laws of your jurisdiction, but the other side raises the issue, what do you do? If that fact is relevant to some other issue also being .heard, you may have to address it responsively. If it is not, say so. Cite the statute or case law that says so. Do not fear offending the bench officer by spelling out in an accompanying memoran dum of points and authorities factors the court, by law, is required to consider and the absence of factors raised in the moving papers. Sometimes responses to requests for alimony will urge the court that it has only two choices: alimo ny as requested or no alimony at all. If your juris diction's law actually says that, follow that law and marshal your facts accordingly. However, most jurisdictions do not take an \"all or noth ing\" approach. Assuming yours does not, do not bait the court by challenging it to give all or nothing. You have a fifty-percent chance of get ting your worst-case scenario. Instead, consider your client's real exposure for an order to pay alimony, the range of likely orders, and make your client look eminently reasonable by offer ing at least something in that range, especially if this is for a temporary order. Have your client start making good-faith payments within that range, preferably by stipulation to be made into a court order, if the parties are likely to be filing separate tax returns. It has been said that lawyers are linear thinkers. So are judges. Use the roadmap of your juris diction's statutory or case law as a checklist and fill in the facts as they fit. For example, many states expect the court to make its ruling on alimony based, in part, on the standard of living during the marriage. Marshal your facts step by step to provide a \"word picture\" for the court of what these parties' standard-of-living was like. Provide concrete, preferably recent, examples, which the court can relate to a particular stan dard of living, whether modest, middle-class, upper-middle-class, or wealthy. Then provide evidence, preferably in the order in which the factors appear in the statute, to demonstrate what you're trying to prove. Other common fac tors include duration of the marriage, earnings or earning ability of each party, marketable skills of each party, length of the marriage, length of time either party has been out of the job market, issues that might impact employability, and income-producing assets. As you can imagine, the best evi dence usually costs more than useless or less useful evidence. For example, the testimony of a vocational evaluator, who has interviewed the subject party, conduct ed relevant tests, and done a labor-market analy sis of jobs for which the subject is likely to qual ify, is probably the gold standard for an \"earnings ability\" case, whether you wish earnings imput ed to the payor or the erstwhile recipient. Rarely does such analysis come cheap. It may, however, be possible to hire such an evaluator to do a labor-market analysis alone if, for example, the subject has recently lost a job and has a track record of employment. Doing so in a case where the subject hasn't worked in years runs the risk of paying for a market analysis that the court may ultimately find irrelevant. Admissible evidence of an earnings history also is useful information for a court regarding the range of future employ ment income that might be expected.
