The profession of social work has a special role to play in ensuring access to basic needs through advocacy, service provision, legislation etc. It is important that social workers are knowledgeable about and familiar with local, state, regional and national resources that meet basic needs. They should also be aware of the shifting and evolving nature of availability, in that, what is provided when, where and to whom changes over time. For this assignment, students will be introduced to artifacts at the Osher Map Library that include maps and other informational resources. Students will select one basic need they have an interest in exploring. Examples of basic needs include: food, housing, education and medical care. They will then analyze artifacts from the Osher Map Library (OML) collections that offer information on the extent to which select individuals and communities had access to resources and services to meet that need. For example, students may decide to examine a map that shows the number of hospitals located in a specified geographic area in the 1950s. They will then also ascertain what access to hospitals looked like within the same geographic area today, thereby analyzing needs, trends and gaps. Additionally, students will discuss whether and how the profession of social work has or should play a role in helping to secure or improve access to services and support to address the need area.
