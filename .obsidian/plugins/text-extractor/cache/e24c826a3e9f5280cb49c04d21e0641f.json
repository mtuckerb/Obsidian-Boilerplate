In this article, we ask: what are the administrative agendas latent in coastal access in California? Using webscraping, we collected over 10,000 staff reports prepared by the Commission between 1996 and 2016 and examined how the agency used the permitting process to attain its missions. Using the topic modeling technique, we identified 18 key administrative agendas in the staff reports pertaining to public access. These agendas reveal a wide spectrum of environmental protection strategies that the Commission pursued along with maintaining public access. While some of these topics narrowly focus on coastal accessibility (e.g. easements, trails and paths), and utilization (e.g. recreational activities, piers, parking), many of them extend beyond and cover broader, more controversial environmental agendas, such as shoreline and sensitive habitat protection. We also explored the stability of these administrative agendas over time. We observed notable stability in these efforts in the past two decades, despite personnel changes.

The Hollister Ranch in Santa Barbara County is located behind guarded gates.2 It features three beach cabanas and 8.5 miles of private beach frontage that are used exclusively by the owners of the parcels within the Ranch. After three decades of stops and stalls, the fight to open up access to the beach is far from over. Similar disputes over public access to the California coastline have played out in various parts of the state, including Santa Cruz,3 Morro Bay, 4 and Malibu. 5 These battles over coastal public access have often been highly visible and contentious.6 Several landmark legal cases reshaped how the California Coastal Commission governs the coastline. In particular, Nollan v. California Coastal Commission in 1987 considered whether a permit condition constitutes substantial advancement of a legit- imate state interest. The Nollans argued that the imposition of an easements condition in exchange for rebuilding their property constituted a taking without just compensa- tion. The case illustrates how governmental bodies must clearly establish that the imposed permit condition does in fact address the adverse impact of the development on the community (Crew 1990; Finnell 1989; Neronha 1989). There is no doubt that these visible legal battles have shaped the operations and redefined the powers and limits of the California Coastal Commission in obtaining public access. However, in this article, we argue that these visible legal battles are only the tip of the iceberg. The bulk of the work that was done to open, maintain, and manage public access lies in the permitting process. The term “permitting process” refers to the process in which an applicant can legally apply for a permit to perform or conduct an operation or activity in a jurisdiction. Using an original dataset of permit applications and staff reports between 1996 and 2016, this article sheds light on this rather hidden permitting process. In particular, we focus on the questions: have latent administrative agendas been pursued during the permitting process? If so, what are the latent administrative agendas of the California Coastal Commission pertaining to coastal access? To answer this question, we used the topic modeling technique to identify 18 dimensions of “administrative agenda” related to public access. Some of these agendas focus narrowly on access (e.g. easements, trails and paths), and many of these agendas extend beyond access and cover controversial topics, such as sensitive habitat protection and the construction and maintenance of shoreline protective devices. Our findings reveal how the permitting process is used as a policy tool for coastal management and regulation. Within a span of two decades, despite various changes in personnel and state political climate, these administrative agendas have been relatively stable over time. 1.1. Background of California Coastal Commission The California coastal zone spans approximately one mile in width along the Pacific Ocean coastline of the state. Figure 1 highlights the zone in pink. The zone covers sev- eral major conservation areas, including Malibu and the Santa Monica Mountains. The zone features a limited supply of premium real estate for competing interests that range from housing to business to recreational activities. The California Coastal Commission is a state agency with quasi-judicial regulatory oversight over land use and public access in the coastal zone. The agency was formed by a ballot proposition, Proposition 20, in 1972.7 The ballot campaign was initially 1128 I. Hui and M. Gorkovenko formed in reaction to a controversial development surrounding the Sea Ranch, a planned coastal community in Sonoma County. Peter Douglas, who later became the first executive director of the Commission, championed the campaign to create the bal- lot and later crafted the California Coastal Act. 8 1.2. Public access according to the California Coastal Act As written in the California Coastal Act, Section 30530, one of the Act’s key legisla- tive intents was to create “a program to maximize public access to and along the coast- line be prepared and implemented in a manner that ensures coordination among and the most efficient use of limited fiscal resources by federal, state, and local agencies responsible for acquisition, development, and maintenance of public coastal accessways.” 9 Figure 1. A map showing the geographic coverage of the California Coastal Zone. Journal of Environmental Planning and Management 1129 Section 30210 states that “maximum access” and “recreational opportunities”“shall be provided for all the people consistent with public safety needs and the need to pro- tect public rights, rights of private property owners, and natural resource areas from overuse.” Section 30211 requires that development shall not interfere with the public’s right of access to the sea. Section 30212 requires, with few exceptions, new develop- ment projects to provide public access from the nearest public roadway to the shore- line and along the coast. Section 30212.5 encourages public facilities, including parking areas or facilities, to be distributed throughout the coastal zone to avoid over- use or overcrowding of any single area. Section 30213 encourages the provision of lower-cost visitor and recreational facilities. Within the Coastal Act, Section 30252 specifically pertains to the maintenance and enhancement of public access: The location and amount of new development should maintain and enhance public access to the coast by (1) facilitating the provision or extension of transit service, (2) providing commercial facilities within or adjoining residential development or in other areas that will minimize the use of coastal access roads, (3) providing non-automobile circulation within the development, (4) providing adequate parking facilities or providing substitute means of serving the development with public transportation, (5) assuring the potential for public transit for high intensity uses such as high-rise office buildings, and by (6) assuring that the recreational needs of new residents will not overload nearby coastal recreation areas by correlating the amount of development with local park acquisition and development plans with the provision of onsite recreational facilities to serve the new development. Section 30214 further delineates the legislative intent and implementation of public access policies. The public access policies need to consider topographic and geologic site characteristics; consider the capacity of the site to sustain use and at what level of intensity; limit public access in fragile natural resource areas; and protect the privacy of adjacent property owners as well as the aesthetic values of the area. Specifically, the Coastal Commission is charged to consider equities and balance “the rights of the individual property owner with the public’s constitutional right of access.” 1.3. Public access according to the California public access report The Commission published a comprehensive report on public access in 1999. The report lays out three top priorities. The first is the Offer-to-Dedicate (OTD) public access easements program. The second is extending the California Coastal Trail and providing a continuous passage along the entire length of the state’s shoreline. The third is prescriptive rights, which mandate that new development should not interfere with the public’s right of access to the sea in places where the public has historically used private property to get from the road to the shoreline, to traverse informal trails, or to use for recreational activities. In addition to these three priorities, the report identifies five additional issue areas. These include shoreline armoring, lack of public information about availability of coastal access facilities, inadequate parking, polluted water quality and actions that cause adverse cumulative impacts upon people’s ability to get to and use the coast, such as installing structures that encroach on beaches and easements, hosting commer- cial events on beaches, or eliminating parking. 1130 I. Hui and M. Gorkovenko 2. Methods The Coastal Act has defined the legal premises of public access. The Commission has laid out a comprehensive agenda in print pertaining to public access. The key empir- ical questions are: what are the latent administrative agendas pertaining to coastal access? And how consistent are these administrative agendas over time? Little has been written on the permitting process as an administrative tool to shape a bureaucracy’s desired outcomes. Part of the reason the permitting process is largely ignored in the literature has to do with the lack of organized and accessible data. The permitting process begins with an application, which is then subject to staff review before getting a decision from the Commission. Thousands of applications generate tens of thousands of pages. Valuable information often gets buried in article trails. Studying the permitting process requires sifting through tens of thousands of pages of documents, which is a labor-intensive process. To make the permitting process transparent, this project developed an original dataset that includes all permit applications, meeting agenda items and corresponding staff reports that appeared in the Coastal Commission monthly hearings between 1996 and 2016. The Coastal Commission has archived these documents online since 1996. Figure 2 shows a screenshot of a typical meeting agenda. Each agenda item also con- tains a URL link to a staff report associated with the case, mostly in PDF format. Using webscraping, all these meeting agendas and their corresponding files were scraped and converted into text format. With text parsing, all the relevant information was compiled into a database. Figure 2. An example of the Commission’s website where webscraping was done to extract empirical data. Journal of Environmental Planning and Management 1131 Altogether, this data collection process curated over 15,000 items and their corre- sponding staff reports over two decades. A staff report can span from 10 pages to over 200 pages. That means each staff report would have at least several dozens, if not hun- dreds of paragraphs. Since this article only focuses on the public access aspect, 77,587 paragraphs were extracted in the staff reports that included the phrase “public access.” This screening is important, as it helps to reduce the size of the textual corpus, making it much more efficient and empirically relevant. To clean the data, all these paragraphs were converted into lowercase so that “coastal” and “Coastal” would count as identical words. White spaces and punctuation, as well as stopwords (such as “an”, “the”, “is”, “was”), were removed. Stopwords are frequent words that appear in paragraphs but have little distinct meaning. To further reduce the number of words in documents, all words were stemmed. For example, words such as “protect,”“protects,”“protecting,” and “protection” were reduced to the root-form “protect.” Stemming the documents could reduce redundancy while retaining the core meaning of the words. A final Term-Document matrix was created where each row contained a unique word and each column represented a document. The Term-Document matrix was large. It contained over 110,000 unique words and about 78,000 paragraphs. The content of the matrix counts the frequency of occurrence of each word in each paragraph. Once the paragraphs were pre-processed, topic modeling was used to retrieve latent dimensions in the text. Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling technique for discovering the abstract “topics” or hidden semantic structures that occur in a collec- tion of documents. The “topics” produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words. See Technical Appendix for a full description of the technique. Figure 3. Four metrics used to identify an ideal number of topics, the metrics concur at 18 topics. 1132 I. Hui and M. Gorkovenko Similar to principal component analysis, one challenge with topic modeling lies in deciding the number of latent topics. On the one hand, one wants to have more topics so as to capture the full spectrum of underlying diversity. On the other hand, too many topics would make interpretation difficult and would pick up nuisance differences instead of substantive distinctions. For efficiency, this project set the upper limit of topics to 20. Four different metrics (see Nikita 2016) were used to evaluate the ideal number of topics, namely, Griffiths and Steyvers (2004); Deveaud, Sanjuan, and Bellot (2014); Cao et al.(2009) and Arun et al.(2010). In sum, the goal is to find the minimum values for the first two metrics and max- imum values for the latter two. As Figure 3 shows, 18 topics appear to be the most commonly agreed upon value. Based on these metrics, topic modeling was performed with 18 topics. Each topic would capture one dimension of the administrative agenda of the Commission in the permitting process. 3. Results Altogether, 18 distinct topics were retrieved from the permit applications and their cor- responding staff reports between 1996 and 2016. Table 1 summarizes these topics and lists the 20 most frequent words in each topic. Based on these results and the authors’ reading of the relevant texts, the meaning of each dimension was interpreted. Due to limited space, the frequent words for each of the 18 topics are reported in the Online Appendix. The Online Appendix also provides one sample paragraph for each dimension for illustration. In this section, these 18 topics were further organized into six major themes and to show how the topics are related to each other. These 18 topics reveal how the stated missions of the Commission were executed through the permitting process. As shown in Figure 1, the Commission has jurisdiction over the land and sea in the coastal zone. Access to the coastline can be by land or by sea. Some of the topics focus narrowly on accessibility, while many topics cover a wide spectrum of policy areas, including main- taining water quality, shoreline protective devices and protecting sensitive habitats. 3.1. Theme 1: land accessibility This main theme contains five subtopics: 3.1.1. Topic 7: easements During the permitting process, easements dedication is a way to open new public access. Topic 7 identifies languages that are used in these discussions. “Easements,” “offer” and “dedic(ate) refer to the “Offer-to-Dedicate” (OTD) program. A landowner can make an offer to the Commission to grant a public access easement across their property for future recreational use. The Commission then works with the property owners to turn the easements into a usable public accessway. These offers are typically irrevocable for a period of time, binding both current and future property owners. As of 2006, 1525 OTDs have been recorded; 79%, or 1200 OTDs, have been accepted. The majority of these OTDs are for lateral accesses, which are areas of land that pro- vide the public with access and recreational use along the water’s edge.

Hui and M. Gorkovenko 3.1.2. Topic 10: trails and paths Many of the accessways are in the form of public trails or paths. Topic 10 addresses this subject. Note that many of the discussions focus on a major work-in-progress pro- ject: namely, the California Coastal Trail. The Commission aims to provide a continu- ous interconnected public trail system along the state’s coastline. In addition, paragraphs on this topic often identify and address tensions between bicycles, pedes- trians and cars. Discussion of specific solutions to resolve these tensions is usually included as a permit requirement. 3.1.3. Topic 17: maintenance of access to coastal structures In addition, the Commission also tries to ensure that estuaries, marinas and coastal waters are open for boating, fishing and other recreational activities. Topic 17 captures a lot of discussion on this subject matter. The Commission oversees a variety of facilities, such as piers, docks and marinas, many of which provide opportunities for recreational activities and public access. In exchange for permit approval, some of the conditions include installing disability accessible docks, publicly accessible walking platforms above bulkhead walls, public restroom and kayak launch- ing areas. 3.1.4. Topic 3: protection of beaches Public access to beaches is a high priority for the Commission. The top five most fre- quent words under this topic are “beach,”“public,”“access,”“shorelin(e),” and “area.” The construction of a seawall or revetment would not only hasten the erosion of beaches, leaving tidelands inaccessible, but would also hasten the loss of horizontal or Table 1.

Many paragraphs address, in great scientific detail, how to protect beaches and beach access from erosion. 3.1.5. Topic 13: parking Parking shortage is a persistent problem, especially in popular coastline destinations. Topic 13 emphasizes the availability of parking spaces along with public access. When evaluating requests for special events, the Commission heavily weights how the event will affect traffic. In addition, the Commission also considers how parking fees will affect equity of access to the coast, as it insists that the coast is open for all to enjoy. Thus, while higher costs of parking may reduce the demand for parking spaces, the practice would disproportionately harm economically disadvantaged users, which is against the Commission’s goals. 3.2. Theme 2: protection of water quality and accessibility This second theme contains two subtopics: 3.2.1. Topic 1: maintenance of coastal waters accessibility Public access encompasses a much broader range of topics in the permitting process. Topic 1 addresses issues related to managing coastal water. For example, one of the heavily regulated tasks involves “dredg(ing).” Los Angeles County has two of the nation’s largest commercial ports and several major marinas and small-vessel harbors. In addition, there are numerous navigation channels and boating facilities that require regular maintenance of water depth. Dredging is needed to remove sediment and debris from the bottom of lakes, rivers, harbors and other water bodies. However, dredging may leave adverse impacts on the marine ecosystems near shorelines. As pollutants enter coastal waters, some of the sediment dredged may contain high concentrations of heavy metals, pesticides, and other contaminants. The dredging process and subsequent disposal of dredged materials require special supervision to prevent potential adverse effects on ecology and human health. Among paragraphs that score high on Topic 1, it is common to observe permit conditions that invoke the Coastal Act Section 30233. Through the permit application process, the Commission ensures that activities such as dredging, filling and diking are permitted only when there is “no feasible less environ- mentally damaging alternative,” and “feasible mitigation measures have been provided to minimize adverse environmental effects.” 3.2.2. Topic 4: Ballona lagoon and Venice’s grand canal Many paragraphs in this topic address the special environmental challenges in Ballona Lagoon and Grand Canal in Los Angeles County. Ballona Lagoon marine preserve is a 16.3-acre natural saltwater estuary. The Lagoon was originally part of the once-extensive 1,700-acre Balloon Creek wetlands, extending from Playa del Rey to Santa Monica. The lagoon was cut off from the wetlands with the develop- ment of Marina del Rey. It is on the 2,000-mile migratory route for birds, between Alaska and Latin America, known as the Pacific Flyway. The narrow layout of the streets around Marina del Rey, combined with limited street parking, makes these 1136 I. Hui and M. Gorkovenko areas almost traffic-free destinations near Venice Beach. A public walkway between the lagoon and private residences is covered by an easement for public access and habitat preservation. The Commission is particularly concerned with the increasing pollution from urban runoff and stormwater, the worsening water quality in the area, and the cumulative adverse impacts on the lagoon due to urban developments. 3.3. Theme 3: preservation of natural scenery This third main theme contains one subtopic: 3.3.1. Topic 5: sensitive habitats In addition to maximizing public access, the agency also attempts to strike a delicate balance between human uses and natural habitats. Marine and coastal resources pro- vide opportunities for aesthetic enjoyment and economic activities (Sivas and Caldwell 2008). Topic 5 addresses this issue. Sensitive habitats may include vegetation, native plants, birds, animal or marine lives. Two of the active verbs are “restor(e)” and “protect.” The frequent nouns are “habitat,”“resourc(e),”“site,”“wetland,”“plant,” “dune,”“speci(es),”“veget(ation)” and “use.” For example, in order to avoid impacts to environmentally sensitive dune habitats, many of the conditions restrict construction. In addition, the paragraphs in topic 5 often mention ESHA (Environmental Sensitive Habitat Act). The Coastal Act Section 30107.5 defines an “environmentally sensitive area” as “any area in which plant or animal life or their habitats are either rare or especially valuable because of their special nature or role in an ecosystem and which would be easily disturbed or degraded by human activities and developments.” The application of ESHA has been subjected to numerous controversies, such as in the case of the Santa Monica Mountains. The Coastal Commission has found that the Santa Monica Mountains’ ecosystem is itself rare and especially valuable because of its special nature as “the largest, most pristine, physically complex, and biologically diverse example of a Mediterranean ecosystem in coastal Southern California.” Under special circumstances like these, many projects that involve expanding human and eco- nomic activities in nature are subject to major regulatory scrutiny or rejection. 3.4. Theme 4: shoreline maintenance This fourth main theme contains two subtopics: 3.4.1. Topic 12: shoreline protective devices With global climate change, rising sea level has become a major concern, especially in a state with a long shoreline (Caldwell and Segall 2007; Hanak and Moreno 2012; Heberger et al. 2009; Heberger et al. 2011). Previous studies estimate that over 80% of the state’s coastline is actively eroding (Griggs, Patsch, and Savoy 2005). Shoreline protective devices have become increasingly important for several reasons. First, they are needed to guard against coastal erosion. Some areas, such as the coastlines of Santa Cruz and San Diego counties, are retreating at an average of a few centimeters Journal of Environmental Planning and Management 1137 to 60 centimeters per year (Moore, Benumof, and Griggs 1999). Shoreline devices may provide short-term safeguards against flooding related to storms or rising sea levels. As discussed, coastal armoring has been identified as one of the top priorities of the Commission. As of 2015, 110 miles, or 10% of the coastline, have been protected with some form of shoreline protective devices (Melius and Caldwell 2015). A major- ity of these protections were built in the 1990s; many of them are concrete seawalls. In a study of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, at least 15 miles of the Sanctuary’s 300-mile shoreline were armored with seawalls and riprap revetments (Stamski 2005). Coastal armoring affects the environment in several major ways. It is known to disrupt natural ecosystems (Cardiff 2001; Griggs 2005; Runyan and Griggs 2003; Stamski 2005). It also creates stronger waves at the tail ends of a seawall, result- ing in faster erosion on adjacent properties. Once a seawall is built, neighbors have lit- tle choice but to build their own to protect their properties against erosion. In addition, these seawalls are expensive to construct and maintain, and their lifespan is often much shorter than expected (Griggs 2005). Topic 12 addresses issues related to shoreline protective devices. Previous studies find that applications for seawall construction have the highest rejection rate (Hui 2017). The Commission staff reports reveal strong reservations toward “grey” solutions such as “seawall(l)” or “revet(ment),” as these can speed up coastal erosion. In addition, the tensions between two conflicting Coastal Acts, Section 30253 and 30235, are evident in the paragraphs. Section 30253 “instructs the Commission to approve the shoreline protective device if the device is still required to protect an existing structure in danger of erosion.” However, Section 30253 requires that a new development be “sited and designed such that it will not require the construction of protective devices that would substantially alter natural landforms along bluffs and cliffs.” This section poses the ques- tion: if a structure gets remodeled or redeveloped, would that constitute a “new” or “existing” development? This question often evokes lengthy debates in staff reports. 3.4.2. Topic 9: development on bluff Development on or near a bluff is the subject of scrutiny because bluffs are vulnerable to erosion. As discussed, the Commission imposes restrictive measures on shoreline protective devices. One of the measures is to ensure that new development be self- sustaining without any protective devices; paragraphs under this topic document how the Commission places strict scrutiny over the design and siting of new devel- opment or expansion of existing development. 3.5. Theme 5: construction and new developments This fifth theme contains two subtopics: 3.5.1. Topic 18: regulating construction Applications to build houses, apartment complexes, and commercial developments comprise the largest share of all applications in the study period (Hui 2017). Topic 18 reveals numerous requirements associated with construction permits. Some of these include containment requirements, work hour limitations, and prevention of pollution. The Commission asks for special care to prevent construction materials 1138 I. Hui and M. Gorkovenko or debris from entering coastal waters. Wood preservative, whenever feasible, needs to be treated at an onshore location to preclude the possibility of chemical spills into waters. 3.5.2. Topic 15: land use planning Topic 15 addresses land use planning. With any maintenance and repair, new construc- tion projects are usually not permitted to expand beyond their existing footprint. New development, particularly associated with hotels, resorts, or commercial properties, raises concerns for its cumulative impacts on coastal resources, such as increasing water, sewage or electricity. Paragraphs from this topic often weighted economic gains against potential damages to the environment. 3.6. Theme 6: administrative procedures and public engagement The last main theme contains the remaining 6 subtopics. In the spirit of local autonomy, the Commission shares regulatory authority with cities that have adopted a “Local Coastal Program” (“LCP”). Of the 76 counties and cities in the coastal zone, over 70% have adopted an LCP. LCPs lay out the ground rules for future development and protection of coastal resources, and they are reviewed by the Commission for consistency with Coastal Act requirements. After a new LCP or LCP amendment is officially certified by the Commission, coastal permitting authority over most new development would then be transferred to local government. The Commission retains permanent coastal permit jurisdiction over development pro- posed on tidelands, submerged lands, and public trust lands. The most frequent words in Topic 2 include “develop,”“plan,”“polic(ies),” “zone,” and “lup” (land use plans). Many of the LCPs were completed prior to the 1980s. In recent years, many of the paragraphs focus on revisions and updates to the LCPs. Public access is written as part of the requirements for recent amendments to the LCPs. New development, in particular, is required to maintain and enhance public access to the coast by facilitating extensions of transit service, as well as providing adequate parking spaces. Topics 6, 8, 11, and 14 cover some bureaucratic procedural language for permit consideration. Topic 14, in particular, addresses the appeal process. Topic 16 concerns the role of the Commission as a public agency. The Commission is tasked with provid- ing public information, educational activities, and public engagement opportunities. In addition to interacting with the general public, the Commission also has a lot of inter- actions with local and county officials and stakeholders. It takes an active role in com- municating increased awareness and engagement with coastal managers and decision makers about the impact of climate change (Moser and Luers 2008; Tribbia and Moser 2008). 3.7. Consistency over time Topic modeling identified 18 dimensions of environmental planning and protection that the Commission pursued along with exaction and maintenance with public access. One question that immediately arises is: how consistent and stable are the topics over time? Policy consistency is essential for bureaucratic accountability. A bureaucracy Journal of Environmental Planning and Management 1139 Figure 4. Time trends of 18 topics and relative consistency in administrative agendas over the study period. 1140 I. Hui and M. Gorkovenko that has high stability and consistency is more likely to be deemed reliable by stake- holders and the general public. Although bureaucracy is often found to be durable, pol- itical appointments of the top personnel and the composition of the Commission may affect the agency’s policy directions over time. In this section, this article examines the distribution of topics over the two decades and paid particular attention to any potential waxing and waning of topics, as these indicate the general directions of the agency. This article, therefore, considers whether there are topics that were once salient but have become less so over time. It also con- siders whether the Commission changed its priorities and emphasized certain topic(s) in relation to the changing natural climate or political climate. Figure 4 provides answers to these questions. The x-axis shows years (from 1996 to 2016), and the y-axis displays the proportion of paragraphs that belong to a certain topic. For example, for topic 1 (coastal water), the average proportion over time is less than 0.05 (or 5%). A lowess curve was fitted and highlighted in red to denote the overtime trends. At first glance, the majority of these lowess curves are rather flat, which indicates that the majority of these topics seem to have very stable distribution across the years. Three topics, topic 6 and 11 (paragraphs pertaining to procedural processes of permit application) and topic 4 (paragraphs related to discussion of Ballona Lagoon, Venice’s Grand Canal) show marked downward trends, suggesting a decrease in the frequency of discussion over two decades. In contrast, topic 18 (related to construction regulations) shows a marked increase, in part due to the improved economy that generated more construction-related projects and in part due to an increased concern for how these projects could adversely affect the environment. Another topic that shows a noted upward trend is topic 12, which addresses shoreline protective devices. As discussed previously, this topic becomes increasingly important and salient due partly to rising sea levels and a more extreme climate, which can increase the speed of coastal erosion. There is also an uptick of topic 16 (i.e. public information) after the year 2010, which signifies an increase in the commitment of the Commission to public engagement and public dispatch of its know- ledge and mission. 4. Discussion The demand for public access easements as a condition of a permit has stirred a lot of controversy and brought about significant litigation as the practice potentially consti- tutes “taking” of private property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteen Amendments. In Nollan v. California Coastal Commission (1987), the Court found that a public entity may require an uncompensated exaction, such as an easement, as a condition of a development permit, but only in cases where there is a rational connection between the project impact and the condition of approval and only where there is “rough proportionality” between the severity of the project impact on the public interest and the condition being imposed. The Supreme Court ruled that if the state wished to use its power of eminent domain to open up private land for public use, the state must pro- vide just compensation to the property owner(s) and other beachfront property owners for the public use of their land. In another case, SDS Family Trust v. California Coastal Commission (2012), the Commission was sued on the grounds that the ease- ments condition in exchange for approval constitutes an unconstitutional taking of Journal of Environmental Planning and Management 1141 private property. The Court ruled in favor of the homeowner and reaffirmed the importance of private property rights. Despite this setback, empirical data analyzed in this article reveal that opening and maintaining easements, paths, and beach access remains the key focus of the Commission during the permitting process. More importantly, public access acts as a main channel for the Commission to manage other environmental ambitions, such as protecting sensitive habitats, regulating shoreline protective devices, etc. The main goal of this article is not to debate whether the Commission’s actions constitute taking or whether their actions infringe on the rights of homeowners to private property. 10 Rather, it aims to illuminate the black box process without making any subject- ive judgements. Consistent priorities over two decades and occasional fluctuations that address ad hoc, special needs were identified. The Coastal Act laid out the broad regulatory framework, and the Commission defines and refines it through the permitting process. The agency’s administrative role is not just monitoring potential violations. While it has the authority to adjudicate potential violations of public access, this policing or prosecution of violators constitutes a small part of the agency’s routine tasks. The agency’s power comes in the form of developing a proactive program in shaping all- encompassing aspects of public access. Permitting as an administrative tool has been largely ignored in the environmental science literature because permitting actions are often buried underneath deep paper trails. This article demonstrates how webscraping and text mining can be used to dig through large volumes of government texts and correspondence and construct a data- base from those unstructured texts. This technique is transferrable and can be used to study other environmental permitting processes, such as those pertaining to air and water quality, or disposal of hazardous waste. There are several caveats to this study. The number of topics was restricted to fewer than 20 for ease of interpretation. The restriction may overlook some less preva- lent topics, especially those topics that have only arisen in recent years. A survey finds that public attention to adaptation strategies has increased markedly in recent years (Hart et al. 2012). However, the topic modeling technique did not pick up any distinct and stand-alone topics on rising sea level. The topics identified also do not separate “green” environmental adaptation strategies, such as rolling easements beach nourish- ment, dune restoration, marsh and wetlands etc. from “grey” solutions that are well detailed in a recent coastal guideline (Caldwell and Segall 2007; Griggs 2005; Hanak and Moreno 2012; Race and Christie 1982). The topics also did not pick up any dis- cussion of passive solutions such as relocation or retreat. Discussion of these adapta- tion strategies is blended into the 18 topics. A separate analysis of the staff reports is needed to highlight how the Commission responds specifically to rising sea levels and global climate change. Studies have documented how the restriction of development in the coastal zone has increased income and residential inequality (Case and Gale 1981; Dale-Johnson and Yim 1990; Frech and Lafferty 1984; Kahn, Vaughn, and Zasloff 2010; Parsons 1992; Severen and Plantinga 2018). The price increase is driven in part by high demand for coastal properties and low supply of new housing. Low-income households and racial/ethnic minorities are particularly affected (Garcia and Baltodano 2005). The pursuit of environmental justice and fairness manifests, however, primarily through discussion about cheap parking and affordable hotels. There is little discussion about 1142 I. Hui and M. Gorkovenko affordable housing, which has become a more pressing issue as coastal real estate pri- ces soar. One of the topics, topic 2, picks up on the Local Coastal Program (LCP) and Land Use Plan (LUP). It is, however, beyond the scope of this article to elaborate on the intricate political exchanges between the Commission and LCPs over public access. Another article is needed to explore the power dynamics that arise from the desire to “home-rule” versus the need for coherent statewide policies. Nonetheless, in recent years, there has been a surge of calls for “integrated coastal management” (Lowry and Eichenberg 1986; Kenchington and Crawford 1993; Nichols 1999). This article does not address the extent of the intergovernmental efforts that the Commission engages in with other agencies, such as the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, the Coastal Conservancy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. 5. Conclusion The article offers an important policy implication, especially on the permitting process. The California Coastal Commission is one of the rare agencies that archives their per- mit applications and staff reports online for an extensive period of time (in this case, two decades). Many of the permitting agencies in the state do not offer easily access- ible public data. Without data, it is impossible to know what is happening behind the black box. This article shows that more accessible public data are urgently needed, as the general public has the right to know more about how various government agen- cies operate. California regulates shorefront development but has not identified shorefront no- build areas (NOAA 2012). On average, nearly 80% of the applications are approved with conditions (Hui 2017). This figure may seem high and some observ- ers who are unfamiliar with the Commission may form an impression that the Commission is lax over coastal regulation. Such an impression forms merely by looking at the “tip of the iceberg.” A closer examination reveals a substantially dif- ferent story. All of these approved cases come with multiple conditions, not only to open or maintain public access but also to ensure water quality, protect sensitive habitats, limit shoreline protective devices, etc. This article concludes with an ana- logy: if the legal battles were like major thunderstorms that leave dramatic imprints on the landscape, the permitting process is akin to constant waves that gradually carve the coastline and leave no stone untouched. Just like Peter Douglas, the founding and longest serving executive director of the Commission, commented before his retirement: “The coast is never saved. It is always being saved.” Through the permitting process, the Commission quietly exerts its powerful regula- tory influence in managing the California coastline. Notes 1.
