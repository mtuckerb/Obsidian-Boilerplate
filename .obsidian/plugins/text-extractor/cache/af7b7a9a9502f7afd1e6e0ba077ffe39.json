Sude La Salle University This Delphi study surveyed an interdisciplinary panel of diversity expert trainers (N=20) about what white mental health professionals need to understand about whiteness. The panel endorsed 162 items that included what white mental health professionals need to understand about historical and contemporary whiteness within the mental health ﬁelds and larger social systems, self of the therapist work for white therapists, as well as challenges to understanding whiteness in clinical training and practice. More speciﬁcally, the panel provided guidance on the cognitive and emotional transformations necessary for white mental health professionals to address whiteness, as well as the challenges to those transformations. The researchers pro- vide clinical training implications for marriage and family therapists (MFTs) and other clin- icians based on the results. An awareness of the signiﬁcance of race and whiteness has gradually been growing across the mental health professions over the past 30 years. Whiteness can be deﬁned as socialization prac- tices and institutional structures that keep white people in power and privilege a white perspective (DiAngelo, 2018; Helms, 2017). Since its inception, the MFT profession has centralized whiteness. The ﬁeld was founded and developed almost exclusively by white men, and the vast majority of the women that ﬁnally gained recognition in the 1980s and 90s were also white (McGoldrick & Hardy, 2008). Furthermore, traditional family therapy theories tend to frame white, middle-class cultural norms as healthy standards for all families (Akamatsu, 2008). It was not until late in the 20th cen- tury that leadership positions at MFT journals and professional organizations included more peo- ple of color and began to recognize their work through national awards (McGoldrick & Hardy, 2008). Around this same time, a survey of AAMFT members revealed that an astounding 95% identiﬁed as white (Northey, 2002). The feminist and social constructionist movements of the 1980s and early 1900s raised aware- ness about dynamics of power and oppression, particularly those related to gender and the rela- tionship between therapists and clients. However, it was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s that critical analyses of race, white privilege, and white supremacy started making their way into the MFT literature (Boyd-Franklin, 1993; Hardy & Laszloﬀy, 1992; Pinderhughes, 1989). While there was a signiﬁcant increase in the number of journal articles addressing race in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy in the late 1990s (Bailey, Pryce, & Walsh, 2002), a relatively recent study by Seedall, Holtrop, and Parra-Cardona (2014) revealed that only half of the articles dis- cussing race in MFT journals also address power, privilege, and oppression. Literature that does acknowledge power is also much more likely to discuss racial oppression of people of color than it is to focus on the signiﬁcance of whiteness (Helms, 2017).

In academia, critical analyses of racial oppression and challenges to the numerous manifesta- tions of white supremacy have often been framed by Critical Race Theory (CRT) (McDowell & Jeris, 2004). Critical Race Theory emerged within the legal profession in the 1970s and has since been applied to a variety of social sciences and humanities (McDowell & Jeris, 2004). Some of the most thorough analyses of whiteness have been published outside of the mental health professions. Just a few notable examples include Billings’ (2016) history on whiteness and the myth of white supremacy; Wise’s numerous writings on both the personal and sociopolitical ramiﬁcations of whiteness (e.g., Wise, 2011), DiAngelo’s (2018) analysis of “white fragility”, and Irving’s (2014) autobiographical reﬂections on coming to understand one’s race, privilege, and racism as a white person. Within the MFT profession, publications that address both race and power tend to apply and expand upon core assertions of CRT (McDowell & Jeris, 2004). To date, the mental health litera- ture focused on whiteness in the United States (U.S.) tends to assert six consistent themes that echo central tenets of CRT. First, there is no genetic basis for race, but whiteness is a socially con- structed idea that has powerful implications for everyone. Whiteness was created in early colonial America in order to deny rights and privileges to indigenous people and people of African descent (Billings, 2016). Consequently, a white person’s race is linked to historical and institutionalized racism and not limited to one’s personal beliefs, feelings, or intentions (Bartoli, Dently-Edwards, Mar\u0001ıa Garcia, Michael, & Ervin, 2015; Helms, 2017; Sue & Sue, 2016). Second, race plays a highly signiﬁcant role in organizing U.S. society and culture. Race needs to be acknowledged and racial oppression directly and proactively addressed in order to create more just systems in society (McDowell & Jeris, 2004). A color-blind stance on race is not only unachievable, but also fails to address the disparities of power and privilege related to race. There- fore, eﬀorts to assume a color-blind stance risk harming clients (Neville, Award, Brooks, Flores, & Bluemel, 2013). White people are often reluctant to “see color” because they may equate seeing color to discriminating based on color (Hardy & Laszloﬀy, 2008). However, “not seeing color” prevents white people from identifying their own racial biases, unearned privileges, and the impact of institutionalized racism (Neville et al., 2013; Sue & Sue, 2016). Third, white people carry unearned power and privilege in the U.S. Privilege can be deﬁned as the endowment of unearned beneﬁts and advantages based on social location (McIntosh, 2008), and white people are socially privileged on the basis of race (e.g., Bartoli et al., 2015; Combs, 2019; Hardy & Bobes, 2016; Helms, 2017; McGoldrick & Hardy, 2008; Sue & Sue, 2016) even when they are subjugated on the basis or gender, religion, sexual identity, or social class (Hardy & Bobes, 2016; McDowell & Jeris, 2004). One manifestation of white privilege is that white people seldom, if ever, have to think about race (Combs, 2019; McIntosh, 2008; Pinderhughes, 1989; Watson, 2016). Evidence for this assertion in the mental health professions may be found in the relative paucity of scholarly work on the topic of whiteness and racial oppression. Despite all of the mental health implications inherent in centuries of white violence, exploitation, and oppression against people of color, and relentless socialization advancing the myth of white supremacy, there is still relatively little research and theory on the topic of whiteness (McDowell & Jeris, 2004). Fourth, racism and white supremacy are pervasive in U.S. culture, present not only in per- sonal bias and relationships, but also woven throughout the fabric of U.S. social order and institu- tions. Because it is so pervasive, it is often diﬃcult to recognize, particularly by those who beneﬁt from it the most. Therefore, racial justice requires reorganization of social institutions as well as transformation of personal biases (Hardy & Bobes, 2016; McDowell & Jeris, 2004; McGoldrick & Hardy, 2008). Fifth, due to their social position, the voices and perspectives of people of color must be heard and privileged in matters related to race (Hardy & Bobes, 2016; McDowell & Jeris, 2004; McGoldrick & Hardy, 2008). Finally, since race and unconscious bias signiﬁcantly impact thera- peutic relationships, white therapists need to develop awareness about their own white identities and Eurocentric beliefs and expectations (e.g., Akamatsu, 2008; Bartoli et al., 2015; Combs, 2019; Hardy & Bobes, 2016; Hernandez-Wolf & McDowell, 2012; McGoldrick & Hardy, 2008; Shin, Smith, Welch, & Ezeofor, 2016; Sue & Sue, 2016). Understanding whiteness can help white January 2020 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY 63 therapists have cross-cultural conversations that include their own identities instead of only dis- cussing culture in terms of “others” (Akamatsu, 2008). Nearly all of the MFT literature on whiteness is theoretical or based on personal experience, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., Constantine, Juby, & Liang, 2001; Hernandez-Wolf & McDowell, 2012; Hernandez-Wolfe & McDowell, 2013). As systems thinkers, we believe that large systems, such as the MFT ﬁeld, maintain homeostasis by deﬂecting challenges to power. Conse- quently, these theoretical assertions may be dismissed as mere opinion, or lacking relevance for family therapists. To our knowledge, there has yet to be any research that attempts to synthesize theory and establish consensus among experts. This study was designed to address this concern by seeking consensus amongst clinicians with expertise in training on multicultural issues for the fol- lowing question: What do white therapists need to understand about whiteness? METHOD A modiﬁed Delphi method (Stone Fish & Busby, 2005) was employed to answer this question. Delphi research aims to ﬁnd consensus among a panel of experts on a given topic. Several rounds of Likert-type questionnaires are utilized to endorse or reject items until consensus has been achieved (Stone Fish & Busby, 2005). The Researchers Both researchers identify as white, straight, middle class, cis-gender males. They are both mid- career, full-time, associate professors that train MFT and professional counseling students. The second researcher identiﬁes ethnically as Eastern-European Jewish. The researchers were aware that their own social locations could inﬂuence data analysis, and therefore solicited comments and critique from participants in each phase of data collection. Participants The researchers sought participants from across the mental health professions because MFT students are frequently taught and supervised by psychologists, counselors, and clinical social workers in addition to MFTs. The researchers also expanded traditional notions of “expertise” in diversity training beyond scholarship because it is possible to publish a great deal and have little direct involvement with training, or to train a great deal and publish very little. The following inclusion criteria were used to screen participants: (1) possessing a qualifying degree in a mental health discipline, (2) a self-assessment as someone who has advanced knowledge and expertise in training white mental health professionals about what it means to be white, and (3) fulﬁlling at least two of the following categories: (a) a minimum of two publications that address whiteness, diversity, and/or social privilege; (b) a minimum of two professional conference presentations in the past ﬁve years that address whiteness, diversity, and/or social privilege; (c) recruitment by com- munity mental health agencies, universities, training programs, state or national professional orga- nizations, or other similar institutions to educate and train on whiteness, diversity, and/or social privilege; (d) a minimum of ﬁve years of experience training clinicians about whiteness, diversity, and/or social privilege in university settings or clinical supervision. The lead researcher recruited participants through messages posted on the list serves and bul- letin boards of several MFT, counseling, and psychology professional organizations, and by directly soliciting prominent trainers and authors on race, culture, and diversity. In compensation for their time, participants were given the option to have $25 donated to a charitable organization of their choice, or receive a $25 gift card, after completing each of three stages of data collection. Twenty experts agreed to participate, which is a number indicated to be suﬃcient to yield stable results in Delphi research (Jorm, 2015). Six participants identiﬁed primarily as MFTs, eight identiﬁed primarily as psychologists, one identiﬁed as both an MFT and psychologist, three identi- ﬁed as both counselor educators and psychologists, and two identiﬁed as clinical social workers. It is worth noting that four of the participants who did not identify primarily as MFTs frequently train MFTs and/or publish in MFT journals and texts. Fourteen participants identiﬁed as cis-gen- dered female and six identiﬁed as cis-gendered male. Twelve identiﬁed as white (three of which identiﬁed as Jewish), two as Black/African American, two as Chinese American, one as South 64 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY January 2020 Asian, one as Korean American, one as Mexican American, and one as Cherokee-Choctaw. Thir- teen participants had more than ten publications on diversity, and fourteen had at least one publi- cation that speciﬁcally addressed whiteness. In the past ten years, ﬁfteen participants had over ten conference presentations on diversity, and fourteen had over ten presentations that speciﬁcally addressed whiteness. Finally, fourteen participants had been recruited to consult, educate, and/or train on whiteness over ten times, and thirteen participants had at least twenty years of experience training therapists about diversity and whiteness. Procedure and Measures The researchers collected data in three phases. The ﬁrst phase, Delphi Questionnaire I (DQI), used a bottom-up approach to generate data through the following open-ended questions: 1 What do you identify as the core objectives in teaching white mental health professionals about what it means to be white? a What do you believe white mental health professionals need to understand about being white in order to be as eﬀective as possible in their clinical work? b What do you believe white mental health professionals need to embody in their use of self in clinical practice in order to be as eﬀective as possible? c Do you identify any objectives in the training of white mental health professionals that transcend their clinical work? If so, what do you identify as core objectives in training white mental health professionals about being white in other aspects of their professional and personal lives? (i.e., What kinds of action do you expect to see a well-trained white mental health professional taking in their personal lives and professional lives outside the therapeutic relationship?) 2 Do you identify any ways in which being white in the United States impedes upon the devel- opment of essential clinical skills not typically associated directly with race, such as joining with clients or practicing empathic conjecture? 3 In your experience, what has been some of the most common challenges you have encoun- tered in training white mental health professionals to understand and embody all you have discussed in the previous questions? Participants were encouraged to write as much or as little as they wanted. Some submitted bul- let points whereas others wrote longer narratives. The ﬁrst researcher grouped all responses by main ideas and then rephrased main ideas to capture the essence of each unique idea. The second researcher reviewed the generated items for accuracy to the participants’ responses, and both researchers then worked together to rephrase several items. The researchers worded the items in Delphi Questionnaire II (DQII) as closely as possible to participants’ original responses to better reﬂect the intended meaning of the original submissions. A total of 176 items were generated from DQI, and these items were used to generate DQII which was sent to the panel to be rated on a Lik- ert scale from “1” (strongly disagree) to “7” (strongly agree). Participants were also invited to sub- mit new items if they believed an idea they originally submitted was not accurately portrayed in DQII, or if they thought of new items. After the second round of data collection, interpolated medians (IMs) and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated for each item. Items with IMs of 6 or higher and IQRs of 1.5 or lower were considered to be highly endorsed (Stone Fish & Busby, 2005). A total of 146 items (83%) were highly endorsed from this initial survey and 30 items were rejected. Furthermore, ﬁve new items were generated in DQII in response to the invitation to submit new items. Participants were then sent the Delphi Questionnaire III (DQIII), which listed each rejected item from DQII. Participants were shown the IM and IQR for that item, reminded of their rating, and were invited to reconsider their responses and increase or decrease their initial rating if they wished. The IMs and IQRs for the thirty items in DQIII were then recalculated, and seventeen (57%) of these items were endorsed based on revisions to answers in DQIII. Participants were also asked to rate the ﬁve new items on the same (1 to 7) Likert scale in DQIII. These items underwent only one round of rating and were considered to be endorsed if they received IMs of 6 or greater and IQRs of 1.5 or less. Finally, participants were invited to add a brief rationale for their responses in DQIII, and these comments were used to add insight into the results. January 2020 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY 65 RESULTS All participants (N=20) completed DQI, generating 176 items to be rated by participants in DQII. All participants (N=20) also completed DQII, yielding 146 endorsed items (83%) with IMs of 6 or greater and IQRs of 1.5 or less. Five new items were submitted in DQII, and these were included in DQIII for one round of rating. Seventeen participants (85%) completed. Revised responses in DQIII led to 15 of the 30 previously rejected items in DQII being endorsed. Addition- ally one of the ﬁve new items submitted in DQII was endorsed, yielding 162 endorsed items overall (90%). The endorsed items are presented in Tables 1–5, and the items were organized by themes with headings, subheadings, and the original question stems for readability. Whiteness in Social and Professional Contexts Twenty-six items focused on how whiteness shapes experiences within and outside of therapy (see Table 1). Four items related to how white people share common racial experiences, six items spoke to whiteness and its link to a history of oppressing people of color, seven items highlighted how whiteness shapes the mental health professions, and nine items centered on ways that white- ness grants white therapists unearned personal and professional privilege. Self of the Therapist Work for White Therapists The most endorsed items (79) focused on self of the therapist work for white therapists (see Tables 2 and 3). Eleven items addressed the need for personal growth, nineteen items centered on the speciﬁc types of self-awareness that white therapists must develop, and 49 items spoke to actions that white therapists can take as evidence of personal and professional growth. Common Challenges to Understanding Whiteness in Clinical Practice and Training Finally, participants endorsed the second highest number of items (57) related to the common challenges to understanding whiteness in both practice and training (see Tables 4 and 5). Twenty items addressed how being white could negatively aﬀect essential clinical skills, and 37 items addressed challenges to training white professionals about whiteness. DISCUSSION The expert panel endorsed an unusually high percentage of items. High consensus indicates that the results are not bound to professional identity because if MFTs, psychologists, or coun- selors disagreed with an item as a group, it would not have been statistically endorsed. The panel agreed that white people need to learn about historical and contemporary implications of white- ness in society and in the mental health professions, speciﬁcally highlighting the problem of assert- ing whiteness as the “norm” in clinical practice. In addition to increasing knowledge about whiteness, most endorsed items related to self of the therapist work. Similar to what Godfrey, Had- dock, Fisher, and Lund (2006) found in their Delphi study about eﬀective training for working with queer clients, self of the therapist work seems vital for white therapists to understand white- ness. The panel agreed that white therapists need to explore their oppressive tendencies, hold non- judgmental attitudes toward clients of color, and engage clients in conversations about race while acknowledging their own social locations. Participants indicated that while a cognitive understand- ing of whiteness is important, deep personal transformation is essential for building trustworthy relationships with people of color, and an ongoing commitment to continue to learn and grow is foundational to responsible use of privilege and power. However, self of the therapist work is typi- cally focused on therapists’ victimization, not their perpetration (Sude, 2015). For white therapists to increase self-awareness and socially just behavior, self-work will also need to focus on thera- pists’ oppressive tendencies and behaviors. Many items also identify challenges in training white therapists about whiteness. Several of these challenges pertained to white people being ignorant of the signiﬁcance of race, feeling entitled to the comfort of their privilege, and failing to see beneﬁts of exploring their privilege. Participants also noted that white clinicians may see themselves as “good people” with “good intentions” which 66 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY January 2020 Table 1 Whiteness in Social and Professional Contexts Item IM IQR A. White people share common racial experiences that shape their perspectives. White mental health professionals need to understand: Being white is to belong to distinct cultural group in the United States. 6.17 1 The entire existence of white people is rooted in their white cultural orientation. For example, there is no way to avoid being white, being treated as a white person, and/or thinking and making meaning as a white person. 6.17 1 That being white is just one of many cultural ways of being. White mental health professionals need to decentralize whiteness and view white ways of being as one of many; not as “regular,” better, or primary. 6.96 1 Darkness has come to be strongly associated with negative meaning and lightness with positive meaning. This informs ideas about the meaning of skin tone in all cultural groups. 6.36 1 B. Whiteness is inseparably linked to the history of oppressing people of color. White mental health professionals need to understand: White culture is inseparably tied to the history of oppression. 6.73 1 White culture is inseparably tied to institutionalized racism. 6.79 1 The history of oppression in the U.S. and the modern-day ramiﬁcations of this history. 6.91 0 The history of slavery, and its present-day ramiﬁcations. 6.97 0 The history of land being stolen from the Native Americans, and the present- day ramiﬁcations of this history. 6.97 0 Whiteness was socially constructed to privilege and aﬀord rights to certain groups in the U.S. and exclude other groups from these rights and privileges. They need to understand the modern-day ramiﬁcations of this history. 6.97 0 C. The perspectives of white people have shaped the mental health professions. White mental health professionals need to understand: Racism and white supremacy have been woven throughout the mental health profession since its inception. 6.89 0 The DSM, guiding theories of etiology and treatment, and the majority of general principles and practices in the mental health professions, have been created, shaped, studied, and reinforced primarily by middle aged white men. Consequently, the mental health professions automatically center whiteness. Therefore, the knowledge in these professions needs to be evaluated in the context of whom the knowledge was shaped for and by. 6.79 1 Norms in the mental health professions (e.g., for assessments) are based on white norms and values. 6.67 1 The mental health professions have historically brutalized people of color. 6.83 1 Despite good intentions, many theories and interventions in the mental health professions eﬀectively work towards making people of color more like white people. 6.5 1 That each code of ethics is set up from a Eurocentric cosmology. For example, boundaries, limits of relationship, dual relationships, the idea of sharp divide between therapist and client, are all rooted in white ways of understanding how to be in a professional, helping, and/or therapeutic relationship with someone. 6.89 0 Responsible clinical action by white mental health professionals is characterized by an awareness that the DSM is a cultural document that reﬂects the values of western culture. 6.91 0 January 2020 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY 67 hinders their ability to acknowledge potentially hurtful unintended consequences of their actions (Hardy & Bobes, 2016). White trainees may at best remain cognitively engaged in race discussions but emotionally closed, and at worst use their unearned power and privilege to disengage, redirect, or shut down these conversations. Participants also spoke to structural barriers including large class sizes limiting opportunities for deep introspection, a lack of support from one’s colleagues and/or institution in educating about whiteness, as well as educating on whiteness leading to nega- tive teaching reviews. Participant Comments Stone Fish and Busby (2005) note that participants frequently add comments to surveys in order to clarify their responses. This study deliberately elicited comments. Many comments indi- cated items were initially misunderstood, whereas other comments enriched the data. These com- ments generated three main ideas: the importance of intersectionality, language, and hope. Many participants noted that intersectionality must be honored when discussing race. Some participants noted that being Jewish adds complexity to the meaning of being white. These com- ments were aimed at maintaining a perspective that honors the complexity of people and acknowl- edges their subjugation, even as their privilege is challenged. Several comments highlighted the importance of language and critiqued word choice, even if they supported the underlying meaning of an item. For example, some participants stated that “cul- ture” was not the best term to represent white people as a group because “culture” is constructed of many intersecting variables. Even so, these participants supported the notion of white people recog- nizing themselves as part of a distinct racial group with common experiences based on race (Wise, 2011). Phrasing items in absolute terms also elicited some critique. Some participants noted that phrases generalizing “all white people” or the “whole perspective of white people” were problematic because one could not claim to know the experiences or perceptions of “all white people.” Table 1 Continued Item IM IQR D. Whiteness is linked to unearned power and privilege in social and professional contexts. White mental health professionals need to understand: White people carry unearned privilege. 6.91 0 Being white increases one’s access to power, resources, and various institutions. 6.83 0.75 Holding unearned social privilege and power is not contingent upon feeling privileged or powerful. White people hold unearned power and privilege regardless of whether or not they have any awareness of it. 6.94 0 The unearned privilege white people hold gives them a form of unearned power that people of color do not have. 6.91 0 Privilege and oppression are not limited to personal interactions. They are institutionalized. 6.94 0 All behavior makes sense in context. Therefore, the behavior of white people makes sense in the context of unearned privilege. 6.17 1 All behavior makes sense in context. Therefore, the behavior of people of color makes sense in the context of oppression. 6.28 1 White mental health professionals need to understand the theory of intersectionality. (Each person is likely to be privileged in some ways and subjugated in others.) 6.83 0.75 Being racially privileged does not diminish the meaning and signiﬁcance of one’s subjugation in other aspects of their culture (e.g., gender, sexual orientation, social class, religion, etc.), and vice versa. 6.79 1 68 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY January 2020 Table 2 Personal Growth in the Self of the Therapist Item IM IQR A. Need for personal growth. In order to perform eﬀective clinical work, each white mental health professional needs to: Understand that one can be white and still have a positive anti-racist identity. 6.59 1 Understand that realizing they are white and what it means to be white is the starting point to developing a positive anti-racist identity. 6.88 0 Experience a deep personal transformation in relation to one’s own self- awareness, privilege, and power. 6.79 1 Learn to move through the intense uncomfortable feelings that characterize a personal transformation. This must be a transformation toward increased self-awareness of the privilege and power one holds, and the meaning of this privilege and power both to oneself and to others. 6.89 0 Learn to talk about race in meaningful and personal ways. 6.91 0 Build a secure identity that does not depend on a sense of superiority or the denigration of others. 6.89 0 Develop a deep inner knowledge that being privileged does not disqualify one from being a good person. 6.59 1 Internalize a deeply-felt sense of what it means to carry privilege and power as a white person and come to terms with what one will do about it. 6.89 0 Become grounded in self-determined action that is sensitive to the experiences of others but does not depend on grievances from others before taking action (e.g., One does not wait for someone to complain before working to become more just.) 6.79 1 Learn to not depend on praise from people of color for the eﬀorts one makes toward greater self-awareness and just, responsible action. 6.91 0 Take responsibility for how one is experienced by others, regardless of whether or not this is consistent with one’s experience of self. 6.94 0 B. Need for self-awareness. White mental health professionals need to understand: That all therapy is political and there is no such thing as a value-free stance. Therefore, therapists must recognize that they will either take a stance to oppose racism, or a stance to be complicit with, and thereby support racism. 6.94 0 That the ability for people of color to trust white people is negatively impacted whenever white people lack awareness of themselves as racial beings. 6.83 .75 That “white” is not always “right”! 6.94 0 Self-awareness cont. It is important that each white mental health professional: Know that being white will frame how others see them and experience them. 6.83 .75 Understand oneself as a part of white culture in the United States, especially in order to avoid assuming that the experiences and values of others will be similar or identical to one’s own. 6.83 .75 Form a healthy racial and ethnic identity as a white person. 6.5 1 Know their own ethnic history though hearing family stories and creating ecology maps and genograms. 6.79 1 Develop intimate knowledge of how one directly beneﬁts from white privilege. 6.89 0 January 2020 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY 69 Alternatively, absolute assertions seemed to resonate for some participants who commented that due to the systemic nature of whiteness, generalizations for all white people seemed appropriate. Finally, some participants expressed reluctance to endorse items that lacked hope for the pos- sibility of change. For example, in response to the item that states, “The pervasive nature of white supremacy will lead all white mental health professionals to hold problematic biases toward their clients of color,” one participant indicated strong disagreement with the item because it was too negative and did not honor the possibility for change. Interestingly, another participant indicated high agreement because biases are unavoidable and white people will only see the world through their own lenses as white people. However, this participant added a message of hope, saying that with solid training in cultural humility, white people can learn to recognize and process biases to avoid them becoming problematic. In this way, whether participants agreed or disagreed with an item, there was a consistent message about the importance of hope and exercising personal agency. Clinical Training Implications The results of this study may be used to develop academic curriculum, assess learning objec- tives, guide supervision in accordance with MFT core competencies, develop formal assessment measures, as well as enhance self-awareness and personal growth. The results add speciﬁcity for white therapists to learning outcomes that are written for all therapists.

Responsible clinical action by a white mental health professional is characterized by the following: Curiosity about how the story of other connects to one’s own story.

However, the items are not meant to provide educators with a “how to avoid whiteness” checklist. DiAngelo and Sensoy (2010) state that students often want speciﬁc answers about how to be culturally sensitive and avoid racism. They oﬀer some analogies to help students move away from their desire for a “how to” list such as embracing complexity, understanding that all situations are diﬀerent, learning history of race rela- tions, and being able to identify patterns within oneself and in society (DiAngelo & Sensoy, 2010). Similar analogies may help MFT trainees understand the purpose of these results. The results should also not be used to limit dialogue on additional growth areas for white ther- apists that did not make the list of endorsed items. Winston and Piercy (2010) found that diversity training in MFT programs is complex and idiosyncratic because trainers teach about diversity in a variety of ways. It is important to remember that no list of this nature could ever be exhaustive and that the results of this study strongly assert that white therapists remain committed to ongoing learning and growth inside and outside of the training environment. Participants endorsed the importance of ensuring knowledge on topics including the history of racism and oppression (e.g., the social construction of race and whiteness, slavery, and oppres- sion of Native Americans), the modern day mechanisms of privilege, power, and oppression, the historical and current Eurocentric nature of the mental health professions (including the DSM, treatment models, and codes of ethics), and the personal implications holding racial privilege has for relationships (see Table 1). However, the results indicate that for white therapists, knowledge is meaningful only so far as one’s capacity to emotionally understand the ramiﬁcations of racial oppression, feel a sense of personal responsibility to stand against racial oppression, and resist mis- using unearned power in one’s own life. Family therapy and other mental health training programs are challenged to ensure that the development of cognitive knowledge is balanced with attending to the emotional growth and development of the self of the therapist. Training programs may sup- port self of the therapist work focused on whiteness by constructing learning objectives that mea- sure emotional transformation, the development of positive anti-racist white racial identities, personal accountability for racial oppression, and commitment to responsible action. The items in Tables 2 and 3 oﬀer speciﬁc examples of personal growth that trainers may ﬁnd helpful in develop- ing training agendas. In addition to items in Tables 1–3 that may aid trainers, Tables 4 and 5 include numerous challenges to training white professionals about whiteness. Assertions about whiteness are made and received within the pro-racist U.S. society (Hardy & Laszloﬀy, 2008), and when one is accus- tomed to privilege, movement toward equality can feel like oppression. Family therapists under- stand homeostasis well enough to predict that well-established mechanisms that sustain power and dominance are typically eﬀective in obscuring and undermining assertions that aim to uproot the power structures they have evolved to protect. Academic programs may utilize the items in Tables 4 and 5 to anticipate resistance to their training eﬀorts, and to plan to address this Table 3 Continued Item IM IQR Engaging in advocacy that takes a strong stance against any form of violence. Mental health professionals should not accept violence as an aspect of culture. All cultures include violent traditions and it is not reasonable to accept this as normal. On the contrary, it is an enactment of racism, ethnocentrism, classism, and/or sexism to accept that within some cultures violence is acceptable. It never is. Advocacy includes refusing to normalize violence against children, women, queer people, and any other group no matter what cultural context that violence occurs within. 6.83 .75 January 2020 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY 73 Table 4 Common Challenges for White Mental Health Professionals in Therapy Item IM IQR Ways being white may negatively impact essential clinical skills: Asserting white culture as the norm automatically “others” and objectiﬁes people of color. 6.88 0 It will be diﬃcult for white mental health professionals to recognize how their racial power and privilege operate in their relationships with others. 6.36 1 A lack of meaningful connection to one’s own culture puts one in a diﬃcult position to explore and deepen a cultural connection for clients of color. 6.86 1 Internalizing a sense of white as “normal” can generate a bias against clients of color. White mental health professionals are likely to be unaware of their own biases. 6.79 1 Internalized white supremacy and/or a sense of white as normal and right, can give white mental health professionals an unwarranted level of conﬁdence in their own ideas, and in their preferred treatment models as “best practices” for all groups. This lack of openness may prevent a white mental health professional from being empathetically attuned to what would be best for clients. In some cases, it may even lead to further denigration of clients’ preferred cultural ways of being. 6.73 1 Internalized white supremacy and/or a sense of white as normal and right, can make it hard for white mental health professionals to appreciate ways of being in the world that are diﬀerent from white ways of being. 6.79 1 Internalized white supremacy and/or a sense of white as normal and right, can make it hard for white mental health professionals to see resilience in their clients of color. 6.73 1 White mental health professionals are likely to assume others have the same cultural frame as they have. 6.36 1 When white people have internalized white supremacy and a sense of white being normal, it is diﬃcult for them to truly appreciate their clients’ ways of being and join with them. 6.5 1 White mental health professionals may use their belief that all people are the same under their skin to create a false sense of joining. 6.67 1 White privilege breeds a form of certainty and self-assuredness that is counterproductive to joining and the therapy process. 6.59 1 It is impossible for white mental health professionals to have ﬁrst-hand experience with the emotions and experiences of people of color. Therefore, white mental health professionals are at risk of misusing power in a way that recruits clients of color into the therapist’s narrower and more limited frame of reference. 6.14 1 Internalized white supremacy leads white mental health professionals to have a sense of moral superiority in relation to their clients. 6.67 1 A white mental health professional is likely to assume that equal and just relationships are characterized by everyone receiving the same treatment. They are not likely to appreciate or understand that diﬀerent roles and actions are required for people in a privileged position verses those in a subjugated position in order to resist dominant oppressive relationship patterns. 6.23 1 White culture is very linear (focused on arriving at an end state), while other cultural ways of being are more relational or circular (not focused on 6.36 1 74 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY January 2020 resistance proactively. These items may also provide insight into relational diﬃculties in graduate cohorts, supervision groups, professional organizations, and personal relationships. Trainers can also utilize the results to guide their relationships with trainees. White trainers, particularly, can model responsible use of their social and contextual power in their relationships with trainees (Hernandez-Wolf & McDowell, 2012; Hernandez-Wolfe & McDowell, 2013; Sude, 2015; Sude & Gambrel, 2017). White trainers and trainees must also hold each other accountable and resist the urge to burden people of color with the stress they may feel in teaching them about privilege (Akamatsu, 2008). Speciﬁcally, white people need to challenge other white people about overt racism and microaggressions in ways that resist reactivity and instead create possibility for dialogue, bearing in mind that silence and anger only shut down possibilities for change (Lawless, 2008). Educators, supervisors, and other leaders can also heed the messages endorsed by this study that advocate for regular consultation with racially diverse groups of people who are committed to social justice, and to practice constant vigilance and critical thought about how easily one may be recruited back into supporting and reinforcing the status quo of white privilege. The results of this study beg the question of how to go about successfully facilitating growth toward the learning outcomes speciﬁed in Tables 1–3, while navigating challenges listed in Tables 4 and 5. We hope that the results of this study will inspire more publication of eﬀective training strategies. However, this study has strong implications for anyone that endeavors to train white therapists about whiteness. The results suggest that undergoing one’s own education, train- ing, and personal transformation around race and whiteness is a crucial step toward being able to eﬀectively train others. The results also suggest that the work of understanding what it means to be white is never complete. Therefore, it is essential that those who aspire to train others remain engaged in communities that will continue to challenge them and support their own growth. We suspect that eﬀective teachers and trainers on whiteness draw heavily upon their own growth expe- riences to inform their training eﬀorts. The current study may also complement teaching, training, and supervision strategies related to multicultural training from within (e.g., Hardy & Bobes, 2016; Laszloﬀy & Habekost, 2010) and outside (e.g., DiAngelo, 2018; Sue, 2015) of the MFT pro- fession. However, additional research could provide evidence-based guidance on teaching and training white therapists. Table 4 Continued Item IM IQR destination but rather a more ﬂuid way of focusing on process and relationship). Internalization of white supremacy and racial stereotypes can negatively impact a white mental health professional’s ability to have compassion for a client. 6.83 .75 Being white is not an impediment to empathy but being dogmatic and rooted in one’s sense of superiority certainly impedes empathy. 6.73 1 White mental health professionals may have a preoccupation with being perfect, or already having mastered cultural competence. This can get in the way of them being in authentic relationship with their clients. They may fear being challenged for microaggressions so much that they become overly guarded, or defensive about issues related to race, and consequently block authentic connection. 6.5 1 Internalized white supremacy negatively aﬀects all clinical skills in some way or another. 6.5 1 It is diﬃcult for some clients who have valid reasons not to trust the system to join with a white therapist. 6.83 .75 January 2020 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY 75 Table 5 Common Challenges in Training White Mental Health Professionals Item IM IQR The institutionalization of privilege contributes to privilege being hardest to identify by those who hold it. 6.94 0 White mental health professionals, seldom, if ever, are required to think about race in their everyday lives. Race is not a salient issue in their everyday experience. 6.25 1 White students, interns, and professionals frequently assert that race is insigniﬁcant because they are “color blind”. 6.5 1 White mental health professionals often view themselves as “good” white people and become defensive against any idea that would suggest they might embody or enact some form of racism or racial bias. 6.59 1 White students, interns, and professionals are frequently stuck in binary dichotomous thinking. They think of themselves as either good or bad; as privileged or subjugated; as a helper or oppressor; etc. 6.73 1 White mental health professionals tend to be very defensive about topics of race and being white. 6.3 1 The emotional intensity involved with addressing race and whiteness in mental health training settings is out of alignment with white mental health professionals’ daily emotional experiences related to race. 6.73 1 Due to the internalization of white supremacy, white students, interns, and professionals are often accustomed to seeing themselves as right. Therefore, new information that challenges their view of the world is easily dismissed as wrong. In other words, it is often easier for white mental health professionals to dismiss information that challenges them, than it is to challenge their own assumptions. 6.86 1 White students, interns, and professionals tend to stay in a cognitive realm when their colleagues of color are trying to engage them at an emotional level. 6.36 1 The emotional intensity involved with addressing race and whiteness in mental health training settings is out of alignment with what white mental health professionals believe to be necessary in order to become eﬀective clinicians. 6.73 1 White students, interns, and professionals frequently lack the skills to cope with the emotional intensity of working through issues related to race. 6.28 1 Committing oneself to working through issues related to race requires a deeply- felt sense of the importance of the work. It is diﬃcult for white students to feel deeply about something they have never had to think or feel anything about before. 6.79 1 White students, interns, and professionals often use their privilege to avoid working through issues related to race. 6.67 1 White mental health professionals often use their privilege to avoid taking responsibility for the hurt they have caused through misuses and abuses of power and leave people of color to carry the emotional burden of sustaining relationships with them. 6.86 1 White students, interns, and professionals frequently refuse to believe that racism is as bad as portrayed by people of color. 6.86 1 White students, interns, and professionals tend to be more focused on their intentions than on the consequences of their actions. This limits their capacity for empathy and ability to learn from others. 6.79 1 White students, interns, and professionals frequently have diﬃculty shifting out of their subjugated status to their privileged status as a white person. 6.67 1 76 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY January 2020 Table 5 Continued Item IM IQR White students, interns, and professionals are reluctant to give up their elite status, power, and/or social privilege. 6.5 1 White students, interns, and professionals frequently lack a framework for giving up privilege or sacriﬁcing personal comfort for the sake of others. 6.86 1 White mental health professionals tend to lack adequate information on history, especially the intersection of history and race. 6.73 1 White students, interns, and professionals tend to lack adequate knowledge of current events, especially the intersection of current events and race. 6.5 1 White students, interns, and professionals tend to lack adequate knowledge of dynamics of power and privilege in systems and relationships. 6.86 1 White students, interns, and professionals have the privilege and power to decide for themselves whether they will engage in a process of learning more about race and their privilege as white people. They are “free” to not care. There is little to no immediate consequence for not caring or “checking out.” 6.79 1 White students, interns, and professionals have the privilege and power to stop or redirect conversations about race and white privilege in training settings. 6.36 1 White students, interns, and professionals have the privilege and power to determine whether or not they will reveal their true selves in training settings, and frequently opt not to. 6.67 1 Taking a stand on race and white privilege frequently puts white mental health professionals in conﬂict with family, friends, and/or colleagues. 6.23 1 Multicultural classes tend to provide broad overviews of various ethnic groups, rather than invite deep self-introspection. 6.59 1 Large class sizes are not conducive to facilitating deep introspection. 6.59 1 Professionals who teach and train on race and oppression frequently work in relative isolation. Their message is not reinforced by other faculty, supervisors, trainers, etc., and may even be undermined by these colleagues. 6.83 .75 Professionals who teach and train on race and oppression frequently receive negative evaluations by students, interns, and training participants. 6.5 1 White mental health professionals frequently have diﬃculty ﬁnding ways to apply their understanding of race and white privilege to their clinical work. 6.59 1 The mental health professions as a whole tend to treat psychotherapy and social activism as separate, rather than integrated issues. 6.73 1 Larger institutions rarely support ﬂexibility in treatment modalities that would increase the ability to practice with greater racial sensitivity. 6.5 1 White students, interns, and professionals tend to see learning about race as something that can be completed, rather than a life-long process. 6.36 1 White students, interns, and professionals frequently fail to recognize their interconnectedness with people of color. They frequently fail to recognize that their fates are connected to people of color. 6.79 1 White students, interns, and professionals frequently fail to recognize that through collaboration with people of color, there is opportunity for powerful things to be birthed. But, there is no way for this to happen if people of color don’t have space to be authentic. 6.5 1 New item from DQII (only one round of rating): January 2020 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY 77 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Delphi studies tend to contain some inherent limitations (Stone Fish & Busby, 2005). Researchers who conduct Delphi studies must balance the value of completing as many rounds of data collection as possible, with the likelihood of burn out and attrition of their participants. This study was fortunate to have highly committed participants, all of whom completed two rounds of data collection. However, using the comments from DQIII to edit the wording of some items, and then conﬁrm high endorsement would have added value to the data. A second limitation is that only a bottom-up method was used to generate items. Adding a top-down method could have gen- erated even more items for consideration. However, it is likely that the implications of whiteness in the United States are so far reaching that no list would ever be complete. Another limitation of this study is that it was conducted in the United States by U.S.-based researchers, with a mainly U.S.-based panel of experts. The eﬀects of whiteness are certainly rele- vant to U.S.-based clinical work and training, but also extend to many other societies in the world. There may be perspectives missing from these results that a more international panel could have provided, and future research could focus on the eﬀects of whiteness from an international per- spective. Although the results of this study may focus on whiteness in the United States, some results could be applied to other nations and cultures that have a history of white dominance or where having lighter skin tone provides one with more privilege. A ﬁnal strength and limitation of this study also pertains to the participants. While the researchers stand by their decision to use a broad deﬁnition of “expert” for the reasons articulated in the methods section, it can also be said that a similar study that recruits only scholars who have researched and published extensively on the topic of race, or speciﬁcally on whiteness, may yield diﬀerent results. The participants in this study were also limited to those who responded to per- sonal and general solicitation to participate. Therefore, it is possible that there are other perspec- tives that were not included that could be explored in future studies. CONCLUSION This study was designed to ﬁnd consensus amongst a panel of twenty diversity training experts across the mental health professions about what white clinicians need to understand about white- ness. The participants each contributed unique ideas and endorsed an unusually high percentage of items. This suggests that the meaning of whiteness for clinicians is so signiﬁcant, complex, and far reaching, that no list could ever be exhaustive. However, the results of this study may inform assessment of the eﬀectiveness of training and supervision, as well as the ongoing needs of students and supervisees. They may also inspire the development of more formal assessment instruments for whiteness in clinical training and practice. At the very least, the results of this study are worthy of personal reﬂection that may enhance self-awareness and inspire further growth for MFTs and other mental health professionals. Table 5 Continued Item IM IQR Many white students, teachers and therapists who arrived in the United States, or whose ancestors arrived in the United States., after the end of slavery and after the violent displacement of Native peoples in this country, tend to ignore how they themselves beneﬁt from white privilege, including the historical and ongoing advantages that white people have over people of color that result directly from slavery and genocide. 6.65 1 78 JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY January 2020 REFERENCES Akamatsu, N.
