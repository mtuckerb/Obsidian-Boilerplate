A different annual income may be used if there is sufficient reliable evidence to conclude reasonably that the responsible parent earned a greater or lesser actual income. A present disability to pay child support, legal or otherwise, does not bar a determination of past debt due the applicant for any relevant period in which the disability did not exist.

[PL 2021, c. 300, §1 (NEW).] SECTION HISTORY PL 2021, c. 300, §1 (NEW). §2202. Family financial responsibility 1. Purpose. The Legislature finds and declares that child support is a basic legal right of the State's parents and children, that parents have a legal obligation to provide financial support for their children and that child support payments can have a substantial impact on child poverty and state welfare expenditures. It is therefore the Legislature's intent to encourage payment of child support to decrease overall costs to the State's taxpayers while increasing the amount of financial support collected for the State's children. The department is authorized to initiate action under this section against individuals who are not in compliance with an order of support. [PL 2015, c. 296, Pt. C, §21 (AMD); PL 2015, c. 296, Pt. D, §1 (AFF).] 1-A. Written agreement to pay past-due support. An obligor who is presently unable to pay all past-due support may come into compliance with the support order by executing a written payment agreement with the department and by complying with that agreement. A condition of a written payment agreement must be that the obligor pay the current child support when due. Before a written payment agreement is executed, the obligor shall: A. Disclose fully to the department in writing on a form prescribed by the department the obligor's financial circumstances, including income from all sources, assets, liabilities and work history for the past year; and [PL 1997, c. 466, §12 (NEW); PL 1997, c. 466, §28 (AFF).] B. Provide documentation to the department concerning the obligor's financial circumstances, including copies of the most recent state and federal income tax returns, both personal and business, a copy of a recent pay stub representative of current income and copies of other records that show the obligor's income and the present value of assets held by the obligor. [PL 1997, c. 466, §12 (NEW); PL 1997, c. 466, §28 (AFF).] After full disclosure, the department shall determine the obligor's ability to pay past-due support and request the obligor to execute a written payment agreement consistent with the obligor's ability to pay, not to exceed the limits on income withholding in section 2356. [PL 1997, c. 466, §12 (NEW); PL 1997, c. 466, §28 (AFF).] 1-B. Failure to comply with written agreement. Failure to comply with a written payment agreement is grounds for license revocation unless the obligor notifies the department that the obligor is unable to comply with the agreement and provides the department with evidence of the obligor's current financial circumstances to support the claim. The consequences of failing to comply with a written payment agreement and the requirements to avoid license revocation, if the obligor can not comply with the agreement, must be stated in the agreement. If the obligor claims inability to comply with a written payment agreement, the department, upon motion to the District Court, may request the court to determine the obligor's ability to pay past-due support. After notice and an opportunity for hearing, the court may make a finding of money due, render judgment in that amount and order any relief provided under sections 2603 and 2603‑A. For purposes of this subsection, the commissioner may designate employees of the department who are not attorneys to represent the department in District Court. The commissioner shall ensure that appropriate training is provided to all employees designated to represent the department under this subsection.

Public assistance. Debts due the department for public assistance are as follows. A. When a support order has not been established, a payment of public assistance for the benefit of the dependent child creates a debt due the department from the responsible parent for past MRS Title 19-A, Chapter 65. SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT Generated 01.07.2025 Chapter 65. SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT | 35 support. The amount of debt due the department is established by application of the most current child support scale to the responsible parent's income for the time period in which the department was entitled to support payments. In the absence of sufficient reliable information to calculate a responsible parent's past income, it is presumed that the responsible parent had an earning capacity equal to the average weekly wage of a worker within this State as determined by the Department of Labor statistics for the applicable years. A different annual income may be used if there is sufficient reliable evidence to conclude reasonably that the responsible parent earned a greater or lesser actual income. A present disability to pay child support, legal or otherwise, does not bar a determination of past debt due the department for any relevant period in which the disability did not exist. When the department establishes a periodic support payment by administrative decision, the debt is limited to the amount stated in the decision. [PL 1997, c. 466, §16 (AMD); PL 1997, c. 466, §28 (AFF).] B. When a support order has been established, the debt due the department from the responsible parent is the amount established under that order. (1) The debt may not be limited by the amount of public assistance paid for the benefit of the dependent child. Amounts collected by the department in excess of public assistance expended must be distributed pursuant to section 2401. (2) The issuance of a support order does not relieve the responsible parent of any liability for a debt that previously had accrued under paragraph A. [PL 1997, c. 466, §16 (AMD); PL 1997, c. 466, §28 (AFF).] [PL 1997, c. 466, §16 (AMD); PL 1997, c. 466, §28 (AFF).] 2. Failure to pay child or spousal support. For actions initiated pursuant to section 2103, failure to pay support obligations under a support order creates a debt due the applicant. Upon execution of a contract between the department and the applicant, the department may take action to establish, enforce or collect the debt under any appropriate statute, including, but not limited to, remedies contained in this article. The department is subrogated to the rights of the payee as provided in section 2351. [PL 1997, c. 466, §16 (AMD); PL 1997, c. 466, §28 (AFF).] 3. Default judgment. If the responsible parent defaults or otherwise fails to appear, and no support order has been established, the court or administrative hearing officer shall presume that the responsible parent has an earning capacity equal to the average weekly wage of a worker within this State as determined by the Department of Labor statistics for the applicable years. A different annual income than the one specified by this subsection may be used if there is sufficient reliable evidence to conclude reasonably that the responsible parent earned a greater or lesser actual income. [PL 1997, c. 466, §16 (AMD); PL 1997, c. 466, §28 (AFF).] 4. Interstate cooperation. With the execution of an application for nonwelfare services between a state and a resident of that state, the state may request the department to enforce or collect any unpaid support debt belonging to the applicant. Upon written request by a state to the department, the department may attempt to collect either the welfare or nonwelfare debt by action under any appropriate laws, including, but not limited to, remedies established by this article.

Subrogation of support rights. If a support order exists, the department is subrogated to the right of a dependent child or person having custody of the child named in the order to pursue any support action or administrative remedy to secure payment of the debt accrued or accruing under section 2301 and to enforce the order. The department is not required to seek an amendment to the support order to subrogate itself to the rights of the payee. The department is not required to file a motion to intervene or join in any court proceeding to subrogate itself to the rights of the payee and to be treated as a party in any further proceedings regarding the support order. Upon notice to the parties, the department may order an obligor or other payor of child support to redirect payments to the department if payments are owed to the department or another state pursuant to an assignment of support rights or if payments are otherwise required to be made through the department. A person who knowingly violates the department's order commits a civil violation for which the court may adjudge a forfeiture not to exceed $500 plus interest, attorney's fees and costs.
