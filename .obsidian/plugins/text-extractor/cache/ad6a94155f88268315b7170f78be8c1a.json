Dedication This book is dedicated to Betty Ann Preface I published the first edition of The Reluctant Welfare State in 1988. It was the first analysis of the evolution of the American welfare state that placed social welfare policy in the broader context of the nation’s politics, culture, and economics. It discussed the pivotal role of presidents. It brought history up to the present. I asked moral and ethical questions in each chapter, such as whether Americans were sufficiently attentive to the needs and aspirations of members of specific at-risk populations and whether the nation sufficiently protected the rights of at-risk populations. More recently, I’ve criticized the extreme income inequality in the United States that exceeds levels of 20 other industrialized nations. Every social worker should be versed in social welfare history. It grounds us in the strengths and weaknesses of the American welfare state. It showcases the work of policy advocates including many social workers. It gives us insights into specific at-risk populations, not only how they have been marginalized, but how they have empowered themselves. Social welfare history informs us of many programs and policies in the American welfare state so that we can inform our clients about their benefits, opportunities, and rights. It helps us apply ethical principles to guide professional practice by applying standards from the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Social Workers’ Code of Ethics . This book contains many inserts that facilitate these skills by posing specific issues drawn from the history of specific eras. These include one titled Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies and Critical Analysis . It provides a Policy Scoreboard at the ends of most chapters to summarize the major social policies that constitute the American welfare state. It discusses how contemporary Americans can draw on meritorious policies of prior eras while not repeating errors of the past. I’ve used a diversity perspective in this and prior editions. I discuss in this edition how members of many populations have been marginalized in specific historical eras including women; African Americans; Asian Americans; older persons; Native Americans; Latinos; children and adolescents; persons with physical and mental challenges; persons with substance abuse and mental health issues; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons; persons accused of violating laws and residing in, or released from, correctional institutions; immigrants; low-income persons; homeless people; and white blue-collar people. I also discuss how members of these groups have successfully advocated for themselves and with members of other at-risk populations. I discuss political, economic, and cultural constraints that American policy advocates have confronted when they seek policy reforms. I also discuss political, economic, and cultural opportunities that policy advocates encounter. The thousands of policy achievements in local, state, and federal jurisdictions in American history came from tens of thousands of committed policy advocates who helped build a more humane nation. I present a multi-level advocacy model in Chapter 2 that includes micro policy advocacy at the level of individuals, mezzo policy advocacy at the level of communities and agencies, and macro policy advocacy at the level of local, state, and federal governments. I refer to advocacy at these three levels throughout the book. I’ve augmented my discussion of the presidency of Barack Obama in his second term, such as discussing his role in advancing the rights of LGBT people. I discuss in considerable detail the life, candidacy, and presidency of Donald Trump in Chapter 13 . I discuss the ethical challenges that his presidency poses for the social work profession. Many of his policies, as well as his Tweets and speeches, must be viewed through the lens of the Ethical Code of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) that guides the work of members of the social work profession. I discuss ethical issues that are posed by his presidency. I present a framework for engaging these issues in a civil way while not conceding ground when flagrant violations of this Ethical Code take place. I discuss the adverse impact of his policy choices on members of vulnerable populations. I ask whether he betrayed the white blue-collar people who he championed during his presidential campaign. I place historical materials for many of the book’s chapters on the MindTap, where students can delve into specific topics that enrich their understanding of specific eras. They can, for example, read about medieval society to better understand the first colonists that came to the United States. They can read in greater detail about the plight of emancipated slaves in the wake of the Civil War. They can better understand the budget conflicts that took place during the presidency of Barack Obama. I’ve placed these materials in the MindTap for the 9th edition. Instructors can decide which of these materials to assign to students. I discuss how to write policy background papers, letters to the editor, Op-Ed essays, and policy briefs in the 9th edition MindTap. These can be used to develop policies and points of view that can be transmitted to the mass media as assignments at the end of the course. I provide samples of each of them. To facilitate classroom and offsite learning, I’ve included links to innovative, easily accessible Web materials throughout the book. This technology enables students to interact with history through an array of visual, audio, and graphic materials. Students can see homeless people riding trains during the Great Depression, listen to audio interviews with former slaves, view maps and interactive diagrams, listen to presidential debates, and take a virtual tour of a tenement building of the 1880s. They can use these online aids within their classrooms or offsite to develop specific assignments. End-of-chapter materials include: Discussion of unmet, persistent needs and policy issues in specific historical periods and the contemporary period as a means of alerting students to the need for policy advocacy. Analysis of one or more policy failures in specific historical eras to review the need to be alert to ill-considered policies in contemporary society. Analysis of policy innovations in specific historical eras that could be revived or expanded in the contemporary period. A policy scoreboard that identifies specific policies enacted in specific historical eras that have been transmitted to the contemporary era. A master policy scoreboard in Chapter 14 contains an overall list of social policies that social workers often engage in their work as they engage in micro, mezzo, and macro policy advocacy. Ancillaries To help faculty teach social policy history that links to EPAS standards, I have enlarged and revised the Instructor’s Manual Creative Ways to Teach Social Policy History and Link It to Contemporary Society and the Profession . PowerPoint lecture slides and Test Bank questions are provided free of charge to faculty who adopt the the 9th edition. I hope that this edition enhances social workers’ practice in contemporary society. I hope that it motivates many students not just to learn about how the American welfare state has evolved, but to engage in micro, mezzo, and macro policy advocacy to make it more humane in the future. An Invitation to Students Using This T ext You may enter this course with trepidation, believing that it will focus primarily on memorizing distant events and myriad policies with scant relevance to contemporary social work practice. View this course, instead, as an opportunity to interact with events, issues, beliefs, and past policies to improve your practice in contemporary society. Realize that this course takes you right up to the present at the time of the writing of the 9th edition, including the recent presidencies of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and the first 11 months of the presidency of Donald Trump. You can better understand contemporary issues when you view them in the prism of prior periods of time. This course allows you to hone your ethical skills in many ways. You can evaluate whether we even need a welfare state in the first place by examining how the United States fared when it had only a primitive one— without the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or Food Stamps), Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). You can ask how Americans fared during recessions and the Great Depression without unemployment insurance. This course will give you insights, as well, about the life experiences of many vulnerable populations as they contended with various kinds of adversity in the United States prior to the enactment of civil rights legislation and specific social programs. These groups include women; African Americans, Asian Americans; older persons; Native Americans; Latinos; children and adolescents; persons with chronic physical challenges; persons with substance abuse and mental health issues; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons; persons accused of violating laws and residing in, or released from, correctional institutions; immigrants; low- income persons; and white blue-collar people. The course will discuss how members of these groups used empowerment strategies to contend with adversity. This course allows you to grapple with controversial issues that are rampant in contemporary society, as any viewing of FOX News and MSNBC suggests—or with the responses of the Republican and Democratic Parties to many current issues. The roots of these controversies lie deep in the national experience; you will not only learn about their origins, but come to see their prevalence throughout the national experience. You will need to ask yourself whether and how these contending views are relevant to the ethics code of the NASW, which asks social workers to advance social justice and meet important social needs with effective social policies. This course will help you understand the components of the American welfare state as specific programs, policies, and rights were enacted in different eras—and how this process continues today. This course provides you with a Policy Scorecard of these policies and rights that will be indispensible to effective social work practice. Indeed, some of you may consider running for office if this book opens up this possibility for you. This course will also help you augment your social work practice with three kinds of advocacy: micro policy advocacy (commonly called “patient advocacy” or case advocacy), where you help consumers obtain services, rights, and opportunities to which they are entitled; mezzo policy advocacy where you work with communities and agencies to improve services and to address community issues; and macro policy advocacy, where you seek to reform defective policies in local, state, and federal jurisdictions. You will learn about many social work leaders and practitioners who used these interventions in prior eras to help their clients and to make our society a better place. You will develop skills to analyze and develop policies, such as developing a policy advocacy background document that serves as a template for specific reforms in contemporary society. You may also write letters to the editor, Op-Ed essays, and policy briefs, discussed at length in the MindTap. You will find websites that enable you to interact with history through documentaries, interactive diagrams and maps, audio materials, and debates. You will encounter ethical and other questions that will help you grapple with key social issues in the United States. Consider this text to have a policy faculty of thousands of people who helped establish policies and rights to make our society a better place— whether in the past or the present. You will join their ranks as you engage in history to advance your practice in contemporary society.

Part 1. Becoming a Policy Advocate for V ulnerable Populations Introduction The two chapters in Part I provide a gateway to social policy. They define “social policy“ and give many examples of them. They describe the evolution of policies in the United States. They discuss values that shape social policies. They discuss empirical findings that are used to decide whether specific policies are meritorious. They discuss micro policy advocacy, mezzo policy advocacy, and macro policy advocacy as ways social workers engage in policy practice to improve the lives of vulnerable populations. They argue that social welfare history provides skills, perspectives, values, and evidence-based findings that are integral to social workers’ practice. LO 1-1 LO 1-2 LO 1-3 LO 1-4 LO 1-5 LO 1-6 Chapter 1. The Symbiotic and Uneasy Relationship Clients, Social W orkers, and the W elfare State Students will learn in this chapter to: Analyze the evolution of the American welfare state Discuss the need for an American welfare state Understand why vulnerable populations especially need a welfare state Move from our imaginary society to a welfare state Learn the varieties of social policies Explore the purpose of social policies LO 1-7 LO 1-8 LO 1-9 LO 1-10 LO 1-11 LO 1-12 LO 1-13 LO 1-14 LO 1-15 Understand the grouping or clustering of social policies and social problems Identify policies that shape implementation and funding systems Enrich professional practice by placing it in a policy context Understand policy-sensitive practice Trace the gradual evolution of the American welfare state Recognize polarization and gridlock in the last 35 years Develop personal and professional policy identities Seek common ground while honoring the ethical code of the National Association of Social Workers Treat each other with civility Introduction Throughout this nation’s history, those who must bear the brunt of social problems—individuals contending with poverty, discrimination, disease, and other social problems—have depended in considerable measure not only on their personal and familial tenacity and on community supports but also on the policies of public and nonpublic agencies and of federal, state, and local governments. At various times, these policies, singly and in combination, have provided assistance to some, have left others with no assistance, and have worsened the plight of many others. Your journey through America’s social welfare history will help you sharpen many competencies. You will often engage in critical thinking as you ask why vulnerable populations became and remain a central feature of our nation—and why their members often are poorer, sicker, and more poorly educated than other Americans. You will become acutely aware of the social, political, and economic context as it shapes the lives of your clientele positively and negatively. You will become aware of the importance of social policies in the context of your clients, as well as of the agencies and programs where you work. You will become more adept at ethical reasoning as you encounter many situations where you have to take ethical positions with respect to the services you give to specific persons, as well as the ethical merit of specific social policies that they encounter. Your journey through America’s history will help you sharpen your motivation to engage in advocacy for specific clients (micro policy advocacy), to improve agency policies and to help communities improve policies that impact them (mezzo policy advocacy), and to improve government policies (macro policy advocacy) as you see unaddressed social problems. You will see improvements in the context as specific social reforms are enacted in agency, community, and government settings. You will be a better and more complete professional by virtue of your journey through our national history. You will see that members of the same vulnerable populations that you discussed in previous eras continue to confront adversity in the contemporary period. You will engage many ethical issues, such as deciding whether specific policies are meritorious from ethical and evidence-based viewpoints. You will see how vulnerable populations empower themselves. You will see how social activists obtain major policy gains. You read this book during a period when the United States is deeply polarized by ideological divisions, such as between the Democratic and Republican parties. You will need to engage in ethical reasoning to determine which policies and positions to oppose or support. You will consider evidence when making your policy choices. You will learn how to engage in respectful discourse with persons with different views than your own. You will learn how to stand your ground when persons adhere to unethical positions or positions not supported by empirical evidence. If you use this course to achieve these competencies, you will enhance your professional practice conceptually, ethically, and proactively. We will help you by identifying places in this book that discuss the competencies described in the Invitation to Students at the outset of this book. The book provides special inserts for ethical reasoning, critical thinking, and policy practice, as well as websites that allow you to interact with historical and contemporary events. Analyze the Evolution of the American W elfare State Social welfare history is a laboratory where we analyze how Americans have responded to an array of social problems that have included homelessness, poverty, malnutrition, mental and physical illness, disrupted families, orphaned or abused children, violence, income inequality, and discrimination. Americans have fashioned a reluctant welfare state during their history. If they made it more humane through thousands of social reforms and funding enhancements, they provided uncertain or harsh remedies for many residents who experience specific social problems—and particularly for vulnerable populations that we discuss throughout this book. We will ask you at many points in this book to ask whether Americans have advanced the ethical principle of social justice. We will ask you to analyze policies and approaches that might have created humane policies. We will also ask you to analyze whether and why some unmet needs of prior eras remain unaddressed in contemporary society. We will ask you, then, to move beyond a mere bystander role as you engage the evolution of the American welfare state in succeeding chapters. We will ask you to take positions, make arguments, speculate, and identify how we can learn from prior events as we engage in our professional work in contemporary society. LO 1-1 Discuss the Need for an American W elfare State EP 1a EP 3b Imagine American society—or any society—with virtually no social programs, regulations, or civil rights. Let’s make several assumptions about this imaginary society. Assume that its economy is organized in a capitalist fashion where its citizens work in corporate or other business settings—and where people are expected to meet their needs through wages, investments, and savings. Also assume that all who live in this society are expected to purchase their medical care, their housing, their education, and their social services with personal assets. Assume, as well, that no civil rights laws exist to protect specific groups or persons who might be subject to violent acts, discrimination in places of work, or other forms of discrimination in schools, communities, medical services, commerce, or social services. Assume, as well, that persons purchase their own means of transportation (principally cars). Assume that they fund their retirement exclusively from their savings. Also assume that this imaginary society possesses no regulations over businesses, landlords, drug companies, or medical providers. Nor does the society possess police, fire, and public health programs. To say the least, life in such an imaginary society would be uncertain and difficult. Without a police force, persons would be subject to violent acts LO 1-2 and theft. Without fire departments, their homes and businesses would be threatened with destruction, as small fires became conflagrations. Without public health departments that regulate restaurants and markets, sewage disposal, and refuse—as well as inoculate people against diseases— communities would encounter devastating epidemics. If government did not build and maintain roads, bridges, and airports, persons could not travel to work or other destinations. Without public transportation, the nation would experience gridlock on those roads that did exist. Persons lacking the resources to purchase cars would be mostly unable to work if there were no system of public transportation—or get to health facilities, grocery stores, drug stores, and other destinations essential to their well-being. Even if we gave government some minimal police, fire, and public health functions—and allowed it to construct highways, bridges, and other physical amenities—life would still be brutish and uncertain for many people. With no minimum wage requirements, employers could pay employees whatever the market would bear, regardless of the impact on workers. Indeed, it is likely that many workers’ wages would be comparable to wages in developing nations, such as $2.50 per hour. If the United States currently possesses tens of millions of persons who subsist under or near official poverty lines because minimum-wage jobs pay them at such low levels, imagine how many more persons would face this economic crunch if government had no minimum wage requirements. The plight of workers would be made even more harsh, moreover, because government—under our minimalist assumption—would not require or help fund some fringe benefits that many workers currently receive. Many American corporations currently fund their employees’ health insurance partly because they receive huge tax incentives from the federal government to do so—incentives that do not exist in our imaginary society. Nor would employers provide workers’ compensation to fund health care for workers who are injured at work. With no requirements for heeding work safety requirements currently established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or similar agencies in many states, many employers would not purchase machines with safety features, not reduce pollution at the work site, and not curtail workers’ exposure to toxic chemicals—omissions that would endanger the lives of many employees. With no regulations prohibiting the use of child labor, many employers would hire children even for physically taxing work. With no prohibitions on making employees work long hours, some employers would fire workers who were unwilling to work as much as 14 hours per day. Imagine, too, how uncertain persons’ lives would be if no safety net programs existed, such as those that currently provide food, health care, housing, preschool education, income, and other basic needs to tens of millions of Americans. Many Americans cannot currently purchase these necessities because they have lost their work due to downsizing or recessions, are injured or in poor health, are unable to find work, or receive extraordinarily low wages. We can surmise that hordes of people would have to resort to begging or theft to survive in our imaginary society if they encountered a recession as deep as the one that existed from 2007 to 2009 and beyond—or even during periods of economic growth when tens of millions of Americans use SNAP (food stamps), free or subsidized school lunches, Medicare and Medicaid, and rent subsidies. Residents of our imaginary society would be harmed, as well, if Americans lacked policies to address global issues. Absent any policies that dealt with such issues as immigration, the spread of diseases across national boundaries, global environmental issues such as carbon dioxide emissions that threaten global warming, and efforts to address an array of social problems in developing nations, residents would experience many uncertainties. They might be unprotected against a flu epidemic such as the one that killed 20 million to 50 million persons worldwide in 1918. Lacking protections, immigrants might be attacked by xenophobic citizens without any legal protections. American workers would find their work safety and wages deteriorating if international trade treaties allowed American corporations to victimize workers in the developing nations where they had moved their operations. Such places as Florida, the Gulf Coast, New York City, and portions of San Francisco might be inundated by the ocean if international treaties failed to avert or slow global warming stemming from the emission of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. Nor would many persons belonging to vulnerable populations fare well. Individuals harboring prejudice could prey on persons of color without any restrictions, whether by denying them jobs and promotions, forcing them to attend segregated schools, not allowing them to live in their neighborhoods, denying them access to public places like restaurants, or (even) physically harming or killing them, such as when tens of thousands of African Americans were lynched in the South prior to the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965. Persons with physical and mental challenges would receive few of the work, housing, and transportation accommodations currently required by federal legislation. With no civil rights legislation to protect them, women would suffer discrimination at work with no fear of legal repercussions by employers or fellow employees—and would lack legal protections against sexual harassment at work, in their homes, and in schools. Life would be difficult, too, for tens of millions of retirees. Roughly half of persons who reach age 65 do not currently own their own homes and lack significant savings—and a significant percentage of them are significantly in debt. With no government-funded pensions and no subsidized health programs, many of them would be in desperate straits when confronted with poor health or chronic health conditions. Unless physicians and hospitals agreed to serve them on a charitable basis, they would lack health care. They would be unable to purchase medications. Unable to afford rent, many of them would be forced to live on the streets unless relatives or charities came to their assistance. Those middle- and upper-income persons who believe that they could live easily in our imaginary society should reconsider just how much they currently benefit from an array of social policies. They currently benefit from the nation’s largest housing subsidy program that allows them to deduct much of their mortgage payments from their income when calculating their federal and state taxes. (These tax benefits are larger in their cumulative size than all of the nation’s welfare programs.) We have already discussed how the federal government underwrites their medical insurance payments by giving their employers tax breaks for funding them. Private entrepreneurs are enriched by their ability to write a significant share of their business expenses against their income when computing their federal and state taxes. Many American social policies favor affluent Americans. They greatly increase their resources, for example, as they pay relatively low federal taxes as compared to counterparts in Europe and Canada, even if they often think they pay exorbitant taxes. If upper marginal tax rates are around 39% for affluent Americans, they often exceed 50% for affluent Europeans. Affluent Americans pay only a 15% tax on capital gains when they sell stocks, bonds, houses, property, or other investments at a profit—and often pay little or no taxes on dividends or payments they receive from many state-issued bonds that pay tax-exempt interest. Many tax loopholes greatly assist affluent Americans to the point that Warren Buffett, worth tens of billions of dollars, argues that his secretary pays higher tax rates than himself. Americans have two welfare states: one for relatively poor persons, and another for relatively affluent persons. Other tax loopholes greatly assist affluent persons. Affluent Americans benefit in many other ways from the American welfare state. Many of them would contract diseases if the nation lacked public health programs that inoculate its residents and screen for such diseases as tuberculosis. Without education, job-training, and social service programs, they could not employ productive people for their businesses. Without a publicly subsidized transportation system, they could not run businesses that receive and ship raw materials and products. Affluent people use the nation’s social programs when members of their families become disabled, sick, or unemployed. They are entitled to Social Security benefits and pensions as well as Medicare. They write off mortgages on mansions and vacation homes. Understand why V ulnerable Populations Especially Need a W elfare State EP 1a EP 2a EP 3a EP 3b EP 5a If our imaginary society truly existed, and those persons who lived in it suffered uncertainty and ill effects, the members of vulnerable populations would be placed in particular jeopardy by the absence of government programs, regulations, and civil rights, as our discussion of seniors and low- income persons already suggests. Such forms of prejudice as racism, homophobia, gender-based discrimination, ageism, classism, hostility to immigrants, xenophobia, and dislike of persons with mental and physical issues were and are deeply rooted in American society. Prejudices often profoundly shape the political process and the kinds of policies that affect vulnerable populations. Because low-income persons vote in relatively small numbers and many Americans do not understand or care about their economic issues, the Congress and state legislatures often enact policies that are relatively harsh toward them or that siphon scarce resources toward more affluent persons and interests. Because children LO 1-3 cannot vote and often lack substantial support from the broader population, legislatures often give their programs relatively scant funding—while funding at far higher levels programs for elderly populations that are more powerful politically. Even older men and women encounter remarkably harsh policies, such as ones that require them to “spend down” their assets when they experience catastrophic illnesses until they become sufficiently poor to qualify for Medicaid. V ulnerable populations need a welfare state, moreover, because they are more likely to experience poverty, economic uncertainty, and victimization. Poverty exists disproportionately, for example, among single women with children, persons of color, and persons with mental and physical challenges. If no government safety net programs existed, many members of these groups would not be able to meet their survival needs, such as food, medical care, income, and housing. V ulnerable populations are also more likely than other groups to be victimized by landlords, employers, merchants, middle-income and affluent communities, credit card companies, and schools. Absent protections and rights, immigrants to the United States would find themselves in particular jeopardy. They might be denied access even to emergency medical services, to schools, to work safety protections, and to a minimum wage—even as they filled jobs that most citizens did not want and even as they paid payroll and other taxes. Our discussion should not suggest that members of vulnerable populations need or seek handouts. Indeed, their members have often displayed remarkable resilience and ingenuity in addressing their own needs during specific historical eras and in contemporary society. As we discuss at many points in this book, they have developed their own self-help strategies, community institutions like churches and businesses, and power resources in local communities. They have also advocated for policy reforms, such as civil rights legislation and enhanced funding for social programs. They have fought for improvements in their communities, such as enacting zoning requirements that decrease the number of bars and liquor stores in low- income areas, funding affordable housing, promoting good-quality schools, funding job-training programs, and promoting the development of healthy neighborhoods with recreation facilities, full-service grocery stores, and safe streets. Imagine, too, how the work of professional social workers would be impeded if virtually no social policies had existed during the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009 or during Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. After reading Insert 1.1 , discuss the following questions: To what extent can social workers provide effective interventions to economically distressed families if they cannot refer them to the myriad social programs of the American welfare state? To what extent is micro policy advocacy—in which social workers “go to bat” for clients and link them to those services, benefits, and rights provided them by the welfare state—an important professional role? (Drawing on your personal knowledge, identify how you could provide micro policy advocacy to this family now, when numerous policies and programs exist that could help them.) Insert 1.1. Critical Analysis: Critically Reﬂecting on Your Professional Role Assume that you work with a family whose finances were devastated by the economic recession of 2007 to 2009 and beyond. Or imagine that you are working with victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017, whether in Texas or Florida. In this imaginary situation, there is virtually no welfare state in the United States. Also assume that you are working with a family that has two preschool-aged children. Assume that both parents have lost their jobs and have had their house foreclosed on because they cannot make their mortgage payments—or lost their homes in Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. Also assume that the parents are unable to purchase sufficient food for themselves and their two children. Lacking health insurance, the mother is unable to afford medications for her diabetic condition. Assume the family’s car has been repossessed because they can no longer make payments on the loan they took out to purchase the car in the Great Recession or that their cars were destroyed by surging water in one of the three hurricanes—so they find it difficult to travel to job interviews or even to go to supermarkets. Y ou will learn about the challenges that confront 18 vulnerable populations as you move through the history of the American welfare state. These include African American, Latino/a, Asian American, and Native American populations. They include women, older people, and people with physical, mental, and substance-abuse disabilities. They include children. They include the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) population, criminal offenders, homeless people, and juvenile delinquents. They include some Jewish Americans, some Asian Americans, and some white Americans. They include low-income persons. They include immigrants. They include veterans. I discuss challenges that these various groups have confronted in prior and present periods, as well as the enactment of some policies that have hindered or helped them. Move from Our Imaginary Society to a W elfare State Let’s define a welfare state as an organized and societal response to the needs and rights of residents —something that our imaginary society does not possess. A vast array of social policies form the foundation of welfare states that we can classify by their form, purpose , and the way they have been grouped or clustered in welfare states. We can also identify policies that shape implementing and funding systems that allow specific policies to be actualized. LO 1-4 Learn the V arieties of Social Policies In its broadest sense, social policy represents a collective strategy to address social problems. This collective strategy is fashioned by government laws, rules, regulations, budgets, and personnel—that is, enactments that affect or bind the actions of residents, government officials, professionals, and the staff of social agencies. Let’s consider these aspects of social policy in more detail. Constitutions define the social policy powers of government at the federal and state levels. As we have already noted, the failure of the federal Constitution to enumerate social welfare functions for the federal government was interpreted to mean that such functions should be left to state and local governments and to the private sector. As a result, the development of social welfare policies in this country was seriously delayed. States, too, possess constitutions that establish important duties of state governments, as well as how they govern themselves. Some social welfare strategies involve public policies , laws enacted in local, state, or federal legislatures. These include the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Social Security Act of 1935, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991, and the Medicaid Program created by adding Title XIX to the Social Security Act in 1965. These public policies can be modified or terminated, as illustrated by the effort by President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans to terminate the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). Court decisions play important roles in American social policy. By overruling, upholding, and interpreting the federal and state constitutions, statutes of legislatures, ordinances of local government, and practices of public agencies such as mental health, police, and welfare departments, courts establish policies that significantly influence the American response LO 1-5 to social needs. For example, in the 1980s, the courts required the Reagan administration to award disability benefits to many persons with mental disabilities even though many administration officials opposed this policy. Federal circuit courts declared two proposals developed by President Donald John Trump to curtail immigration from some mostly Muslim nations to be unconstitutional in 2017. Budget and spending programs are also an expression of policy, as society cannot respond adequately to social problems if resources are not allocated to the relevant programs and institutions. For example, Americans chose not to expend a major share of the gross national product (GNP) on social programs before the 1930s but greatly increased levels of spending during the Great Depression and in succeeding decades. Despite the large increases in spending on social programs in the 1960s, the 1970s, and even the 1980s, the nation chose to devote a significant portion of its federal budget to military spending during the Cold War and to make successive tax cuts— policies that greatly reduced the resources available for social programs. President Trump and Congressional Republicans developed budget policies that made deep cuts in many social programs and tax policies that mostly enriched affluent Americans and corporations as we discuss in Chapter 13 . International treaties, as well as policies of the United Nations , govern an array of economic, social, migration, environmental, and national security issues in an era of globalization. Stated or implied objectives also constitute a form of policy. For example, the preambles and titles of social legislation suggest broad purposes or goals. As its title suggests, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity and Reconciliation Act that Bill Clinton signed in August 1996 emphasized rules and procedures for getting welfare recipients off welfare rolls rather than providing them with training, education, or services. Rules, procedures, and regulations define the way in which policies are to be implemented. Legislation often prescribes, for example, the rules or procedures to be used by agency staff in determining applicants’ eligibility for specific programs such as Medicaid. Courts often prescribe procedures that the staff of social agencies must use to safeguard the rights of clients, patients, and consumers, such as preserving the confidentiality of their records or safeguarding the rights of persons before they can be involuntarily committed to mental institutions. Government agencies issue administrative regulations to guide the implementation of policies, such as requiring agencies to provide translation services to people who do not speak English. These regulations have the force of law. Compared with written or official policies, informal policies are subjective views of persons and groups that influence whether and how they implement specific policies. Assume, for example, that the government required nursing homes to provide recreational services to their residents (official policy). Also assume that the staff of a particular nursing home did not want to provide these services (informal policy). The subjective views of the staff would need to be changed to implement the formal policy, whether by giving them training, convincing management to enforce the official policy, or by using coercive strategies like withdrawing public funds from nursing homes that failed to provide recreational services. Explore the Purpose of Social Policies EP 1b EP 3a EP 3b EP 5a EP 5b Regardless of their specific form, social policies can be classified by their ultimate purpose in the welfare state as they address specific social problems or issues, such as: Needs-meeting policies , including programs that give persons food, medical care, housing, and income (which would include some contemporary programs such as the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program [SNAP], Medicare, Medicaid, rent subsidies and public housing, Supplementary Security Income [SSI], and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families [TANF]) Regulations that restrict the ability of landlords, employers, corporations, manufacturers of drugs and food, providers of health and mental health services, and the police to victimize consumers or persons with whom they deal LO 1-6 Opportunity-enhancing policies such as schools, preschools, job- training and job-finding programs, subsidies to small businesses, tax incentives to help persons start businesses or to encourage corporations to train low-income persons, and programs that help persons become American citizens Policies that establish and fund social and medical services to help persons with a range of personal and familial problems as well as an array of medical problems Education policies that provide preschool, primary and secondary, and postsecondary educational programs Civil rights policies that specify the rights of specific groups, such as women, men, persons of color, persons of every national origin, persons with mental and physical challenges, older persons, children and youth, persons of all faiths, and persons with specific sexual orientations Referral and linkage policies that establish case-management, ombudsman, and outreach programs Equality-enhancing policies that target resources to low-income populations (such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and many means- tested programs) and that tax resources away from affluent persons, such as the progressive federal income tax Asset accumulation policies that help consumers develop savings accounts and real estate as well as develop small businesses Infrastructure development policies that promote the development of transportation systems and parks Economic development policies that provide tax incentives and loans to citizens and businesses to stimulate job training for employees and that facilitate the economic development of low-income areas Protective policies that help persons who are subject to abuse or violent actions of others, such as protective services for children and policies that protect women from physical assualt—as well as policies that promote safe neighborhoods Preventive policies that aim to avert the emergence of specific social problems such as public health policies that decrease levels of bacteria in food and water Disaster relief policies that shape the immediate response to natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina in 2005 in New Orleans; Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey and New York State in 2012, and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria in Texas, the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean islands in 2017. To these domestic policies, we need to add policies that are germane to globalization. With the increasing movement of capital, labor, pollution, and diseases across national boundaries, Americans have increasingly had to cope with an array of global issues—even if they have developed humane policies only reluctantly in recent decades. They have had to develop: Immigration policies to determine how to deal with legal and social issues associated with persons who cross international boundaries with or without specific kinds of visas or other legal documents Policies shaping work conditions (wages, work safety, child labor, and hours of work) of workers in the nations with whom the United States conducts trade under various trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and treaties of the World Trade Organization (WTO) American policies germane to festering health, poverty, economic, and environmental conditions in developing nations , such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic in many African, Asian, and Eastern European nations American policies that shape global environmental problems that powerfully influence the health and well-being of citizens in all nations National and international security policies that not only provide safety to nations around the globe from invasions and terrorism, but that also discourage any nation, including the United States, from operating outside the orbit of the Geneva Agreements, the United Nations, and international law Understand the Grouping or Clustering of Social Policies and Social Problems Social policies, as well as some social problems, are grouped or clustered in specific policy sectors , such as mental health, health, child and family, safety net, welfare, education, gerontology, immigration, criminal justice, and civil rights. This grouping or clustering partly reflects historical traditions where specific policies were clustered in specialized programs and agencies that addressed specific social problems. “Problems of the mind” came to be addressed by specific organizations, such as “asylums” (later called hospitals for mentally ill persons), family counseling agencies, community health centers, and private counseling services with social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Problems of neglected or abused children were clustered in public child welfare agencies, child guidance clinics, and family counseling clinics. “Welfare” agencies came to subsume public cash assistance to an array of “needy persons” including single mothers and blind, disabled, and elderly persons. Heath problems came to be subsumed in hospitals and clinics—and to be funded by private health insurance and public programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). This grouping or clustering of social policies into policy sectors has both positive and negative consequences. If persons possessed problems of the mind, for example, they knew where to go to get counseling and related services. If persons believed that a child was abused or neglected, they knew that child welfare agencies addressed such problems. In similar fashion, persons with medical, housing, education, and familial problems knew where to go to get assistance with them. Persons who believed their civil rights had been infringed knew to approach specific enforcement agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). LO 1-7 Grouping or clustering also facilitated the training of professionals and staff who came to be employed by organizations in these policy sectors. Counselors, teachers, physicians, nurses, and child welfare workers received training geared toward the social problems commonly addressed by specific policy sectors. Yet grouping and clustering also had negative consequences. It creates relatively independent fiefdoms, or silos, in the American welfare state. Persons with mental health problems, for example, often need counseling, but they may also need help with specific medical and substance abuse problems. If their mental distress is caused or exacerbated by their economic condition or homelessness, they may need job training, employment, and housing assistance. Yet they often find it difficult to access these various services due to their separation from mental health services in separate bureaucracies or agencies. Many social problems, moreover, defy simple remedies by a single set of agencies. Many homeless persons need, for example, a combination of housing, mental health, substance abuse, welfare, medical, and economic assistance. Many persons who graduate from foster care at age 18 require a similar combination of services and benefits. Professionals and staff who are trained only to relate to consumers or clients from highly specialized vantage points are often incapable of orchestrating services and benefits that speak to their broader needs (see Insert 1.2 ). Insert 1.2. Critical Analysis: The Problem of Silos Let’s return to the family that we discussed in Insert 1.1 that was economically devastated by the deep recession from 2007 to 2009 or Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. What additional social problems might members of this family develop as they descend into extreme poverty, with both parents having lost their jobs, their home, and their car? Might the problem of “silos” make it difficult for social workers to address the family’s needs if they work for a social agency that specializes in only a specific problem or issue? Can you think about these questions by referencing someone you know or have seen in your field placement?Identify Policies that Shape Implementation and Funding Systems No matter their form or purpose—or how they are clustered or grouped— specific social policies require two additional features if they are to be actualized rather than being only policies on paper. These are: Policies that mandate and shape implementing systems to allow these various policies to be placed into action so that consumers can use and benefit from them—such as administrative regulations, policies that allow public agencies to contract with private agencies to deliver services, and civil service and other regulations shaping staffing patterns of public and private agencies Policies that establish how funds are raised and distributed to fund social programs, whether from budgets of local, state, or federal governments; federal and state income taxes; property taxes; earmarked taxes such as the payroll tax used to fund Social Security and a portion of Medicare; tax concessions that subsidize some of the costs of specific services or benefits; or consumer fees. LO 1-8 Enrich Professional Practice by Placing It in a Policy Context Social workers are required by their code of ethics to place the needs of their clients first. They are morally obligated to select interventions, diagnostic tests, and treatments that will most enhance their clients’ well- being. When credible research suggests that specific interventions are likely to help specific clients, professionals should use them—while relying on their best professional judgments when such research does not exist. The evolution of the American welfare state strongly suggests, however, that clients’ well-being extends beyond the scope of specific encounters with professionals. Specific bouts of therapy would not, for example, have addressed the full range of needs and wishes of persons cast into poorhouses because they were unemployed in the 19th century, whether due to recessions, physical or mental challenges, or discrimination. Nor would they have addressed the major needs of freed slaves, low-wage industrial workers in the 1880s, unemployed persons in the Great Depression, or African American soldiers returning from World War II to Jim Crow laws and segregation in the American South or to growing segregated communities in Northern American cities. Subjected to sexism in workplaces, schools, homes, and professions, women often need more than counseling to address a full range of issues confronting them. Social welfare history forces us to view human behavior in its broader societal and policy context. It leads us to examine societal factors and forces that, singly and in tandem, limit life prospects for some vulnerable populations. It places human beings in their broader context rather than viewing them as separated from it. It leads us to consider policy-sensitive and policy-related practice, as well as empowerment strategies , that move beyond traditional therapeutic, medical, and legal services to give services LO 1-9 that address a full range of the needs of their clients. It leads us to consider policy-advocacy practice when we believe that existing social policies contribute to their clients’ problems or needs—such as micro policy advocacy, mezzo policy advocacy, and macro policy advocacy. Understand Policy-Sensitive Practice All professionals should engage in their work with consumers with the knowledge that their well-being often extends beyond the scope of the traditional services that they provide. A woman who cannot afford an adequate diet for her children due to day care, transportation, and housing costs will often find her health—or the health of members of her family—to be compromised by this reality— no matter how skillfully her physician, attorney, or social workers help her with the traditional services they often provide. The physician, lawyer, or social worker who fails to refer her to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or the food stamps program)—or to other income-enhancing programs like the Women’s, Infant, and Children’s Program (WIC) or to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)—is not sufficiently improving her well-being by neglecting an array of her needs and the needs of her family members. Our analysis of the evolution of the American welfare state gives abundant examples of the impact of economic, housing, civil rights, environmental, and other external forces on the lives of members of vulnerable populations. Through most of the nations’ history, a range of public safety net programs did not even exist, so persons and families were thrown back on their own resources, as well as the resources of their networks and communities. Imagine hardships experienced by settlers on the frontier who had to devote several years to getting their first crops planted and harvested when virtually no safety net programs existed—or immigrants who arrived with no resources; the victims of recessions and depressions; and women who were widowed with no inheritance or employment prospects under the same circumstances. It was precisely because voters and public officials recognized that persons’ well-being was compromised by the absence of a minimum threshold of resources and services that the American welfare state gradually evolved from a primitive toward a more advanced one— even if this evolution required more than 200 years even to yield the very LO 1-10 imperfect American welfare state of contemporary society. Social welfare history sensitizes us to the environments of persons and populations as they were buffeted by adverse economic and social conditions in many preceding eras, as well as in the contemporary period. Policy-sensitive practice also requires professionals to recognize the importance of rights and entitlements to people. Through most of American history, they hardly existed for members of the 18 vulnerable populations identified in this book. Imagine the impact on members of these groups when they were subject to random and systematic racism not just from neighbors and other residents, but even from government officials, social agencies, churches, public transportation, hotels, restaurants, bankers, real estate agents, and landlords—with virtually no protections codified in law and virtually no government bodies charged with monitoring and protecting their rights. Persons subject to unfair treatment suffer not just short-term problems such as restrictions on their employment, resources, recreation, ability to vote or hold public office, and movement around the countryside, but also assaults to their mental and physical health, not to mention their sense of personhood. Many civil rights laws and regulations developed only relatively recently in American history, whether the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, immigration legislation in 1966, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 that guaranteed marriage equality for same- sex couples. Professionals need to be aware of the importance of rights and entitlements as they serve specific persons to see if they are denied specific rights and entitlements. They also need to know that many members of vulnerable populations are still denied basic rights or find their rights to not be monitored or enforced—or are unaware that they even possess specific rights or entitlements under existing laws and regulations. By the same token, professionals in contemporary society should be sensitized by their knowledge of the evolution of the American welfare state to specific gaps and omissions in its current social policies. As we learn from studying the evolution of the American welfare state, social policies evolve through a political process that often brings unfortunate compromises that impede their fairness or effectiveness. Professionals who work in relatively conservative states should recognize that many programs devolved from the federal government to their states will be more poorly funded than ones in more liberal states—and will be administered with more punitive guidelines. Means-tested programs often possess unacceptably low eligibility levels—and their benefits are often inadequate. The culture of poor laws and poorhouses still exists in the United States as reflected by punitive policies of welfare legislation enacted in 1996 and mostly still in force. Funding levels for many programs can be suddenly cut or entire programs eliminated. Certain kinds of persons are not allowed to get benefits under some programs, such as (until recently) single parents for the EITC Program (see Insert 1.3 ). The United States possesses the highest level of economic inequality among 21 industrialized nations, partly due to social policies that are less generous than these other nations. Insert 1.3. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: The Case of Persons Imprisoned for Use of Drugs The United States has had relatively harsh policies toward specific vulnerable populations for long periods of time. Take, for example, policies toward persons placed in prison for violating the nation’s drug laws. Go online to find the number of persons currently in prison for drug-related offenses—and specifically for use or selling of marijuana. See if you can locate a rough estimate of the cost to society of imprisoning persons who use or sell marijuana other than for medicinal reasons that is allowed by some states. Is counseling and other services readily available for persons incarcerated for this offense, as well as job training and employment services? Can you find evidence that persons of color are disproportionately imprisoned for drug-related offenses and, if so, why? Has this harsh orientation toward persons who commit drug offenses long existed in the United States? In light of our research, do you think American drug policy is fair, or does it discriminate against persons of color? Americans do possess a reluctant welfare state that often creates or even exacerbates problems for residents. Awareness of the reluctance of the American welfare state helps professionals better understand their clients’ predicaments—and requires them to be creative in helping clients deal with the imperfect social policies they confront. Social welfare history teaches us not only that many policies are deficient, but also that they are poorly monitored or implemented. The U.S. Department of Labor failed to monitor the extent to which corporations actually paid immigrant laborers that repaired New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sometimes fails to monitor or enforce job discrimination against women, such as when they become pregnant or give birth. Child welfare programs in some jurisdictions were so poorly implemented in the 1980s to the present period that federal courts ordered that many of them be placed under state management or other agencies. Trace the Gradual Evolution of the American Welfare State This book chronicles and analyzes the emergence and evolution of the American welfare state. Only gradually did the elements of the contemporary American welfare state emerge over this time span. While many background cultural, economic, demographic, and other factors played a part, policy advocates were the key precipitators of the rise and development of the American welfare state. Singly and in tandem in specific time periods, they mobilized support and resources for additions to the American welfare state—often facing considerable opposition from other persons, groups, and interests. They also fought against efforts to downsize or eliminate specific policies in specific historical eras and in contemporary society. The history of American social policy can be divided into a series of policy eras—specific periods that have an identifiable policy direction, substance, and intensity. The policy direction of an era describes the general nature of the policies enacted then. In relatively conservative periods, the emphasis of policy makers was and is on maintaining the status quo, eliminating reforms established in a preceding era, or making major amendments to prior enactments. As we discuss in succeeding chapters, many conservatives favor devolution (ceding federal policy roles to states and local governments) or privatization (ceding public policy roles to for-profit corporations and private markets). * In relatively liberal eras, policy makers enact major new reforms that redistribute services and resources or that increase the role of government. The substance of policy refers to the general strategies favored by decision makers in a specific era. For example, between roughly 1905 and 1917, legislators enacted regulatory reforms that established minimum public LO 1-11 health, housing, and work safety standards. Decision makers in the 1930s placed far more emphasis on legislation that redistributed resources and jobs to unemployed and poor persons. Reformers in the 1960s emphasized provision of social and medical services, as well as the establishment of civil rights laws. Reformers in the early 1970s emphasized provision of cash benefits to people rather than social services, which received more attention in the 1960s. Democrats sought in the presidency of Barack Obama to rebuild some powers of the federal government by increasing government regulation of banks, oil companies, and the health care system. Republicans sought during the early part of the presidency of Donald Trump to repeal the Affordable Care Act and climate-control regulations. This book provides “Policy Scorecards” at the end of each chapter that describe the policies developed in specific eras—and provides a master Policy Scorecard in Chapter 14 that summarizes these policies. The intensity of reform describes the rate of policy activity. Relatively few policy changes occurred in the 1920s and 1950s, for example, but many changes were initiated in the 1930s, 1960s, and 1980s. American social welfare policy has evolved in a series of phases (see Table 1.1 ) that are described by Parts 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 of this book. Part 2 discusses social policy in a developing nation from the early 17th century to 1800. It discusses how settlers established small settlements along the Atlantic seaboard, declared independence from England, drafted and enacted a Constitution, and elected its first two presidents (George Washington and John Adams). The federal government had little resources or power as the colonists mostly relied on local government for its few social policies. The U.S. Constitution did not mention “social policy” because its framers believed local governments and states would implement the relatively few and small social programs needed by a rural society. The Constitution declared slavery to be legal in Southern states—and left unanswered whether new states on the Western frontier would be slave or free. The nation practiced genocide against Native Americans. Nor did it sufficiently protect women’s rights. Table 1.1. S oc i a l Wel fa re P ol i c y Era s i n U.S . Hi story Part 3 (1800–1932) discusses how the emerging nation transitioned rapidly from a rural to an industrial power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The United States was mostly a rural society prior to the advent of the Civil War in 1860. It developed an initial set of social policies mostly at local and state levels during this period that included almshouses and institutions for the mentally ill and orphans. The federal government auctioned off millions of acres of land on the frontier to immigrants and others. The nation maintained an open immigration system. It developed a system of public schools. It rapidly became an industrial nation in the decades leading up to 1900 when it became the world’s largest industrial power. It drew upon the labor of millions of immigrants from Asia, Mexico, Europe, and Russia. The nation developed only a small welfare state in the 19th century that increasingly became inadequate as the nation industrialized and as low- income immigrants migrated to the United States. The so-called Progressive Movement of the early 20th century, when the social work profession was born, created a series of regulations mostly in local and state governments over housing, food, and drugs—but that distributed few resources to low- Policy Time Period Social policy in a developing nation Early 17th century to 1800 Social policy in a nation transitioning from a rural to an industrial nation 1800–1932 Development of an American welfare state in a relatively liberal era 1933–1980 Social policy in a period of conservative backlash 1981–1992 Social policy in a period of gridlock and polarization 1992–present income persons. While slaves were freed during the Civil War in the middle of the 19th century, Jim Crow Laws in the Southern states did not allow them to vote, use public places, or serve on juries. Nor were they given sufficient land and resources to lift many of them from poverty. The United States wrested lands from Mexico in the American Southwest by invading Mexico City—and exploited Latinos by mostly relegating them to agricultural labor and denying them the vote. Native Americans were subjected to violence from private citizens and the military and mostly placed on reservations with few rights and resources. Irish, Italian, and Asian American immigrants, and other immigrants were subjected to considerable prejudice from the indigenous white population even as the nation used their labor to make goods in factories and build railroads. Part 4 (1933–1980) discusses how the United States developed an array of social policies during a relatively liberal era. It enacted scores of major social policies during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Great Society of the 1960s, and the Presidency of Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. President Franklin Roosevelt initiated an array of federal social policies for the first time in American history to address the survival needs of a nation with unemployment that ranged from 20% to 60% of the entire population. For the first time, the United States had a “welfare state” even if it was poorly funded—a welfare state that was significantly funded by the federal government even as public education was mostly funded by local units of government and states. While Roosevelt’s work relief programs were terminated in World War II, Social Security, unemployment insurance, and some welfare programs remained intact—as did many federal regulations such as abolition of child labor and the minimum wage. President Lyndon Johnson enacted scores of federal programs during the Great Society, including the Civil Rights Laws of 1964 and 1965, a War on Poverty, Medicare, Medicaid, many housing programs, federal assistance to schools, and many others. With collaboration from the Democratic Congress, Richard Nixon enacted many programs that rivaled the Great Society, including an expansion of Food Stamps; passage of housing programs and the Earned Income Tax Credit; and establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These many social programs were often underfunded, however, as social reformers found resources depleted by military spending in the Cold War, as well as the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Part 5 (1981–1992) discusses the rise of the conservative backlash against social polices enacted in the prior era, It was initiated by President Ronald Reagan and continued by President George H. W. Bush, Sr. Reagan markedly cut taxes and social spending while greatly increasing military spending. He moved many programs from the federal government to states by creating so-called block grant programs. He drew heavily on the economic theory of Arthur Laffer who contended that huge tax cuts would spur economic growth without increasing federal deficits—a theory that was disproven by the creation of debts larger than all previous presidents combined. President George Bush, Sr. succeeded Reagan in 1989—and maintained his conservative policies. He also maintained Reagan’s high military spending, frugal domestic budget, and low federal taxes. While the rights of disabled persons were advanced by enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, neither President Reagan nor Bush, Sr. significantly advanced the rights of other vulnerable populations. Part 6 (1992 to the present) discusses an era of gridlock and polarization lasting during the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Jr, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. Bill Clinton hoped to enact social investments that enhance economic opportunities for millions of Americans and national health insurance, but accomplished neither goal during a presidency where Republicans often controlled one or both houses of Congress. President George Bush, Jr. hoped to privatize Social Security and Medicare but accomplished neither of these conservative goals as Democrats often controlled one nor both chambers of Congress. President Barack Obama, the first African American president, successfully steered the nation out of the Great Recession of 2007 through 2009, enacted the Affordable Care Act, and advanced the civil rights of the LGBTQ population. But much of his presidency was marked by gridlock between the two parties and between liberals and conservatives. While Obama won landslide victories in 2008 and 2012, Republicans came to control Congress in landslide victories in 2010 and 2014 as well as many governorships. Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in a close victory in 2016, but accomplished few of his legislative goals in his first eleven months in office due to opposition from Democrats and elements of the Republican Party. We place the policy eras described in Parts 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 in Table 1.1 . It should be noted that some of the eras can be described as relatively liberal, others as relatively conservative, and others as gridlocked. While some social work historians view the so-called Progressive era (from roughly 1900–1917) as a relatively liberal era, it failed to enact major policies at the federal level of government, which is a hallmark of the liberal eras of the New Deal and the Great Society augmented by the reforms of President Nixon in the wake of the Great Society. The presidency of Donald Trump is described only in its first eleven months in Chapter 13 due to the date of the publication of this book. This book discusses the paradoxical nature of the American welfare state in Part 7 in Chapter 14 —that is, its reluctance (on the one hand), yet its significant size and growth (on the other hand). I explain its paradoxical nature by examining contextual cultural, economic, political, and other factors that have led to this result. I provide POLICY SCOREBOARDS at the end of chapters to follow the growth of the American welfare state during different eras, as well as a summary POLICY SCORECARD in Chapter 14 of important social policy reforms that currently exist that have critical importance to Americans. I identify flaws, omissions, and gaps in the American welfare state that need to be remedied or addressed by policy advocacy by social workers and others. I discuss in Chapter 14 challenges facing Americans in sustaining effective social programs and augmenting them in light of unaddressed and emerging social needs that the nation confronts as it moves into the next decade as illustrated by two examples. The United States currently possesses extreme economic inequality where the top 1% own 20% of the nation’s income, while people in the bottom 50% often live paycheck to paycheck and live in or near poverty. Experts contend, as well, that automation, robots, and self-driving technology could drastically reduce available jobs of workers in manufacturing, truck- driving, warehouse workers, janitors, and many other occupations. Were this to happen, economic inequality could become even more severe in the future. Recognize Polarization and Gridlock in the Last 35 Years As Table 1.1 suggests, the United States has been locked in ideological polarization and political gridlock from 1992 to the present during the presidencies of Clinton, Bush, Jr., and Obama, as well as the first year of Trump’s presidency. The presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Sr., could also be described as gridlocked with the exception of 1981 when Reagan enacted many conservative policies and when George Bush, Sr. enacted very few domestic policies. Ideological polarization is not new to American politics. Many conservative Republicans disliked, even hated, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Many Democrats viewed President Nixon with disdain. Democrats gridlocked Congress during portions of the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Sr. Deep ideological divisions existed in prior eras. As illustrated by Hamilton , the Broadway play, Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, key figures in the forming of the American Republic, possessed divergent views about the power and roles of the federal government. If Jefferson emphasized the role of states, Hamilton emphasized the role of the federal government. Many Republicans labeled President Franklin Roosevelt as a dictator and worse. We explore causes of extreme polarization in Chapters 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 . We identify competing belief systems in this chapter, as illustrated in Table 1.2 . LO 1-12 Table 1 .2 .

Contemporary conservatives view themselves as ideological descendants of the founding fathers, 19th-century capitalism, and presidents Coolidge, Hoover, Eisenhower, and Reagan. Libertarians , as Republican Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky, have sought to curtail government control or regulation of individuals. Emphasizing the Bill of Rights, they oppose laws that outlaw the use of drugs like cocaine, that prohibit abortion, or that censor publications. They want to enhance the freedom of individuals to the extent possible, in contrast to conservatives, who support the criminalization of specific drugs and abortion. Social reformers (today, we often refer to those who seek social reforms as liberals ), including Dorothea Dix, Jane Addams, Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, and Barack Obama, obtained enactment of a range of policy reforms despite the concerted opposition of conservatives and many interest groups. Contemporary liberals perceive themselves as ideological descendants of presidents Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, John Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson; professional leaders like social worker Jane Addams; and activists like Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez. These individuals were in the vanguard of the movement to build an American welfare state, even if the political opposition that they encountered meant that it was a reluctant welfare state. American radicals , including union organizers, socialists, and communists, have periodically pressured liberals and conservatives to consider major expansions of the welfare state, just as various social movements have sought reforms for specific causes. Senator Bernie Sanders described himself as a Democratic Socialist when he sought the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 2016—and was the only presidential candidate that spoke out against extreme economic inequality. American radicals trace their heritage to union organizers and legendary radical figures of the 19th and 20th centuries, such as Eugene Debs and Norman Thomas, as well as the socialists and communists of the 1930s. They often identify with grassroots social movements, including movements to abolish imprisonment for debt and to end slavery before the Civil War, the Industrial Workers of the World in the progressive era, the Southern Tenant Farmers Association, the unemployed workers movement, the industrial workers movement in the New Deal, the civil rights and welfare rights movements of the 1960s, organizations representing homeless persons in the 1980s, and the Occupy America movement in 2011 ( Figure 1.1 ).

People in societies with conflicting policies and relatively harsh traditions must at some point shape their personal values. As we study the evolution of the American welfare state, we engage in a voyage of personal discovery in which we develop our personal policy identity as we encounter specific developments and perspectives. Do we share the values of contemporary American conservatives, libertarians, liberals, or radicals? Do we favor the expansion of the federal government’s social welfare role, advocate the status quo, or want reductions in existing programs? What policies do we advocate with respect to contemporary social problems such as homelessness and the provision of medical care to those who cannot afford insurance? While recognizing that they are not homogeneous groups, we can compare conservatives, libertarians, liberals, and radicals with respect to 10 dimensions, as illustrated in Table 1.2 . They differ in their attitudes toward the federal government and state and local governments; in their beliefs about the causes of social problems; in their views of capitalism, human nature, the safety net, abortion, nongovernment associations and agencies, and subgroups; and in the core values they consider most important. For conservatives, freedom is fundamental; they value the freedom to retain personal wealth and to conduct enterprises with minimal public regulation. Conservatives are optimistic that unfettered capitalism will produce prosperity if government does not place excessive regulations on it. Rather than favoring government programs or tax policies that redistribute wealth, they believe that economic growth will “trickle down” to persons in the lower economic strata. Many conservatives believe, as well, that communities, families, churches, and nongovernment organizations can meet most needs of individuals and that these nongovernment entities can even replace many public programs—for example, by encouraging individuals and communities to care for homeless persons. To the extent that social programs are developed, many conservatives prefer to have them vested not with the federal government but with local and state governments, which would bear their full funding and implementation—or with the private sector, whether corporations or faith-based organizations. If local resources are unavailable to implement specific programs, conservatives often favor policies such as block grants, where state and local units of government receive fixed annual allowances from the federal authority in a particular realm (such as welfare or housing and community development) and are free within broad guidelines to decide precisely how to use them. Conservatives are relatively pessimistic about the fundamental nature of human beings, particularly those of limited means. They tend to believe that people in need can be corrupted by social programs—that is, that those who receive benefits will rely on them instead of seeking gainful employment. To counter what they regard as the “perverse incentives” provided by welfare and other social programs, many conservatives want to make social benefits less munificent and to set time limits and other conditions to their receipt. To prevent large numbers in the population from using social programs, conservatives usually want to tighten eligibility requirements. In contrast to their pessimism about persons in the lower economic strata, conservatives tend to be relatively optimistic about persons in the upper economic strata. Far from contending that wealth or inheritances might corrupt those individuals, conservatives want them to retain much of their wealth, on the assumption that they will place it in job-creating investments that will ultimately spur economic growth. In seeking the causes of social problems, conservatives often implicate personal or cultural factors. They contend that many people use social programs because they do not want to work or because American culture fails to emphasize “personal responsibility.” Conservatives do not emphasize disparities in economic and social status among subgroups (such as African Americans or women) and the general population and often dispute data suggesting that these disparities are wide or growing. Conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Sr. opposed civil rights legislation in the 1960s. Conservatives tend to oppose affirmative action, as well as redistributive policies such as increasing the tax rates on affluent Americans. They often question whether widespread discrimination exists or discount its importance. Conservatives are not a homogeneous group, as an examination of the contemporary Republican Party makes clear. Persons from the “religious right,” who constitute a large proportion of the contemporary conservative movement, strongly believe the government should act to restrict abortion, censor pornographic literature, outlaw certain drugs, and allow prayer in public schools. They have often clashed with other conservatives who oppose some of these policies. Some conservatives, such as Newt Gingrich, carry an antigovernment ethos far further than do moderate Republicans like Senator Susan Collins from Maine, who are more supportive of government programs, less inclined to cut domestic spending deeply, and more inclined to retain many government regulations. While often criticizing big government, conservatives support tax deductions for mortgage-holders, tax reductions on dividends and capital gains, and other policies that advance their economic interests. Nor do conservatives always act in a manner that is consistent with their stated principles. Even as they often oppose the expanding size of government, they also support specific social programs. Farmers in relatively conservative areas often support the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or the Food Stamps Program), partly because it expands markets for their products. Conservatives often support Medicare and Social Security programs partly because their relatives, as well as many constituents of conservative legislators, use and like them. Many persons who voted for Donald Trump protested Republicans’ attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act because they received health insurance from the ACA. Others protested cuts in Medicaid sought by Republicans because it funds treatment and counseling for poisoning from opioid drugs that killed roughly 60,000 persons in 2016. Libertarians like Representative Ron Paul agree with conservatives about the primacy of freedom, but—unlike conservatives—they oppose policies that enforce a single standard of public morality. For example, they oppose laws that restrict abortions, criminalize drugs, or impose censorship of journalism or art. Like conservatives, libertarians favor relatively low taxes, since they regard them as infringing on the economic independence of individuals. Libertarians are often critical about the sheer size of military involvements of the United States. However, liberals like President Barack Obama wanted to keep government powers more limited than do radicals, they are less sanguine than conservatives about unfettered capitalism. Left to its own devices, they contend, capitalism often produces considerable inequality, as is apparent from the disparities between wages, salaries, and private wealth that exist in the United States today. Moreover, they contend that many capitalists victimize people, such as avaricious landlords, entrepreneurs who pay low wages, banks that engage in fraud or that issue mortgages and loans to people who lack resources to fund them, and purveyors of tainted food and drugs. Believing that many people are subjected to discrimination in employment, education, use of public places, and accommodations, liberals often favored the enactment of civil rights legislation to protect rights of persons of color, disabled people, and women. Placing somewhat more emphasis on equality than do conservatives and wanting to restrict the victimization of people, liberals favor an array of government regulations and programs, such as minimum-wage legislation; regulation of working conditions; subsidies for persons of low income through welfare programs, Medicare, Medicaid, and SNAP; and job-training and Head Start programs to provide individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to be productive persons. Liberals are less inclined than are conservatives to believe that nongovernment associations, not-for-profit agencies, churches, or civic groups can solve or address major social problems without government assistance; however, they often support partnerships between government and these entities. Liberals are more optimistic about government’s ability to ameliorate major social problems such as poverty and homelessness, whereas conservatives emphasize the negative qualities of government bureaucracy and regulations, liberals are more inclined to support them. Liberals recognize disparities in economic and social status between vulnerable populations (such as women or African Americans) and the mainstream population. They favor redistributive policies, such as the progressive income tax, and redistributive programs like Medicaid, as well as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). Many liberals have supported civil rights laws for many vulnerable populations. Just as conservatives are not a homogeneous group, varieties of liberals exist. If some liberals favor a relatively expansive welfare state that attempts both to equalize opportunity and to decrease economic inequality ( stalwart liberals ), others are content to equalize opportunity through Head Start and similar programs and a minimal set of safety net programs such as food stamps, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP ( traditional liberals ). Stalwart liberals favor relatively generous welfare programs, tax policies that redistribute resources to people in the lower economic strata, and affirmative action programs that provide special assistance to groups who lag behind the rest of the population. Allies of Senator Bernie Sanders, who often call themselves progressive Democrats , strongly support national health insurance. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, is somewhat more cautious about major social reforms and is more like traditional liberals like Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, who emphasized educational, medical, and job-training supports for individuals, In the 1980s, the Democratic Leadership Conference (DLC) was established to develop a centrist position. Calling themselves “New Democrats,” they favored social reforms that promoted personal responsibility and opportunity. When DLC cofounder Bill Clinton became president from 1993 through 2000, he often followed a “moderately liberal” course, a course also favored by Al Gore, Democratic contender for the presidency in 2000. * The personal views of specific politicians are sometimes obscured by actions they take in response to their opposition. It is often difficult to know what specific politicians personally favor because they often are forced to respond to their opponents. Take the case of Democrat Barack Obama,who was elected to the presidency in 2008 and reelected in 2012. He seemed somewhat more liberal than President Bill Clinton, but encountered a gridlocked Congress. While he secured the enactment of national health insurance, bank regulations, and a huge stimulus program in his first two years in office in 2009 and 2010, he might have sought and obtained even more social reforms had Republican majorities in the Congress allowed him to enact them. Like their counterparts of other political ideologies, liberals do not always follow their stated principles. Favoring more equality, they often support tax loopholes and other tax concessions for large corporations. Even when they seek greater funding of social policies, they sometimes favor large tax cuts that deplete the Treasury. Many kinds of radical positions exist. Emphasizing equality, radicals are deeply pessimistic about the efficacy of unfettered capitalism in advancing social justice. Some radicals, such as socialists, want to transform capitalistic institutions into publicly run industries or favor worker ownership of corporations. Realizing that these policies are difficult to achieve because of the sheer power of corporations, radicals favor the major redistribution of wealth through tax policies, as well as far-reaching government programs that both provide services and benefits to all people residing in America and target them to less affluent residents. Senator Bernie Sanders favors a universal health programs that he calls Medicare for All. While liberals favor government programs and progressive taxes but usually want to keep them within certain limits, radicals have fewer inhibitions about far-reaching government interventions. Some radicals emphasize far-reaching reforms to help specific groups, such as African Americans and women. Some feminists favor, for example, far-reaching policies to equalize conditions between women and men—for example, children’s allowances, remuneration for raising families, affirmative action, aggressive collection of child support from former spouses, paid family leave, and a constitutional amendment to guarantee equal rights for women (see Figure 1.2 ). Figure 1.2. Wally McNamee/Corbis Historical/Getty Images; AP Images/Ruth Fremson Hybrid politicians: Richard Nixon (left) and Bill Clinton (right). Radicals are often critical of existing social policies, which, they argue, reflect the interests of corporate and conservative groups, such as American free-trade policies that often enrich corporations while ignoring working people in the United States and developing nations. Some radicals view government programs as a conspiracy to defuse pressure for social change by making relatively small concessions to working-class persons. They often advocate grassroots organizing to develop constituencies for radical policies, such as by unionizing workers in low-wage service industries. More than some liberals, radicals link the oppression of vulnerable populations to the economic and political subjugation of the working class, which subsumes many persons in those populations. To upgrade the economic and political status of women and African Americans, for example, they would favor sweeping economic reforms, such as curtailing the ability of corporations to move their operations to low-wage nations, seeking “living wage” policies, and decreasing high wages of corporate officials.

Select one of them and see if you can identify possible sources of compromise. What did you learn from this experience about values? Some people don’t neatly fit into the four kinds of ideologies that we have discussed. Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton often acted like liberals, seeking to enact major social programs while also seeking conservative measures as I discuss in Chapters 8 and 10 . Donald Trump espoused liberal programs during his candidacy for the Republican nomination as he advocated large infrastructure programs and (even) national health insurance. Yet he also sounded conservative themes—and many members of his cabinet were multimillionaires or billionaires. I titled Chapter 13 , “Donald Trump: Populist or Conservative Republican?” Develop Personal and Professional Policy Identities EP 1a The “raw stuff” of social welfare history provides a powerful tool for a personal voyage of discovery that helps us develop our own personal policy identities . We do not have the luxury of being neutral or above the fray when we examine an array of specific policies that were encountered by vulnerable populations from the colonial period onward. We see firsthand major American catastrophes like the Civil War, the depression of 1893, the Great Depression of the 1930s—when as many as 25% of Americans (and 75% of persons of color) became unemployed in a society that lacked virtually any safety net programs including unemployment insurance—and the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 and beyond. We view competition between military spending and domestic spending in such eras as the 1950s, when roughly three-fourths of the entire federal budget was consumed by military spending. We see the widespread lynching (hanging) of African Americans in the South in the first half of the 20th century—with crowds often gathering in a festive atmosphere to witness these executions. As we view these raw social needs and developments, we also observe how Americans responded to them. Once again, we do not have the luxury of neutrality. We ask, for example, were the work relief programs of the New Deal meritorious (as many liberals contended) or manifestations of “big government” (as many conservatives contended)? We ask if the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965 were meritorious (as many Democrats and moderate LO 1-13 Republicans contended) or ill-considered (as such Republicans as Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush contended)? We ask if the ACA of 2010 was meritorious, as all congressional Democrats decided, or poor legislation, as virtually all congressional Republicans and Donald Trump decided? We can use our perspectives from the past to inform our positions in contemporary society. For example, we might think contemporary policies are deficient when we learn that: An estimated 51,000 people experience homelessness in a single urban county (Los Angeles), including roughly 9,000 veterans and 12,500 chronically homeless—persons or families that have been homeless for one year or longer and possess serious health, mental health, or substance abuse problems * Three times more seriously mentally ill persons reside in jails and prisons than in hospitals * The United States ranks 31st of 34 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in income inequality, ranking ahead of only Chile, Mexico, and Turkey * About 40% of persons who “graduate” from foster care at age 18 become homeless in the next three years—and many become incarcerated About 50 million Americans lacked health insurance in 2013. * Moreover, the Republican House of Representatives supported a repeal of the Affordable Care Act that would have deprived 23 million Americans of health insurance in summer 2017, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) As we examine such complex social problems in American history as drug addiction, alcoholism, serious mental disorders, juvenile delinquency, and child abuse, we learn that easy answers or panaceas seldom exist. Since these problems are often caused by a variety of personal, familial, genetic, community, economic, cultural, and other factors, panaceas rarely work. Promising strategies nonetheless exist that can ameliorate major social problems even if they cannot eliminate them. In making judgments about policies in prior historical eras, we also learn that we must make them with due recognition of realities that reformers encountered. Federal, state, and local governments had relatively few resources in many historical eras compared with contemporary society— and they often possessed relatively primitive administrative or implementing capabilities. Americans in some historical eras had relatively low expectations about specific social problems, such as not even favoring civil rights legislation prior to the 1960s. Scant knowledge existed about the causes and incidence of specific social problems. While we may rightly criticize the failure of public officials to address specific problems in prior eras, we often cannot expect them to exercise some policy options that might be feasible in contemporary society. These provisos should not discourage us from developing our personal identities as we examine historical developments. We will discover that dissenting points of view often did exist in prior eras, such as opposition to slavery prior to 1860 and a desire for federal civil rights prior to 1964. Courageous policy advocates often did emerge—sometimes even endangering their lives when they championed unpopular causes. We can criticize policies in bygone eras even when little or no dissent existed during them. Even though relatively few white Americans opposed the public lynching of African Americans in the South in the 19th century and well into the 20th century, we can say that this practice violated the ethical principle of not killing. Even though most Americans agreed that women ought not go into professions mostly reserved for men in the 19th century, we can strongly disagree with this exclusionary policy on the grounds that it violates women’s civil rights. Social workers should expect to be outside mainstream opinion on some issues because of the nature of their work. We see firsthand persons widely regarded with indifference or suspicion by other citizens who do not actually work with homeless persons, persons with substance abuse, ex- offenders, or persons on welfare, As we examine the life stories of members of vulnerable populations, we often discover that many factors shaped their lives in ways that make it difficult to blame or condemn them for their problems—such as being abused as children or as adults, living in extreme poverty, lacking education, and suffering from other traumas. We also discover that people who do not know these life stories and who have not interacted with such persons often marginalize them. Social policy history provides us, then, with an ideal means of evolving our personal and professional policy identities , which consist of a set of explicit values and positions that shape our selection or rejection of policy choices. In our personal lives , we decide what causes and what public officials to support—or not to support. We decide what personal commitments to make to policy advocacy outside of our employment. In our professional lives , we decide what policies to question as an employee of an agency, when to participate with other social workers to seek to change specific policies, when to use agency resources to register voters, and when to support specific political candidates by contributing to the political action arm of the National Association of Social Workers (see Insert 1.5 ). Insert 1.5. Critically Reﬂecting on Your Professional Role: Where Am I at the Start of This Course? All of us are products of our families, communities, social class, education, employment, and many other factors. As you begin this course, what is your vision for our nation? How would you like to see it improve? What do you view as its current strengths and weaknesses? Can you ground your views in specific experiences that you have had with family members or a client or personally? Place your ideas in a brief essay. You might reread your essay when you reach Chapter 13 to see if you would make any changes to it—after you have used social welfare history to develop your identity as a professional social worker. You can do this by yourself or as part of a group. The reading of social welfare history serves, then, as a stepping stone into the contemporary era. It provides a safe environment in which to discuss controversial issues because it deals with historical events. It helps us ponder the merits of the contemporary welfare state because it discusses eras when it did not exist or hardly existed. It allows us to examine the merits of the federal government compared with state and local governments, as well as the private sector, because the federal government possessed a relatively small role until the Great Depression compared with the contemporary federal government. It allows us to gain understanding of diversity because of the sheer number of vulnerable populations who peopled the nation from its outset. Seek Common Ground while Honoring the Ethical Code of the National Association of Social W orkers As we develop our policy identities as professional social workers, we need to honor the profession’s Code of Ethic as developed by the National Association of Social Workers. (NASW). The Code of Ethics requires social workers to engage in “Political and Social Action,” as outlined in the society’s Code of Ethics that states: 1. “Social workers should engage in social and political action that seeks to ensure that all people have equal access to the resources, employment, services, and opportunities they require to meet their basic human needs and to develop fully. Social workers should be aware of the impact of the political arena on practice and should advocate for changes in policy and legislation to improve social conditions in order to meet basic human needs and promote social justice. 2. Social workers should act to expand choice and opportunity for all people, with special regard for vulnerable, disadvantaged, oppressed, and exploited people and groups. 3. Social workers should promote conditions that encourage respect for cultural and social diversity within the United States and globally. Social workers should promote policies and practices that demonstrate respect for difference, support the expansion of cultural knowledge and resources, advocate for programs and institutions that demonstrate cultural competence, and promote policies that safeguard the rights of and confirm equity and social justice for all people. LO 1-14 4. Social workers should act to prevent and eliminate domination of, exploitation of, and discrimination against any person, group, or class on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, political belief, religion, or mental or physical disability.” Social workers implement this Code of Ethics whenever they engage in micro, mezzo, and macro policy advocacy . They help persons obtain rights, services, benefits, and opportunities that they might not otherwise obtain through micro policy advocacy. They advance the well-being of persons, families, and communities when they engage in mezzo policy advocacy to reform dysfunctional agency policies or to work with community persons and groups to improve living conditions in specific neighborhoods or jurisdictions. They engage in social and political action when they participate in macro policy advocacy to reform government policies at local, state, and federal levels. They prioritize the needs of vulnerable populations when they engage in advocacy at each of these three levels. Social workers often can question specific assertions on ethical or empirical grounds. Here are some cases where empirical evidence can be used to question assertions as cited by Jansson (2017) in Becoming an Effective Policy Advocate (Boston: Cengage): Few users of safety-net programs work (in fact, most work) Low-income African American children rarely have heads of households who are employed (in fact, most work) Medical savings accounts would render Medicaid unnecessary as a federal-state program for low-income persons (in fact, they would not make Medicaid unnecessary) Increases in welfare or Medicaid benefits in a specific state will lure low-income people to it from other states in large numbers (in fact, relatively few people move) Bilingual programs harm the education performance of Latinos (in fact, they do not harm their education performance) Tax increases for millionaires will cut the nation’s economic growth (in fact, economic growth from 1952 through the 1970s, on average, was relatively high when millionaires top marginal rates exceeded 70% on average as compared with less than 40% currently) Welfare reforms in 1996 at the federal and state levels, which made access to welfare considerably more difficult for single heads of households, have greatly increased the incomes of low-income minority women by forcing them into the workplace (in fact, incomes of low-income minority women in the workplace remain unacceptably low) Political campaigns are often filled with false claims and arguments as was illustrated in the presidential election of 2016. Take findings of PolitiFact, a winner of the Pulitizer Prize, that analyzes the accuracy of politicians’ assertions. It contended that Donald Trump had made roughly 110 false statements and Hilllary Clinton had made 20 false statements during their presidential campaigns in 2016. Both of them had also made considerable numbers of “mostly true,” “half true,” and “mostly false” statements (see Aaron Sharockman, “Truth check: Clinton and Trump on the Truth-O- Meter,” November 1, 2016, accessed December 2, 2016 at www.Politifact.com ). Trump and Hillary Clinton have lots of company as we shall see in ensuing chapters. President Franklin Roosevelt’s Administration supported the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II on the false pretense that they were a threat to the nation’s security—and concealed data that was finally made public in a Supreme Court decision in 1986. Lyndon Johnson convinced the U.S. Congress to wage war against North Vietnam in 1965 by falsely claiming its Navy had attacked an American warship off the Vietnam coast. President George W. Bush falsely claimed that the Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq, had weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to get Congress to declare war on Iraq. We have discussed in this chapter how specific assertions or policies can be questioned on ethical grounds. Take the case of Montel Williams, an American television personality, who criticized a specific version of the draft of a replacement for the Affordable Care Act on CNN on June 23, 2017. Noting that more than 100 million Americans have chronic diseases that require medications and other medical treatments, he criticized the draft version on grounds that it would make deep cuts in Medicaid that allowed many of these Americans to obtain necessary medical treatment. Some unknown number of them will die because of their access to health care, he said, at a time when most legislators have expensive health plans provided to them by the government. Why not, he argued, enact a law that requires members of Congress to use the same health coverage as other Americans so that they do not enact laws as unfair and uncaring as this draft version? Treat Each Other with Civility Here are some rules that may often help us to have respectful dialogue in academic and other settings in a polarized nation, yet not concede values expressed in NASW’s Ethical Code. These guidelines appeared in Bruce Jansson, Social Welfare Policy and Advocacy (2016), SAGE, Thousand Oaks, CA, pp. 35–36. Guideline #1. Acknowledge that some policy issues are complex in nature since they involve ethical and scientific dimensions, so they do not lend themselves to consensus, even among reasonable people who share the same ideology, much less conflicting ones. Guideline #2. Identify commonalities if they can be found, such as such goals as reducing poverty, improving health, cutting the rate of suicide, and cutting health care costs. Guideline #3. Don’t “write off” specific solutions, but listen respectfully to ones that participants identify. Guideline #4. Identify specific research information about the effectiveness, cost, or other likely outcomes of specific remedies to the problem at stake. Discuss whether this information is accurate by identifying who produced it and with what research methodology. Discuss whether researchers agree about the likely outcomes of specific remedies. Acknowledge flaws in existing research to the extent they exist. When existing data are insufficient, state why a specific solution appears more meritorious than others based upon human behavior or other theory. LO 1-15 Guideline #5. Engage in respectful debate that does not negatively characterize opponents’ personal character, morality, or intentions— but that focuses on specific problems, possible solutions, ethical issues associated with specific solutions, and research information about the cost and effectiveness of the solutions. Guideline #6. Ascertain if compromises are possible that “split differences” between contending factions even if this often requires considerable time. Guideline #7. Do not assume that policy advocacy is not feasible because different people have different values and points of view. By withdrawing from policy arenas, you increase the likelihood that opposing groups will prevail. Guideline #8. Do not violate NASW’s Code of Ethics by conceding its key points to persons who do not honor its provisions. Arguments and push-back are often necessary when others hold views that violate the Code of Ethics. As a social worker in training, you are obliged to support the rights, opportunities, benefits, and services that enhance the well-being of vulnerable populations. Learning Outcomes After reading this chapter, you are now equipped to: Engage in ethical reasoning and analytic thinking to state why Americans need a welfare state by identifying ill consequences from have no welfare state, particularly for vulnerable populations Analyze different kinds of policies by their form, purpose, and grouping or clustering, as well as whether they shape funding and implementing systems, and define the term welfare state Analyze how the American welfare state has evolved in a series of eras Identify specific vulnerable populations that have often been oppressed in prior eras, as well as the contemporary period Compare and contrast the ideologies of conservatives, libertarians, liberals, and radicals, as well as persons with hybrid views Define and develop personal and professional policy identities Identify specific practice modalities that are encouraged by the study of social welfare history, including policy-sensitive practice and policy advocacy at micro, mezzo, and macro levels Discuss the symbiotic, yet uneasy, relationship between social workers and the American welfare state—and how social workers engage in policy practice and policy advocacy to be effective professionals (EPAS 2.1.3) Define policy identity and understand why social workers need to evolve them at both personal and professional levels. Competency Notes EP 1a Social workers make ethical decisions by applying standards of the NASW Code of Ethics, relevant laws, models for ethical decision-making, ethical conduct of research, and additional codes of ethics as appropriate to context. EP 2a Social workers apply and communicate understanding of the importance of diversity and difference in shaping life experiences in practice at the micro, mezzo, and macro levels. EP 3a Social workers apply their understanding of social, economic, and environmental justice to advocate for human rights at the individual and system levels. EP 3b Social workers engage in practices that advance social, economic, and environmental justice. EP 5a Social workers identify social policy at the local, state, and federal level that impacts well-being, service delivery, and access to social services. EP 5b Social workers assess how social welfare and economic policies impact the delivery of and access to social services. Endnotes 1.

It began with virtually no social policies in the colonial era—and even these were mostly at the local level with minimal funding as we discuss in Chapter 3 . The United States currently has thousands of social policies at local, state, and federal levels that absorb hundreds of billions of dollars as we discuss in Chapters 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 . Not all of these social policies are meritorious, but many of them do help ordinary people to survive and thrive. Just imagine, for example, if vocational training did not exist. Or if the nation had no junior colleges or baccalaureate colleges or professional schools—all created and funded by social policies. Or if Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), subsidized school lunches, Medicare, Medicaid, and rent subsidies did not exist. Even many entities in the private sector, such as the private health insurance used by roughly 85% of Americans, depend on tax incentives from the federal government—themselves social policies. Were this book only to describe these many policies, we would lack deeper understanding of how they emerged. We would be unable to understand why the nation developed poorhouses during the early years of the American Republic, why it didn’t develop major federal social policies until the Great Depression, why many social policies enacted in the 1960s lacked sufficient funding, and why the United States failed to enact national health insurance like European nations and Canada. Nor could we understand why Franklin Roosevelt was overwhelming elected to the presidency in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Nor could we understand why Donald Trump was narrowly elected to the presidency in 2016—or why and how he and his allies defeated some policies that Barack Obama, his predecessor, had enacted. Nor could we understand how policies are developed in social agencies and communities. Nor could we understand how social workers help their clients gain access to specific policies and programs that have been enacted by local, state, and federal governments. This book uniquely uses Figure 2.1 as its conceptual framework. We begin with the policy context that includes culture, traditions, players, interest groups, levels of conflict, funding, and court decisions. We want to know how these and other factors determine whether and why specific policies are enacted or approved in a community, agency, or legislature—or whether and why they are defeated. We also want to identify factors that determine whether specific clients or consumers use benefits, resources, and services provided by specific policies—or whether they decided not to use them. We now discuss the elements of Figure 2.1 . Figure 2.1. Details SOURCE : From Jansson, Brooks/Cole Empowerment Series: Becoming an Effective Policy Advocate, 7E. © 2014 Cengage.

The Context Diagnosing the Context in Legislative Settings and the Nation An array of contextual factors influence ordinary people and legislators as they consider and select social policies in specific eras. When we decide to engage in policy advocacy, we need skills in diagnosing the context as it both facilitates and impedes specific policy reforms. (See where diagnosing the context is located at the top and bottom of Figure 2.1 , the policy advocacy framework.) The context includes cultural, economic, institutional, social, and legal factors, as well as the sequencing or timing of key events. In the succeeding chapters, we discuss these factors as they have shaped policy selection in various eras—and as they continue to shape the selection of policies in the contemporary period and in coming decades. Think about the T wo-Sided Context: Opportunities and Constraints EP 4b EP 5c Policy practitioners and advocates in the United States have often confronted a two-sided context. On the one hand, the United States has often provided a difficult environment for achieving many policy reforms. On the other hand, policy advocates have often found that many contextual factors facilitated the enactment of reforms in specific eras and in contemporary society. As shown in the following list, contextual factors have provided both opportunities and constraints for policy advocates who wished to reform social policies in the United States in specific historical eras. These factors will be discussed in succeeding chapters. We will discuss at greater length the ways in which many of them continue to shape the evolution of the American welfare state. 1. Cultural factors include the way Americans perceived the importance and causes of specific social problems, the extent they believed that those in need were responsible for the problems, and the extent they thought that society has an obligation to assist those in need with ameliorative programs. We discuss how perceptions of various subgroups within the population, such as women and racial groups, shaped social policies. LO 2-1 With respect to cultural factors that often created constraints for policy reformers, we shall ask to what extent Americans developed a multifaceted mythology to justify their failure to develop a relatively generous welfare state, including: Believing that many social problems derive from defects of character rather than from environmental conditions Believing that charitable acts mostly bring adverse consequences such as encouraging recipients to be lazy, encouraging fraudulent use of social programs, encouraging large numbers of persons to rely on public welfare rather than working, and slowing economic growth by diverting resources from investments in the economy to charity Believing that specific problems can be “solved” with use of panaceas, thus impeding deeper analysis of the causes and persistence of many social problems—and the need for innovative and far-reaching solutions Falsely believing that a generous welfare state is not needed because ample opportunities exist for all people who live in America to become relatively affluent Believing that private markets, left to themselves, can solve most social problems—and that social programs and regulations wrongly upset or disrupt private markets Viewing government and government institutions as intrinsically flawed so that they can seldom assume constructive, effective roles in averting or addressing social problems Believing that economic and social inequality is not only inevitable, but motivates low-income persons to work harder so they can become substantially more affluent We shall also ask what cultural factors have created opportunities for policy advocates, including: Sympathizing with persons who are perceived to be victims of circumstance—and therefore to be “deserving” of assistance from the welfare state, such as children and older adults Resenting persons and interests that unfairly victimize specific populations—therefore creating support for regulations and civil rights Favoring provision of policies and programs that enhance opportunities for specific populations, such as preschool education and job training programs Favoring programs and policies that reflect rights conferred by the Constitution and statutes such as due process, civil rights, the ability of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce, and the right of the federal government to advance the “general welfare” Believing that all who live among us should have their minimal survival needs met so that persons do not starve, go entirely without medical care, or have no shelter The emergence of a powerful liberal ideology that favored the enactment of an array of social programs, regulations, and civil rights, particularly in the 20th and 21st centuries The creation of a liberal coalition in the 1930s by President Franklin Roosevelt, often allied with the Democratic Party, that obtained enactment of a wide range of policies in succeeding decades up to the present—including persons of color, women, Jews, intellectuals, environmental groups, civil rights groups, and low-income persons. This coalition also included a large majority of white working class and Catholic voters until the 1980s when some of them switched their allegiance to Republican candidates 2. Economic factors include the extent to which the government possessed resources, such as tax revenues, to fund social programs; the extent to which corporations provided social benefits to employees; and the budgetary priorities of governments. Economic constraints include: Believing that taxation is intrinsically evil—leading to such low taxes that insufficient revenues exist to support specific social policies Believing that affluent persons should pay relatively low taxes since higher ones will jeopardize their willingness and ability to make job-creating investments Believing that it is better to run substantial annual budget deficits than to raise taxes—thus enhancing antispending sentiment on grounds it will raise deficits Competition between military spending and some kinds of domestic spending Favoring relatively harsh treatment of immigrants in specific policy areas, such as depriving them of legal rights and the ability to benefit from social programs—particularly when they are perceived as taking jobs away from citizens Conferring huge tax concessions upon affluent Americans in the tax code by way of deductions, tax credits, and tax loopholes Economic factors that provide opportunities for policy advocates include: The sheer size of national economic resources in the United States, creating a large reservoir of national income that can fund social programs The existence of entitlements that are less susceptible to cuts because they are automatically funded each year to the level of claimed benefits rather than having to compete for funding with other programs in the general budget—such as Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, SSI, and unemployment insurance The relatively high rate of economic growth in the United States in specific eras that created opportunities for many people The American proclivity to use the tax code to help persons obtain assets and gain income, such as tax deductions for interest payments on mortgages—and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for low-income families The existence of a vast frontier in the colonial period and the 19th century that created opportunities for many people, including immigrants from Europe as they acquired land The willingness of Americans to allow many immigrants to come to the United States 3. Institutional factors include the extent to which governments possessed administrative capabilities to develop and implement social programs and the balance between federal, state, and local jurisdictions in social policy. Institutional factors that provide constraints to policy advocates include: Believing that the federal government ought not to assume major roles in funding, administering, or monitoring the American welfare state—while idealizing the ability of state and local governments to assume these roles Buck-passing by federal authorities to the states—or state authorities to the federal government—so that no level of government addresses important issues or problems Simplistically believing that the private sector can address or solve social problems Channeling public resources through private entities and faith- based organizations without sufficient governmental monitoring Institutional factors that have provided opportunities to policy advocates include: The sheer number of entities that can contribute to policy solutions including federal, state, and local governments, as well as the public and private sectors—providing policy advocates with many points of access The diminishing of corruption, patronage, and nepotism in American government institutions in the 20th and 21st centuries compared with 19th century and early 20th century practices 4. Social factors include wars, migrations of populations, demographic changes, industrialization, global economic competition, and urbanization—that is, changes in the social environment that shape the selection of policies. Social factors that have provided constraints to policy advocates include: Considerable prejudice, such as sexism, racism, classism, xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and homophobia Competition between vulnerable populations for scarce resources, such as between African Americans and Latinos Social factors that have provided opportunities include: Empowerment strategies of advocacy groups representing vulnerable populations, as well as self-help and other survival strategies of these populations Some diminishing in overt prejudice in the United States since the advent of civil rights legislation for specific vulnerable populations The powerful roles of the Great Depression and the civil rights movements in fostering social and political pressure for enactment of an array of social reforms 5. The sequencing of events describes the effects of the timing of important developments in the evolution of the U.S. welfare state. Sequencing events that have provided constraints to policy advocates include: The relatively late development of American federal social programs, aside from veterans’ programs, until relatively late in its national history—that is, in the 1930s and succeeding decades. This late development of a substantial American welfare state contributed to American reluctance to fund a generous welfare state because many people in America did not experience its positive benefits until relatively late in their national history compared with many European nations The emergence of the Cold War in the late 1940s that led to military spending that constricted resources for domestic spending in succeeding decades—with high military spending continuing even after the end of the Cold War in 1991 Sequencing events that provided opportunities to policy advocates include: Policy reforms in specific eras (such as the progressive, New Deal, and Great Society eras) have facilitated reforms in succeeding eras by setting precedents that expanded the horizons of many Americans to include social reforms they often considered to be not feasible prior to that era 6. Legal factors have assumed major significance in the development of the American welfare state because of the importance of federal and state Constitutions, as well as court decisions, in shaping public policies Legal factors that have provided constraints for policy advocates include: The assumption by many public officials and courts until well into the 1930s that the federal government lacked a constitutional basis for developing social policies because the U.S. Constitution did not explicitly mention social policy as an enumerated power for the federal government—thus implying state and local governments should assume this role Adverse rulings by lower courts, as well as the Supreme Court, that undermined the ability of state and federal governments to issue regulations and enforce civil rights policies Legal factors that have provided opportunities for policy advocates include: Court rulings that have supported the ability of state and federal governments to develop regulations, civil rights legislation, and social programs, particularly from the late 1930s onward The emergence of public interest legal advocacy groups that have brought many successful class action suits on behalf of vulnerable populations 7. Political factors include power resources and tactics of specific interest groups, legislators, presidents and other chief executives, and professional groups. Political factors that have provided constraints to policy advocates include: Relatively weak trade unions in the United States compared with many European nations, making it difficult to rally support for reforms that assist working-class populations Nonvoting by significant numbers of low-income persons in the United States, detracting from support for many social reforms The sheer power of American conservatives throughout American history Diversion of efforts by liberals to fighting against moral crusades by temperance, antidrug, antiobscenity, antigay, anticrime, and antiabortion projects The role of powerful interest groups, including fundamentalist religious groups in the decades following 1980, groups representing corporate interests (such as the American Chamber of Commerce), and affluent contributors to political campaigns in creating opposition to social reforms The relatively conservative nature of leadership in the Republican Party, particularly from 1930 to 1960 and from 1980 to 2018 Political factors that have provided opportunities for policy advocates include: Development of large unions in the late 1930s and succeeding decades that have financed relatively liberal political candidates and supported relatively liberal legislation Some relatively liberal presidents, including Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama The relatively liberal nature of the modern Democratic Party, particularly its northern wing, from the 1930s onward The ability of social programs to attract additional support for themselves from their beneficiaries, such as elderly persons supporting Medicare and Social Security—and their ability to generate support from providers, such as support for Medicare from hospitals and physicians As we examine the impact of contextual factors on social policy, we will discover that, in every era, some contextual factors inhibited the development of ameliorating policies while others promoted such policies. We return to many of these factors in specific chapters and also review their cumulative effects in contributing to the reluctance of the American welfare state in Chapter 14 . Three Kinds of Policy Advocacy Policy advocacy takes place at three levels: Social workers engage in micro policy advocacy (sometimes called case advocacy or patient advocacy) to help individuals navigate and use existing social programs. Social workers engage in mezzo policy advocacy when they help members of specific communities or groups to develop meritorious policies that improve the wellbeing of community members—and when they seek to change dysfunctional policies of specific agencies or government departments. Social workers engage in macro policy advocacy when they work to enact policies of local, state, and federal governments, as well as to obtain sufficient funding for them. Micro Policy Advocacy When consumers’ unaddressed needs are serious rather than trivial, including needs that can be life-threatening, social workers have an ethical obligation to provide persons with micro advocacy if they believe they will not otherwise receive assistance for these problems. Take the example of homeless persons who often use emergency departments (EDs) for health care. Assume that the health staff decides to release a homeless person with serious medical and mental health problems before he is stabilized sufficiently to be able to cope when he is released. Assume that you are a social worker in the ED and that you are convinced this person will suffer serious harm if he is prematurely released before his immediate health conditions are stabilized and before a safe destination is identified. Were you not to engage in case advocacy to delay his release and to find a safe destination, you would violate your ethical duty to advance his well-being —as well as laws that require health professionals not to release patients before they are medically stabilized. Referrals are an important part of social work practice because they link persons to services, benefits, and rights that they might not otherwise obtain. Some referrals are “passive ones,” where a social worker advises persons to contact specific agencies or professionals but without following up to see if they actually saw them or received help from them. Persons who have serious or life-threatening conditions, such as suicidal patients, often need “active” referrals, where social workers contact the person who was referred to specific agencies or professionals to see if they actually received help. They might, as well, contact the person who they referred to ascertain not only if they received assistance but also whether it was helpful to them. Persons need micro policy advocacy in three situations: Insert 2.1. Critical Analysis: People’s Problems that May Require Micro Policy Advocacy Take any policy sector other than health care and analyze whether people who use services or programs in them also experience these seven problems, drawing on your personal experiences or what you have observed in a field placement. Then take one of them and identify some possible reasons why persons do experience this problem. Is it because of deficiencies in services, benefits, and rights of the programs that they use, inadequate funding, or persons’ lack of awareness or disinclination to use specific services or seek specific benefits—or for other reasons? when they need benefits, services, or rights that are not currently available to them; (1) when they may be entitled to specific benefits, services, or rights, but they are denied them by personnel in agencies; and (2) when specific benefits, services, or rights are available to them, but they do not use them (see Insert 2.1 ). (3) 1. Needed benefits, services, and rights are not available . You will encounter this situation many times in your journey through American history because many of the benefits, services, and rights provided by the American welfare state have been put in place only relatively recently. Social workers in 1929 when the Great Depression began could not refer their clients to most of the programs we now take for granted because they did not exist, such as unemployment insurance or the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP)—or hardly existed, such as publicly subsidized outpatient mental health services. They often do not exist, as well, in contemporary society, such as health insurance for millions of Americans or subsidized housing for millions of low-income persons. Other services exist but are so poorly funded that long waiting lists exist, such as for substance abuse counseling. Micro policy advocates have to be inventive under these circumstances, possibly finding services offered by the private sector, linking persons to community resources, and helping them develop survival or empowerment skills. They can sometimes find charitable care for persons, such as medically uninsured persons whose care is financed by charitable funds at a specific hospital or clinic. 2. Services, benefits, and rights to which people are entitled but denied . Many consumers are entitled to specific services, benefits, and rights —but do not receive them. In yet other cases, their entitlement to them is contested, such as by state or federal disability officials who question whether a specific person is sufficiently disabled to be entitled to specific benefits under Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI). Professionals who are not attorneys can sometimes help specific persons locate legal resources that may ultimately lead to litigation to get specific benefits or services—or to secure specific rights. As an example, some 12,000–16,000 homeless people regularly cluster in an area of downtown Los Angeles known as Skid Row. A number of social agencies provide social services and some housing. Still, there is not enough temporary shelter (in missions and those provided by social agencies), transitional (single-room occupancy hotels and programs designed to help selected homeless people get through a crisis), or long-term assisted housing to meet the needs of all. The result is that thousands of the homeless sleep on the streets of Skid Row. A lucky few huddle in cardboard boxes, under a highway bridge, or in dumpsters. Their 24-hour presence impacts the streets of the area. They constituted a subsociety, a magnet for other homeless people. Many have been released from prison or hospitals. Most lack services from social agencies. But the real estate that they occupy is alongside a burgeoning commercial and high-rent residential area. Developers want to clear the seamy sights of homeless people from the neighborhood and claim their sites for luxury high rises. Elected officials are often influenced by wealthy contributors to their campaigns, and are tempted by the prospect of private developments that would generate more taxes to provide increased services for everyone. So complaints about the homeless blocking the sidewalks, creating a sanitary problem on the public way, or intimidating shoppers and office workers in nearby buildings, together with concerns about their drawing dope dealers and prostitutes to Skid Row, led the City Council to pass an ordinance (L.A. Cal. Mun. Code § 41.18(d) 2005) used by the police to clear the homeless away, tear down their cardboard shelters, and arrest those who slept on the streets. Social workers led the protest and linked the homeless to American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyers. Two who were convicted and sentenced for violating the ordinance, along with four others who were threatened with arrest, prosecution, incarceration, and conviction for violating it, sought an injunction against the ordinance and the arrests. Under a federal civil rights statute (42 USC 1983), alleging that enforcement of the municipal code violated their constitutional rights, they filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California ( Edward Jones v. City of Los Angeles ). Although they lost at the trial court level, they appealed. On April 14, 2006, the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded the case (444 F.3d 1118), ruling that because there was substantial and undisputed evidence that the number of homeless persons in the city far exceeded the number of available shelter beds at all times, the city encroached on the rights of the homeless by criminalizing the unavoidable act of sitting, lying, or sleeping at night on public sidewalks while being involuntarily homeless. The court found that the Eighth Amendment (which bars cruel and unusual punishment) prohibits the state from punishing an involuntary act or condition if it is the unavoidable consequence of one’s status or being, here a consequence of being human and homeless without shelter in the city. Professionals can also direct clients to administrative tribunals or courts when they believe they have been denied benefits or services to which they are entitled. Once rights are established and programs are authorized (as seen in the examples above), programs have to be established to implement them. Generally, the enabling legislation delegates responsibility for administering such programs to a new or ongoing public agency, authorizing it to develop rules and procedures for carrying out its work. A first draft of such regulations is submitted for a period of public review and comments are invited. Social workers frequently offer input to the proposed rules and procedures that are considered by the agency and may be integrated into the final regulations. Once they are adopted, their implementation typically provides for an administrative tribunal to allow appeal, review, and possible modification of any actions taken with regard to any individual or group. Such tribunals are run by neutral administrative judges who can order the agency to change its practice, pay compensation, and make the client whole. Social workers may advise their clients that they can appeal changes in their benefits from most federal and state programs such as Social Security, disability, or unemployment compensation. And you can either link them to a lawyer (who in most cases will be paid a statutory fee, one set by law that will not cost your client anything). They can seek administrative review of discrimination on their jobs due to race, gender, religion, national origin, age (if 40 or older), or disability, drawing upon lawyers provided (without cost to the client) by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of their state’s Fair Employment and Housing Commission. They can appeal denial of proper compensation for overtime, and the denial or constriction of countless benefits established in law. As an example of an administrative tribunal, Judge Ralph Fertig, as an administrative judge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), was able to order the hiring of a qualified man, represented by a social worker, who had applied in vain to be a mail carrier. The U.S. Postal Service had repeatedly passed him over because he wore a large turban and insisted on his right, as a Sikh, to wear it while delivering mail. Judge Fertig found the Postal Service had violated the law against religious discrimination. The man was given the job and back pay to the time when he was first denied a position, and because the government appealed his ruling to the federal court, he received more. His order was upheld, the Postal Service had to pay him full salary for the years his case was tied up in appeal, and the Postal Service was enjoined to never deny any work benefits to anyone because he wore a turban. Such rulings take place in administrative tribunals, but getting to them can intimidate or confuse clients. Often, the details of a client’s claim are lost in the bureaucratic procedures of the agencies and overloaded intake workers through which one must begin the process. But social workers can go with their clients to the administrative agencies to ensure that their entreaties are properly understood, filed, and moved on to the administrative tribunal. Social workers may also work with lawyers in preparation for and at the hearing held by the administrative judge and be witnesses on their behalf. All administrative tribunals recognize the right of social workers to fully represent their clients as advocates in place of lawyers, as in the case just described. Furthermore, it is in the interaction between the intended beneficiaries of social programs, those who manage and distribute those benefits, and lawyers that social workers can discern needs and help transmute them into rights by changing the system, its policies, procedures, and regulations. Sometimes that means going to court for injunctive relief (as in Jones v City of Los Angeles , earlier); sometimes that means seeking new laws (as in SB 1322, later); and sometimes it means serving as an advocate for your clients, one at a time, before an administrative tribunal. In some instances, of course, clients are denied services, rights, and benefits because of errors made by eligibility and other staff. Micro policy advocates can help clients ask specific questions to these staff to determine if errors were made, as well as review eligibility criteria used by specific programs. When clients are unable to self-advocate in this manner, micro policy advocates can intercede for them or accompany them to meetings with eligibility staff. 3. Persons who do not use services, benefits, and rights for which they are eligible and that they need . Many persons do not use services, benefits, and rights even when they need them. Only about one-half of persons who are eligible for SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, use it—leading to a considerable loss of resources as well as food for themselves and their families. Only about one-half of eligible Americans use the EITC, which gives working adults and their families federal tax rebates when they file their federal income tax forms in the spring of each year—even though these EITC benefits constitute the largest American antipoverty program that can bring thousands of dollars of additional income to specific families in a given year. Micro policy advocates must diagnose why specific persons do not use services, benefits, and rights to which they are eligible and that they need. These persons may be unaware of them. They may falsely think they are not eligible for them. They may believe that they will be dealt with in a harsh manner by program personnel. They may feel ashamed to have specific problems, such as HIV/AIDS, a mental health condition, or no job. They may fear that they will not receive culturally competent care, such as translation services. They may not want to negotiate lengthy application forms. They may lack transportation or be unable to take time from their work to apply for benefits. Many people are also unaware of their rights. Some women may be unaware that numerous state and federal laws protect them from sexual harassment on the job. Persons with disabilities may be unaware of rights conferred to them by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as well as other statutes. Persons who use the health system may not be aware that court rulings uphold their right to informed consent before they are given medical treatment. Micro policy advocates help specific clients obtain services, benefits, and rights that they need to advance their well-being but might not obtain without their help . Let’s use the example of health care to illustrate the pivotal role of micro policy advocates. Health consumers often experience seven problems: they do not receive: Ethical care , such as informed consent for treatments or tests they receive, maintenance of the confidentiality of their care, inaccurate or incomplete information about their health condition, and unnecessary care Quality care , such as evidence-based care based on research findings, care from qualified providers, and care based on best approaches for not injuring or harming them Culturally competent care that gives translation services to persons who have limited English proficiency, choice of providers from the persons’ own cultural background, and care that is sensitive to specific culturally based preferences and views Preventive care that strives to prevent serious medical conditions even from arising (primary prevention) or that seeks to stabilize them before they become serious (secondary prevention) Affordable care that allows all persons, regardless of their financial resources, to obtain necessary care Care that addresses mental health and substance abuse issues that exist independently of physical illness or that are linked to it Community-based care so that persons receive care for their physical and mental conditions in their communities rather than exclusively in medical settings These seven problems many Americans face in health care are also experienced by them when they receive services or benefits from child welfare, mental health, education, income maintenance, gerontology, and other agencies. Social workers have engaged in micro policy advocacy from the inception of the profession in the late 19th century to the present. They helped destitute immigrants gain access to public health services in the early part of the 20th century. They helped impoverished youth join work-relief programs in the Great Depression, such as the Civilian Conservation Corps. They helped African Americans gain access to programs of the Great Society such as Medicaid. They helped Latino immigrants avoid deportation in the latter decades of the 20th century. They helped gay males obtain health services when the AIDS epidemic took off in the 1980s and 1990s. They helped persons of all backgrounds gain health insurance from state insurance exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act during the presidency of Barack Obama. Mezzo Policy Advocacy Social workers use mezzo policy advocacy when they wish to modify policies of the agencies that employ them. Examples include: A social worker wishes to develop a new program that impacts populations in the community that have not been helped by an agency’s existing programs, such as an outreach program to homeless persons A social worker wants to develop regulations that place limits on the number of fast food outlets in a specific community when none exist A social worker wants to pressure a city to tighten its enforcement of housing codes when she observes unhealthy living conditions of many tenants A social worker helps organize a community coalition against a decisions by a city planning department to construct a major highway through a low-income community Social workers staffed settlement houses in scores of cities from the late 19th century through the 20th century that engaged in mezzo policy advocacy extensively. Jane Addams directed Hull House, the most famous settlement house, for decades that reached into the community to help destitute immigrants. Even though settlement houses have mostly closed, staff in any mental health, child welfare, health, educational, or other agency can engage in mezzo policy advocacy. Macro Policy Advocacy Social workers engage in macro policy advocacy when they want to change public policies at city, county, state, and federal levels. They may wish to expand eligibility levels for a state’s Medicaid program because the current level excludes many people who need health coverage. They may wish to obtain state legislation that prohibits placing juvenile in isolation to punish them for specific acts even when researchers have discovered that protracted isolation can cause serious mental problems. Macro policy advocates can form and participate in coalitions. We provide a policy-advocacy framework to help us to identify and understand a set of activities and strategies that reformers have used—no matter the historical era (see Figure 2.1 ). Whether the reformers were Dorothea Dix in the 1840s, Jane Addams near the turn of the 20th century, Frances Perkins in the New Deal, Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, or someone trying to make American immigration policies more humane in the contemporary period, they had to decide what is right and what is wrong and navigate the American welfare state, diagnose opportunities as well as constraints in context, place issues on agendas of decision makers, analyze social problems, develop proposals, get proposals enacted, implement policy reform , and assess policy reforms . Link Micro Policy Advocacy to the American Welfare State EP 5c Our discussion strongly suggests how knowledge of the evolution of the American welfare state facilitates micro policy advocacy. We may not fully understand the importance of micro policy advocacy and referrals to many persons if we have not analyzed periods in American history where relatively few services, benefits, and rights were available to persons through the American welfare state. Take the case of unemployed youth during the Great Depression who were often evicted from their parents’ homes because they lacked resources to support even themselves—and who then became itinerant persons, often riding freight trains to a succession of towns where they received food in bread lines or from begging. Only with the advent of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a federal program that gave employment to young males often in state and federal parks, was any major resource available to this population. To effectively help persons, then, social workers need to understand the many programs of the American welfare state as they have evolved through time. They have to know who funds them, what the eligibility standards are, and what services they provide. They need to be familiar, as well, with civil rights statutes and rights that protect specific persons. Social welfare history also alerts social workers to the insufficiency of many services, benefits, and rights in a nation with strong suspicion of LO 2-2 government, as well as relatively harsh orientations toward many vulnerable populations. Male youth who lost work during the Great Recession of 2007–2009 and beyond have been better off than their counterparts in the 1930s but often encountered difficult circumstances. Many of them could remain with their parents because they could better support themselves with resources provided to them by the American welfare state, such as the EITC and SNAP, but they had to use a harsh and demeaning welfare program, known as General Assistance (GA), that provides meager benefits, if they remained unemployed. Many of them lacked health insurance until a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 allowed youth to receive health insurance from their parents’ health policies until they are 26 years of age. Many of them found it difficult to enroll in community colleges once they had completed high school since they could not afford books and mounting tuition. With relatively few vocational training programs for unemployed youth, moreover, they often found it difficult to upgrade their skills to make them more employable. Social welfare history also alerts us to services, benefits, and rights that exist in the American welfare state as they have been incrementally added to it, particularly in the 20th and 21st centuries. They have been added through statutes, court rulings, and administrative regulations, as well as accreditation standards for hospitals, clinics, and social agencies. Social workers need to be familiar with this policy context—and be able to locate policy resources for their clientele through the Internet and other sources. Consider this course to provide an introduction, then, to the resources, rights, and services of the American welfare state. It helps us understand the limits, as well as the strengths, of the American welfare state. Consider it, as well, as an introduction to micro policy advocacy as an integral part of social work practice. Link Micro Policy Advocacy to Macro Policy Advocacy Social workers can link micro policy advocacy to macro policy advocacy when they observe gaps, omissions, and flaws in policies in specific cases that they encounter in their work. Assume, for example, that a hospital social worker discovers that her hospital often does not provide translation services to some of her patients with limited English proficiency—as required by federal civil rights statutes and some state statutes, as well as hospital accreditation standards. (She learned about the civil rights statute when studying the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965.) This observation led her to develop a coalition in the hospital of nurses and social workers to pressure hospital administrators to augment translation services. As they talked with their hospital administrators, they discovered, as well, that their state did not use a provision in the federal Medicare and Medicaid statutes that allowed them to receive funding for translation services from these programs—if their state agreed to contribute a share of the cost, as well. They contacted their state’s Association of Nurses, as well as its chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, to develop a proposal to the legislature to tap into these resources to help hospitals finance translation services. LO 2-3 Examine Policy Practice and Policy Advocacy EP 5a EP 5b The policy advocacy framework makes clear that policy advocates never work in a vacuum. They diagnose the context to identify both constraints and opportunities when they wish to change existing policies. Sometimes, they are overpowered by the context, such as when powerful forces and factors exist that are unfavorable to a proposed policy reform. When such feminists as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton proposed even before 1860 that women should be given the right to vote, for example, the sexism of the nation, as well as powerful interest groups, proved to be too strong for them to surmount. Despite their best efforts and their remarkable courage and persistence, women were not given the right to vote (as they had hoped) when slaves were freed. The Fifteenth Amendment was enacted in 1870 and affirmed not only the “right of citizens” to vote, but declared that this right “shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” Only adult males were given the right to vote by this Amendment. Similarly, Presidents Harry Truman, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton all failed to secure passage of a national health insurance due to organized opposition from medical providers and insurance companies. President Barack Obama got past these opponents by making major concessions to some of them when he and congressional Democrats enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. LO 2-4 In many other cases, however, contextual factors contain a combination of opposing and supportive elements so that policy advocates can be successful. With respect to women’s suffrage, for example, feminists changed the context by using nonviolent forms of protest prior to World War I and then getting President Woodrow Wilson to support women’s suffrage by hinging their support for the World War I on his solemn promise to support their cause. With this more favorable context, they secured enactment of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1920 that gave women the right to vote. Policy advocates throughout American history had to engage in these policy-advocacy tasks to get policy reforms in place. By observing how policy advocates in prior eras engaged in them, we can better understand how contemporary policy advocates get social reforms enacted—and how we, too, might undertake them to get social reforms enacted when we determine that existing policies are ethically flawed. Who Engaged—and Engages—in Policy Practice and Policy Advocacy? Many kinds of persons have engaged in policy practice and policy advocacy in prior historical eras, and currently engage in them in the contemporary period. Elected public officials create public policies in local, state, and federal governments. They include heads of government like mayors, governors, and presidents who often assume a leadership role in developing social policies because they are expected to propose specific policies, as well as budgets to fund them. They often resort to use of the media in the modern period to increase public support for their policy proposals. Legislators enact statutes or laws that establish social programs, regulations, and civil rights laws—and must approve the budgets that are submitted to them by heads of government, usually after making many modifications to them. High-level members of government agencies in local, state, and federal governments are not only charged with the implementation of many policies but often develop policy proposals that are considered by legislatures as well as heads of government. These high-level members include political appointees (persons at the highest levels of government agencies appointed by the head of government) and civil servants (who receive their positions by taking competitive exams and interviews). Because elected public officials appoint civil servants to top government posts and oversee the agencies in the executive branch of government, they have considerable power over policies that shape the implementation of public programs, such as administrative guidelines that spell out operational policies not contained in legislation. Executives and staff associated with the operations of public programs can also influence social policy. Assume, for example, that a child welfare worker in a public agency observes a flaw in her program, such as failure to address the mental health needs of some children in foster care. She could call this flaw to the attention of her supervisor in hopes that this would lead to changes in high-level policies of the child welfare agency itself. If this strategy did not work, she would have other options, such as reaching another high-level official in the agency. She might contact an advocacy group for children, asking them to analyze the issue. If no other strategy worked or was feasible, she could become a whistle-blower by informing a higher level government agency or funder of the problem. Not-for-profit agencies have been a prominent feature of the American welfare state. Partly because many Americans did not like government, they often turned to not-for-profit agencies to provide health, children’s, counseling, and many other kinds of services. Their boards, directors, and staff have often been policy advocates. They can support or oppose specific propositions on the ballot, register voters, and make policy proposals to heads of state and to legislators. Their staff can lobby public officials to enact specific policies. They can educate voters about a specific issue. Just like government agencies, they establish many policies to determine how a specific program is implemented. (When a government agency contracts with them to implement a publicly funded program, they must heed those public policies that have been established for that program.) The boards, directors, and staff of for-profit agencies—which must pay property and income taxes, unlike not-for-profit agencies—have also participated in policy deliberations in the United States even if they are sometimes accused of seeking policies that advance their financial interests. Many persons wrongly assume that only high-level government and agency officials can engage in policy practice and policy advocacy. In fact, line staff and their supervisors assume critical policy roles in both public and private sectors. They identify flaws internally to their agencies, such as regarding gaps, omissions, or errors in the way particular programs are implemented—and use this information to change agency policies. They can identify unmet needs in their communities—and use this information to broaden existing agency programs to address them or to propose new ones. They identify informal policies in their organizations that impede their programs, such as disinclination among staff to serve a specific kind of client or to omit important services when helping clients. They advocate information exchanges within and among agency staff to help them better implement specific policies. They can work to develop partnerships with other agencies. Leaders and staff of advocacy groups , as well as volunteers that help advocacy groups, have frequently engaged in policy practice and policy advocacy in historical eras and the contemporary period—such as ones formed to end slavery, to end the use of child labor, to foster civil rights in the 1960s, and to bring more humane treatment of female prisoners (and their children) in the contemporary period. Examples in the contemporary period include the National Coalition Against Homelessness, the Mental Health Association, and the Children’s Defense Fund. Unions often engage in policy advocacy, including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) before it joined the American Federation of Labor (AFL) to become the AFL-CIO, and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) that currently represents many workers in public social service agencies as well as some not-for-profit and for-profit ones. Many organizations have been established at local, state, and federal levels to represent specific kinds of providers , such as not-for-profit providers of daycare services, subsidized housing programs, and child welfare agencies (like the Child Welfare League of America). Consumers engage in policy advocacy when they seek improvements in policies and services. They may complain, for example, to elected officials about the services they received in a publicly funded hospital or mental health program—complaints that may lead to changes in policies of these organizations. Or they may seek changes by talking with staff and administrators. Or they may testify at legislative hearings about the inadequacy of specific programs. Clergy and members of churches, synagogues, and temples , as well as organizations that represent them, have often been policy advocates. As one example, the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), a Quaker organization, has often championed the rights of prisoners and immigrants. Coalitions , formed to pool efforts of organizations and individuals, often mobilize resources behind a specific reform cause. Some of them are bipartisan such as a coalition that contained conservatives and liberals who are united in attacking the “overcriminalization of America.” They agreed that the United States has roughly 2.2 million inmates or more than any other nation (Alex Altman, “Kock brother teams up with liberals on criminal justice reform,” Time , January 29, 2015). Professionals often engage in policy advocacy as illustrated by such American social workers as Jane Addams, Bertha Reynolds, Whitney Young, and (in the contemporary period) U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow. The Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers requires social workers to engage in policy advocacy to advance the ethical principle of social justice. Use Ethical Reasoning to Decide What Is Wrong and What Is Right EP 1b EP 2c Policy advocates in each historical era, as well as in contemporary society, engaged in ethical reasoning as they decided what policy reforms were needed—because this determination was the starting point for their work. Examples abound in each historical era, such as: Quakers who sought to end slavery in the colonial period Dorothea Dix, who wanted to take mentally ill persons out of poorhouses Abolitionists who also wanted to end slavery in the 1850s Reformers who established the Freedman’s Bureau during the Civil War to assist freed slaves and who got the Congress to enact a series of civil rights bills Persons who fought for such regulations in the progressive era as requiring factories to conform to just-enacted fire codes LO 2-5 Advocates who established work-relief programs for millions of unemployed Americans in the Great Depression Civil rights activists who sought civil rights statutes in state and federal legislators in the 1950s and 1960s Women who fought for parity in wages with men in the 1970s Reformers who fought budget cuts proposed by the Reagan administration in the 1980s Children’s reformers who sought subsidized child care in the 1990s Activists who worked to strengthen provisions in treaties that protect workers in developing nations from insufficient wages, unsafe working conditions, and use of child labor in the 1990s Supporters of national health coverage in 2009 and 2010, as well as in 2017 and 2018. Policy advocates not only decided what was wrong —they also decided what was right when they chose to defend some policies that were under attack. In such conservative periods as World War II, the 1950s, the 1980s, and the presidency of George W. Bush, many policy advocates fought: Proposed funding cuts in many domestic programs such as deep cuts in Medicaid proposed by the Trump Administration in 2017 Proposals to convert entitlements such as Medicaid—which are automatically funded to the level of claimed benefits each year—into programs funded by the general government budget, making them more susceptible to cuts Proposals to privatize such government programs as Medicare and Social Security by asking people to develop their own medical and pension accounts Proposals to cut taxes so markedly that funding of the American welfare state would be jeopardized Proposals to rescind specific civil rights statutes or to dilute them Much like policy advocates in different historical eras, then, we engage in ethical reasoning as we read about the American welfare state’s evolution— and we then use ethical reasoning skills that we have developed when learning in contemporary America and that we will yet develop in coming decades. When confronting specific policies, social workers must answer the elemental question, “What is wrong and what is right?” Only after they have answered this question can they decide whether to engage in policy advocacy. In turn, they can answer this question only by engaging in ethical reasoning since only it allows them to reach moral conclusions. Possibly the most important reason for studying social welfare history is to enhance our ability to engage in ethical reasoning as we examine specific social needs and problems in historical eras and then decide whether ordinary people and public officials addressed them in ethical—or unethical—ways. We ask such questions as: Should private individuals, agencies, or public officials have chosen alternative policies? Did practical resources and technical realities preclude a different policy response? Did private individuals, agencies, or public officials wrongly rescind a meritorious social policy? When we engage in ethical reasoning, we often use words like right, wrong, duty , and obligation . We commonly engage in ethical reasoning in three ways: An outcomes approach , often called utilitarian ethics, in which we determine if a specific policy (or the lack of a policy) actually harmed a specific group of people by not addressing or aggravating their social needs A first-ethical principles approach , in which we determine if a specific policy (or the lack of a policy) violated an ethical principle that most of us hold in common, like “not killing,” “honesty,” “confidentiality,” and “preserving self-determination” A relativist approach , in which we determine if a specific policy (or the lack of a policy) is consonant with the norms or culture of the nation during a specific period or the political interests of ourselves or a group that we favor Determine the Ethical Merit of Speciﬁc Policies with Reference to Outcomes When using the first of our three approaches to ethical reasoning, we examine the relative ethical merit of a specific policy—or the absence of a policy—with respect to outcomes . (The branch of philosophy that uses this approach to ethical reasoning is called utilitarianism.) * When evaluating the ethical merit of a specific social policy, for example, we ask if it: Improves the well-being of its beneficiaries— often called client or consumer positive outcomes Not only improves the well-being of its beneficiaries, but does so at a reasonable cost— often called cost-effectiveness outcomes Provides other benefits to the nation—such as helping persons avoid having to join welfare rolls, making persons more likely to join the labor force, and improving the educational performance of children (it is impeded if they are hungry at school)—and if these benefits to the nation exceed the overall costs to the nation (often called cost–benefit outcomes, measuring if overall benefits exceed overall costs) We often possess data that help us decide when specific policies improve people’s well-being or provide other benefits to the nation—whether when evaluating policies in specific historical eras or in the contemporary period. When the Congressional Budget Office predicted that a version of health care that would replace the Affordable Care Act written by House Republicans in 2017 would cause 23 million Americans to lose health insurance, many social workers contacted elected officials to urge its defeat. The absence or insufficiency of data ought not suggest, however, that we cannot engage in ethical reasoning when examining social policies in LO 2-6 historical eras or in contemporary society. We can make informed judgments about outcomes of programs in many cases. We can use the best theory that exists to reach plausible conclusions. We can decide when certain policies violate specific ethical principles. Using SNAP to Illustrate Ethical Reasoning with Respect to Outcomes SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program formerly known as the Food Stamps Program, is currently a significant part of America’s safety net, but does it improve the well-being of its beneficiaries, do so at a reasonable cost, and provide other benefits to the nation? To see if it improves the well-being of its beneficiaries, we would search existing research on the program to answer questions such as these: Does it decrease the incidence of malnutrition in those children and adults who use it? Does it improve the quality of the food that they consume? Does it improve the economic well-being of its beneficiaries by “freeing up” income they would otherwise have to use to purchase food? Does the program also produce less tangible but important outcomes, such as reducing stress among low-income families who do not have to worry about meeting their basic nutritional needs—and does this yield better family and personal functioning and mental health outcomes? To see if SNAP achieves its benefits at a reasonable cost, we would examine how much it costs, per person per year, to provide free or subsidized food to its beneficiaries. If it cost $20,000 per person per year to provide its benefits, for example, we would readily conclude that it was not cost effective. (In fact, the program costs taxpayers far less per person per year.) To determine if SNAP also provides other benefits to society that more than offset its cost to taxpayers, we could examine existing research to see if any data exist with respect to such benefits. By giving working poor persons free or low-cost food, will they be less likely to need to resort to welfare? Does the program improve the health of its beneficiaries sufficiently that they are less likely to use publicly subsidized medical programs like Medicaid or use emergency rooms? Does the program increase the economic well-being of farmers by enlarging domestic markets for their products—as well as grocery stores? If we obtained affirmative evidence with respect to the outcomes, cost- effectiveness, and cost–benefit outcomes of SNAP, we would conclude that it is an ethically meritorious program. We might reach this conclusion if we found affirmative evidence with respect to only one or two of these outcome measures. If we could not find data that measured these kinds of outcomes, we could still declare it to be ethically meritorious based upon our best guesses about its effects—even if, in the best of worlds, we would like definitive evidence. When we have definitive evidence, we call a social policy an “evidence- based policy.” When we lack definitive evidence but can make a strong theoretical case for likely positive outcomes for a policy, we can use the term “likely evidence-based policy”—hoping that researchers will soon accumulate data that will demonstrate that a policy is an evidence-based one. Considerable evidence suggests that SNAP is effective and efficient. It provides debit cards for over 47 million persons in roughly 23 million low- income households, including families with children, seniors, workers, and disabled persons. It provides food assistance to more than 50% of eligible persons. It boosts the economy by injecting resources into low-income households. Error rates, whether overpayments or underpayments, occur only in roughly 3% of families. SNAP (D. Rosenbaum, 2013; “SNAP is Effective and Efficient,” Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , March 11, 2013). SNAP benefits average roughly $1.50 per meal (Go to www.fns.usda.gov/snap/ for eligibility levels. SNAP has bipartisan support. Regarding past historical eras, we must often make informed guesses about outcomes associated with a specific social policy because we lack definitive data. Take the example of so-called poorhouses or workhouses, where destitute persons were commonly placed during the 19th and well into the 20th centuries. We do not know with certainty what effect residency in a workhouse had on its recipients because data were not systematically collected, but we can hypothesize that these harsh and demeaning places conferred many negative effects on those who lived there. While residents received bare sustenance as well as lodging, they were provided with no job training to help them find employment. They received no assistance with personal problems (such as alcoholism or depression) that might have been the cause of their not finding work. They were treated as guilty persons whose presumed defects of character (such as laziness) had led them to seek assistance, even when their unemployment was due to labor-market realities such as recessions or depressions. We can hypothesize that workhouses might have caused some persons to revert to homelessness rather than suffer the indignity of residing there—and homelessness could possibly have led to health problems from exposure to the elements. When using an outcomes approach, then, we determine the relative ethical merit of specific social programs or policies by ascertaining if they lead to: Positive program outcomes as shown by evaluative research, whether using effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, or cost–benefit approaches Probable positive outcomes, as judged on the basis of our knowledge of human behavior and economics Probable negative outcomes, as judged on the basis of our knowledge of human behavior and economics Negative program outcomes as shown by evaluative research whether using effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, or cost–benefit approaches. Determine the Ethical Merit of Speciﬁc Policies by Using First Ethical Principles While it is very useful to examine the outcomes of policies to determine their ethical merits, this approach can lead to flawed conclusions in certain situations. Assume that the aforementioned Tuskegee experiment, in which African Americans with syphilis were deliberately not treated so that researchers could study the unchecked course of the disease, had enhanced medical knowledge about the disease and had increased medical knowledge sufficiently to allow physicians to treat other victims of the disease more effectively. From a purely outcomes perspective, we might have concluded it to be ethical. Yet all of us would agree that the Tuskegee experiment was ethically flawed even under these assumptions—and we reach this conclusion not with reference to outcomes, but by using first ethical principles in an approach to ethical reasoning called deontology. Deontologists contend that ethical principles should take precedence over outcomes even when the latter are successful. But how do deontologists derive these ethical principles? Some consult the precepts of major religions or religious writings such as the Qur’an or Bible. Still others contend, as did the philosopher Immanuel Kant, that society simply could not function unless its members adhered to such ethical principles as being honest and not killing. * If people feared on a daily basis that someone would attack them or that physicians, pharmacies, professors, and family members would frequently give them false information, they would be forced to lead reclusive or defensive lives. First-order ethical principles include: Honesty (the right to correct and accurate information) LO 2-7 Freedom (the right to hold and express personal opinions; the right to vote in free elections) Self-determination (the right of persons to make their own decisions about important choices of life, such as whether to use specific kinds of medical and social services, where to live, and where to go to school) Confidence-keeping or confidentiality (the right of persons to have personal and important information only divulged to persons whom they designated) Not killing (the right to stay alive) Due process (the right to procedural safeguards when accused of wrongdoing or denied benefits) Fairness (the right of persons to receive rights, basic necessities, and opportunities as other persons when they have followed specific societal norms like working—or when circumstances beyond their control, like mental and physical challenges, intrude) Social justice (the right of members of vulnerable populations not to experience flagrant inequalities in civil rights, resources, life conditions, and access to opportunities) First ethical principles are highly useful. By using them, we reject the Tuskegee experiment as unethical on the grounds that it violated the first principles of honesty, self determination, and not killing. We reject public lynching of African Americans in the South with respect to the ethical principle of not killing, fairness, and due process. We criticize the failure to provide all citizens with health insurance as violating the ethical norms of fairness and social justice in contemporary society. The ethical principles of “fairness” and “social justice” deserve additional explanation. I define “fairness” as requiring that persons who “play by the rules of the game” receive rights, basic necessities, and opportunities that are not flagrantly discrepant from other persons. Working women should receive similar wages to working men when they perform the same level or kind of work—and they should be promoted when they perform their work at similar levels as men. Ex-prisoners who do not engage in criminal behavior and who work hard ought to be accorded rights, necessities, and opportunities equivalent to persons who do not possess criminal records. Persons with physical challenges ought not to be discriminated against in job or housing markets—and, indeed, should be given workplace and housing accommodations to allow them to surmount barriers imposed by their physical conditions. Persons who work in relatively unskilled positions should receive wages sufficient for them to lead a decent life. Yet extensive data suggest that the ethical principle of fairness is often breached in contemporary society with respect to working women, ex-prisoners, and persons with physical challenges. In the case of single heads of households, usually women, their wages, health benefits, and childcare are often so low that they must work multiple jobs simply to survive. Ex-prisoners suffer extraordinary discrimination in job markets—often leading them to become homeless. An extraordinary percentage of persons with physical challenges live under poverty levels since they cannot find work— or obtain workplace accommodations. If the ethical principle of fairness requires society to treat all persons who play by the rules equitably, the ethical principle of social justice requires society to provide members of vulnerable populations with rights, life conditions, resources, and opportunities that are not flagrantly discrepant from the mainstream population. (I discuss social justice in more detail later in this chapter.) Ethical reasoning by using first ethical principles allows us to be relatively certain that we do not reach ethical conclusions that diverge from widely accepted ethical norms. Yet reasoning from first principles also has shortcomings. We sometimes disagree about how to define specific ethical principles since they are relatively general in nature. Indeed, courts have wrestled with how to define “due process,” “fairness,” “confidentiality,” social justice,” and “self-determination” in many cases. When ethical principles conflict with one another, moreover, we find it difficult to make ethical choices. Consider, for example, the ethics of euthanasia, which is the taking of life of persons by prescribing or giving them lethal drugs when they are diagnosed as terminally ill and when they request them. The ethical principle of self-determination suggests that physicians should prescribe or even administer legal doses of drugs when patients want them. Yet the ethical principle of not killing suggests that physicians should not honor such requests. When ethical principles collide, as in the case of euthanasia, it sometimes is not clear what choice ethical persons should make, since they must somehow prioritize one of them or find a compromise solution that balances competing ethical principles. Analyze How Culture, Self-Interest, and Politics Shape Ethical Reasoning Some philosophers criticize both utilitarians and deontologists, arguing that most people make ethical choices not through an extended process of ethical reasoning but by resorting to norms that they derive from their particular culture. When people in the colonial period placed wrongdoers on public display, they accepted a widely held norm that such punishment was morally acceptable. When people in the 19th century placed destitute persons in workhouses rather than giving them welfare assistance in their homes, they believed they were acting ethically; most contemporary Americans would cringe at this policy. Philosophers are often called relativists , who emphasize how culture in specific historical eras powerfully shapes perceptions of what is “right” and what is “wrong.” Some relativists also contend that ethical choices are often shaped by self- interest and by politics. Take the case of social workers who support expanded funding for mental health programs. While they take this position partly to advance the well-being of persons with mental conditions, they also realize that the enhanced funding provides employment to the members of their profession. Feminists and persons of color sometimes support affirmative action because they realize that members of their groups will benefit from this social policy. Were we to contend that self-interested choices were immoral, we would wrongly call into question an array of meritorious policies. Relativism usefully advances our knowledge about the way people often make ethical choices, but it has its own shortcomings. Absent any first- order principles or any consideration of outcomes, ethical choices would have no parameters. We could even justify slavery in America prior to the Civil War on the grounds that it was consonant with the culture of the South LO 2-8 —and would find it difficult to argue with Southerners who supported it because it helped the Southern economy. Explore Practical Considerations and Ethical Choices Our choices may also be shaped by practical considerations , such as the availability of resources or political calculations. We may decide not to contest a social policy that we believe is unethical because we think that it is not politically feasible to change it. We sometimes decide not to propose a policy reform because we think that insufficient resources exist to implement it. We must take account of practical considerations when making moral judgments about policies that existed in specific historical periods. Persons in some eras lacked knowledge or resources to imagine or implement policy options we take for granted in contemporary society. In the colonial era and the 19th century, for example, local, state, and federal governments possessed scant resources since the United States was a developing nation, much like many developing nations in the contemporary world. Government agencies lacked the ability to implement large-scale social programs like Medicare even if they had had the resources for them. It was not even legally certain that the federal government could implement large programs until well into the 1930s. We also need to recognize, too, that American culture has markedly changed over time, so that people in some eras may not have been able even to imagine some ethical options that contemporary Americans favor. Yet practical considerations ought not to impede us from making ethical judgments about social policies in specific historical eras or in the contemporary period. Even when we decide that specific policy proposals are impractical, we can often revise them so that they are feasible, that is, are less costly or more acceptable. We risk becoming opportunists with no moral foundation if we focus excessively on practical considerations when making moral judgments about social policies. LO 2-9 Use an Eclectic Approach to Ethical Reasoning EP 1a Whether examining ethical issues in contemporary society or making ethical judgments about policy choices in historical eras, we should ask a variety of questions that reflect all of the philosophical schools considered here (see Box 2.1 ). Box 2.1. Some Sensitizing Approaches for Evaluating Social Policies Some Considerations Drawn from Deontologists Identify first-order principles that are relevant to an ethical dilemma and decide, on balance, which choices or actions best satisfy them When first-order principles conflict—that is, point to different choices—seek a compromise solution that satisfies each to some degree Some Considerations Drawn from Utilitarians LO 2-10 Conduct research to identify the likely consequences of specific options or actions (or, when data are lacking, use knowledge about human behavior to infer the likely effects of specific policies) Select the option or choice that maximizes positive consequences for society or for one (or more) of its subunits Some Considerations Drawn from Relativists Analyze cultural factors that shape the ethical choices of people in specific historical periods, as well as other factors, such as institutional and fiscal realities Analyze how the interests of people—including ourselves—shape policy choices Practical Considerations Consider the practical implications of specific policies, such as their political feasibility and their cost, as well as administrative aspects We should consider first-order principles that have obtained a wide following in Western societies. Even when we subscribe to first-order principles, we often cannot rigidly follow their dictates without examining some possible consequences of a specific course of action. Finally, relativists usefully note that most people do not make ethical choices in an extended process of deliberations; rather, they tend to rely on the norms and traditions of their society or their specific community, as well as their personal interests. Ethical reasoning, then, forces us to consider many kinds of information when making ethical choices. It requires us to integrate or synthesize the information during a process of reasoning . In this process, we look for points of convergence and divergence. If deontology and utilitarian perspectives converge to suggest that a specific course of action or a specific policy choice is more meritorious than others, we can be fairly certain about our resulting decision. If these different considerations lead us in diverging paths—that is, suggest different actions or choices—we have to devote time and thought to seeking some resolution. Perhaps we will decide to give priority to one of the perspectives, or perhaps we will seek a compromise solution that draws on a range of considerations. Whatever our ultimate choice, we engage in a process of ethical analysis as we use a variety of considerations to decide whether a policy is (or was) meritorious (see Insert 2.2 ). Insert 2.2. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: The Case of Abortion The Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling (1973), which prohibits states from banning abortions prior to the third trimester of pregnancy, illustrates the joining of different ethical considerations. The court found first-order principles of not killing (the fetus) and self- determination (for the pregnant woman) to be relevant to the case. It also considered the fact that many women, when denied abortions, obtained illegal ones under dubious medical circumstances, and sometimes died or suffered serious injury as a result (a utilitarian consideration ). The court struck an ethical balance between the two first-order principles: it guaranteed that women’s self-determination would be prioritized in the first and second trimesters, while granting states the right to prioritize the not killing of fetuses in the third trimester. The justices paid attention to practical considerations when they acknowledged that it is not possible to prevent many women from seeking abortions, even if government wants to stop the practice. (Many women will seek illegal abortions.) This ruling illustrates, as well, how cultural norms shape our policy choices. Although many Americans still believed that abortions should never have been legalized in 1973, public opinion had shifted profoundly toward freedom of choice in the wake of the feminist movement of the 1960s and early 1970s, which emphasized women’s rights. Even a decade earlier than 1973, the court would probably not have made this ruling. Of course, if we prioritize women’s right to choose, we might criticize Supreme Court justices for not reaching a similar conclusion earlier, though our knowledge of the culture of the 1950s would help us understand why this was so. Whether or not we agree with the court’s decision, it reflects the balancing process that often occurs in ethical reasoning. In this case, several first-order principles are considered and balanced against one another. These principles, in turn, are balanced against utilitarian considerations, as well as practical considerations. Ethical reasoning is often influenced by the political and cultural context, as reflected by the growing importance of women’s rights in the early 1970s. At numerous places in this text, ethical issues are posed. No single right solution exists, since alternative resolutions are often possible. In each case, however, a deliberative process should be undertaken to weigh alternative resolutions and to work toward a preferred solution. The role of ideology in ethical reasoning about abortion became clear in April 2007, when the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of federal legislation banning so-called partial-birth abortions in the second trimester, in which the fetus is removed intact from the mother’s uterus. Most states had already banned this procedure compared with abortions in the first trimester—which constitute the vast majority of abortions—but they had mostly made an exception if the health of the mother was endangered were she to give birth. Most pro-life advocates, who opposed abortion, favored banning the procedure with no exception for the mother’s health, to the anger of pro-choice advocates, who favored giving the mother the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. In a 5-to-4 majority, the Supreme Court sided with pro-life advocates by arguing that states could ban partial-birth abortions even if a woman’s life was at risk. In his opinion for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy appeared to be establishing a legal argument for never removing a fetus from a woman’s uterus—possibly setting the stage for revocation of Roe v. Wade . This ruling appears to support ethical relativists’ contention that ideology often shapes ethical reasoning, since the appointment of conservative jurists to the Supreme Court by President George W. Bush in 2007 gave conservatives a narrow majority on the court shortly before the Supreme Court made this ruling. I discuss in the text additional court rulings, such as one in 2016 that struck down restrictions of choice by women early in their pregnancies in Arkansas and North Dakota. The controversy over abortion continued into the presidency of Barack Obama with respect to whether abortion would be covered by private insurance plans offered in each state under insurance exchanges in 2014 under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Congress had enacted the so-called Hyde Amendment decades earlier that banned Medicaid coverage of abortions. Pro-choice advocates agreed to drop coverage of abortion in Obama’s health plan to secure sufficient votes to enact it in the Congress. Pro-life advocates stepped up their efforts to enact legislation by states that would place specific restrictions on provision of abortion, such as requiring pregnant women to view ultrasound images of their fetuses before deciding to abort them (Oklahoma), banning of abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy on the disputed theory that fetuses feel pain by that date (Nebraska), and restrictions on coverage of abortion under insurance exchanges to be established by 2014 (Arizona). It was widely predicted that some of these state laws would eventually find their way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which would have to decide whether to uphold Roe v. Wade . The controversy over women’s right to choose continues today in the United States. For example, in March of 2013, North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple authorized legislation prohibiting abortion procedures once a fetal heartbeat is detected and disallowing abortion in cases of gender preference or genetic defects, like Down syndrome. This North Dakota law was declared unconstitutional by the U.S Supreme Court on January 25, 2016 by making clear that abortions are allowed until a fetus is viable around 23 or 24 weeks—and rejected one week earlier an Arkansas law that banned abortions at 12 weeks of pregnancy. Donald Trump made decisions as president that suggested that he opposed choice by women. He appointed Jeff Sessions as U.S. Attorney General and helped secure the appointment if Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court even though both men had opposed choice. He approved replacements of the Affordable Care Act that would have divested 23 million persons from coverage that including birth control at no additional cost and prenatal care. He supported ending funding of Planned Parenthood—and inaccurately described it as “an abortion factory, frankly” when most of its services help women with many health problems including breast cancer (“Donald Trump on reproductive freedom,” NRAL; Accessed at prochoeamereica.org ., 10/12/17.) Examine the Special Ethical Case of “Social Justice” EP 1a EP 3a EP 3b EP 5a EP 5b EP 8a We have discussed both outcomes and first-principle approaches to ethical reasoning when assessing the ethical merit of specific social policies—as well as relativist ethical perspectives. Now we use these ethical perspectives to examine social justice , which lies at the heart of the code of ethics that governs the practice of social workers. When discussing social justice, we often begin with a specific vulnerable population or out-group as our point of departure. We have many choices. The lower echelons of society constitute an economically vulnerable population or out-group, whose members are subject to class-based prejudice. African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native Americans are examples of racially vulnerable populations or out-groups, whose members have often been subject to racial prejudice. Certain groups, LO 2-11 notably women and older people, have often been kept out of the economic and social mainstream by virtue of the specialized roles ascribed to them; we can call these groups sociologically vulnerable populations or out- groups. As one example, women were traditionally expected to limit themselves to child-rearing and homemaking functions; indeed, middle- class married women did not enter the labor force in large numbers until World War II. Nonconformist vulnerable populations or out-groups include persons widely perceived to have different sexual orientations (e.g., gay men and lesbians), to have violated social norms (e.g., criminal offenders and juvenile delinquents), to possess stigmatizing social problems (e.g., those diagnosed with mental illness or persons with physical challenges), or persons who are homeless for extended periods. Widely perceived to be outside prevailing norms, members of these groups have often experienced discrimination. Some groups, such as Asian Americans, Jewish Americans, and certain white ethnic groups, have found it difficult to obtain assistance from policy makers because they are widely perceived to be problem-free, model vulnerable populations or out-groups. Although many members of these groups have made remarkable progress in entering the economic mainstream, this progress has tended to impede awareness of the major social problems that many of their members still experience. Many members of white ethnic groups lack health insurance, for example, just as many Asian Americans are poor, such as many Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrants. We can identify dependent vulnerable populations or out- groups, such as children, who occupy an unusual status. Generally lacking political clout, children depend on the goodwill of adults for requisite services, housing, and resources. Nonresident or migrating vulnerable populations or out-groups include persons who have recently come to the United States on a documented or legal basis and ones who are undocumented or have uncertain immigrant status. When discussing social justice, we usually compare a vulnerable population or out-group with a “mainstream population” (i.e., persons other than members of this specific vulnerable population or out-group). The mainstream group becomes a comparison group; white males or all males (in the case of women), whites (in the case of specific racial groups), relatively affluent whites or relatively affluent persons in general (in the case of low-income persons), persons who do not have physical or mental challenges (in the case of persons who possess these challenges), heterosexual persons (in the case of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer [LGBTQ] population), and persons who have not been incarcerated (in the case of persons who are in jail or who have been in jail). If we call each of these comparison groups a “mainstream population,” it becomes clear that multiple mainstream populations exist—and we select which one will be the comparison group when we examine the status of specific vulnerable populations. When we select a mainstream or comparison group that we compare with a specific vulnerable population, we want to know to what extent they differ from one another along one or several dimensions. We often compare them with respect to income, educational attainment, and other factors commonly associated with social class; relative access to health care, mental health services, and other services; relative access to educational enrichment programs; relative participation in the political process such as by voting; relative upward or downward mobility over long periods or during specific periods such as in recessions; relative health outcomes such as life expectancy and relative illness or morbidity; and relative mental health outcomes. We also compare a specific vulnerable population or out-group with a comparison group to determine whether they possess equal rights with respect to the right to vote, access to legal representation, filing of grievances, using public facilities, obtaining jobs, and gaining admittance or ownership of housing. By making these kinds of comparisons between a specific vulnerable population and the mainstream population, we ask whether specific vulnerable populations or out-groups differ from others in important ways (see Figure 2.2 ). When we discover differences, we often then engage in ethical reasoning to see if the differences are ethically acceptable or unacceptable. If we find them to be ethically questionable or unacceptable, we often label the differences as a violation of social justice . * We often find three specific kinds of differences between members of vulnerable populations and mainstream or comparison groups to be unethical: violations of civil rights, violations of life conditions , and violations of access to opportunities . In each case, members of specific vulnerable populations that experience these violations differ from mainstream populations. We use the three approaches to ethical reasoning to make this determination, whether an outcomes approach or a first-ethical principles approach. Figure 2.2. Details Kris Timken/Getty Images; Alison Wright/Corbis Documentary/Getty Images Income disparities in the United States. Social Injustice through the V iolation of Civil Rights of V ulnerable Populations Let’s begin with violation of civil rights, which were very commonplace until relatively recently in American history—and still exist today. To a degree that contemporary Americans can hardly comprehend, vast numbers of persons in the United States were not allowed to vote, use public accommodations, obtain jury trials, receive treatment from courts on a nondiscriminatory basis, obtain fair treatment from police, receive nondiscriminatory treatment at places of work (when seeking jobs, promotions, and equal pay), obtain access to housing on a nondiscriminatory basis, and gain access to hospitals and other health providers on a nondiscriminatory basis. Violation of civil rights can be declared unethical from an outcomes perspective. When vulnerable populations do not possess fundamental rights enjoyed by others, they are less likely to be productive, confident persons because they fear reprisals or unfair treatment from others—and these behaviors are harmful to the broader society and to themselves. Fearful persons are less likely to succeed in school, seek promising job openings, and move into integrated neighborhoods. Nor are violations of civil rights helpful to broader interests of American society, which needs contributions from all of its members in the economy, the arts, science, academics, and the professions. If significant groups of persons are systematically excluded from these areas, the entire nation’s economy suffers from this exclusion. Nor is flagrant violation of civil rights ethically acceptable from a first-ethical principle perspective since it violates ethical norms of due process, fairness, honesty, confidentiality, and, in some cases, not killing. When persons of color disproportionately receive death sentences compared with whites who committed similar crimes—and are executed in greater numbers—we can reject this policy as violating the first principles of not killing and fairness, not to mention due process. Philosophers with a relativist perspective correctly note that our views of what constitutes unacceptable violations of civil rights are powerfully shaped by culture and politics. Prior to the Civil War, for example, relatively few Americans believed that African Americans or women should vote—much less that they should be protected from discrimination in places of employment. Powerful political interests opposed the granting of civil rights to African Americans or women in this period, such as cotton- processing corporations in the North, plantation owners in the South, and sellers of liquor who feared that women would seek laws prohibiting the sale of their products if they could vote. Yet women obtained the vote by 1920—and the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965 gave persons of color the right to vote in the South and forbade discrimination against them or women. Political interests that had opposed the extension of these rights had long been eclipsed by economic and cultural changes in the nation. It is interesting to speculate what cultural or political factors in the early part of the 21st century will be viewed by Americans as similarly promoting flagrant violations of civil rights in another 50 or 100 years. (We examine some contemporary violations of civil rights in Chapter 13 .) Social Injustice through the V iolation of Life Conditions of V ulnerable Populations Violations of life conditions exist when members of vulnerable populations receive wages, pensions, health care, nutrition, housing, or other life amenities that are vastly inferior to a mainstream population. Such inequalities are most marked when members of vulnerable populations lack resources or services even to meet their basic survival needs compared with a mainstream population. They are also most marked when members of vulnerable populations are subject far more to uncertainties over these life conditions during recessions, sickness, unemployment, or other life vicissitudes—such as when women and persons of color are discontinued from employment when a recession occurs compared with white males, or when they lack sufficient resources when they retire to meet their basic needs. Even when members of specific vulnerable populations can meet their basic survival needs, however, they can still experience social injustice because it exists whenever large discrepancies exist in their life conditions compared with a mainstream population. While the Food Stamps Program, unemployment insurance, the EITC, and Medicaid have usefully expanded the resources of low-income persons in the United States and probably reduced the gap in resources between low-income and affluent persons, they have not fundamentally changed the huge gap in income between affluent and nonaffluent populations. Between 1970 and 2014, for example, the income gap between persons in the lowest fifth and the highest fifth of Americans has grown wider—despite the enlargement of many safety net programs. When examining inequalities in life conditions, we must also compare communities where vulnerable populations reside with those of mainstream populations. Many persons of color reside, for example, in crime-infested areas that make life hazardous on a daily basis. Due to discrimination in real estate as well as the inability of many persons of color to afford houses or apartments in more affluent communities, they are often subject to involuntary segregation in areas distant from many places of employment and lacking in good transportation systems, adequate grocery stores, and recreational facilities. The children of low-income persons of color receive their education mostly in segregated schools. These schools are often burdened with poor facilities and teachers than schools in more affluent areas. When children are segregated by both race and class because many middle-income persons of color have migrated to housing outside low-income areas, they do not see models of success in their communities or receive mentoring from persons who have attended college. When making these observations, we need to beware of suggesting that low-income persons of color in segregated communities are necessarily victims of dire circumstances. Many strengths exist in these communities, including churches, small businesses, neighborhood associations, and advocacy groups. Many persons surmount their environments. Some schools provide outstanding educational services in low-income and segregated communities. Yet data suggest that persons of color who live in segregated low-income areas must overcome barriers not encountered in more affluent areas. Discrepancies in life conditions are unethical when members of vulnerable populations experience negative outcomes compared with members of specific mainstream populations. Considerable evidence suggests that persons who suffer flagrant inequalities in life conditions—such as those that do not meet their survival needs—suffer health, mental health, education, unemployment, and other adverse repercussions. Persons who live in racially segregated, low-income communities often suffer substance abuse, juvenile delinquency, and poor educational outcomes. Huge inequalities in income between different social classes also yield negative societal outcomes. Research suggests that societies with large populations that are dependent on welfare and other public programs experience lower rates of economic growth than other nations. As persons in vulnerable populations with markedly lower rights, life conditions, or opportunities than other mainstream populations, they are likely to feel alienated —particularly as they follow widely supported societal norms like seeking employment and working hard. When alienation reaches a threshold, it inhibits proactive decision making, confidence, and formation of a positive self-image—and increases the likelihood of self-destructive behaviors. We have focused on persons of color in our discussion of inequalities in life conditions, but members of other vulnerable populations also suffer such extreme inequalities when compared with a specific mainstream population. Persons with serious mental and physical challenges suffer disproportionate poverty—that, in turn, contributes to their disabilities. Female single-heads of households are among the poorest members of our society—to the point that an academic coined the term, the feminization of poverty . Such women often work multiple jobs in a desperate effort to meet their children’s basic needs—which takes a toll on their mental and physical health, not to mention their ability to obtain further schooling that might allow them to obtain a higher-wage job. Persons who are released from prison often become homeless or soon return to prison because they are shunned by employers and receive scant help for their substance abuse and mental health problems. When LGBT persons observe that they are denied health and retirement benefits because they cannot marry—unlike heterosexual married persons—they are understandably resentful about this unequal treatment, which could even undermine their relationships (see Insert 2.3 ). Insert 2.3. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: “Do Not Ask, Do Not Tell” Discuss why the “do not ask, do not tell” policy of the U.S. military toward gay and lesbian military personnel was widely viewed to be ethically flawed. (It was rescinded by the Defense Department in 2011 in the wake of a ruling from a federal appeals court that barred further enforcement by the Department of Defense of its ban on openly gay members.) Many states did not allow same-sex marriages in 2013 even as 13 states had legalized them. The US Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriages, overturning bans on them in specific states. How do these developments illustrate that social change is possible even as discrimination against transgender people remains intact in school restrooms and the military in 2018? Do these high-level policy decisions eliminate discrimination in places of employment, schools and electoral office, suggesting the need for micro policy advocacy and mezzo policy advocacy? Social Injustice as Illustrated by Denial of Opportunities to V ulnerable Populations Violations of access to opportunities exist when members of specific vulnerable populations or out-groups get substantially inferior educational, health, job-training, transportation, child care, and preschool services compared with a mainstream population. If members of specific vulnerable populations lack access to these services beneath an acceptable threshold, many of them are condemned to unacceptable life conditions as they move through different stages of life. A low-income child from a racial minority group will find it difficult to better her condition if she cannot obtain quality education and health services, not to mention preschool services and child care. A person with physical challenges cannot expect to meet his survival needs if he lacks access to job training and technology—and if he is not mainstreamed into public schools. A woman who is denied access to science and math programs because of her gender finds her career choices circumscribed. Lack of provision of opportunities to vulnerable groups can be ethically attacked through an outcomes or utilitarian approach. Low-income persons of color, persons with mental and physical challenges, and ex-offenders who do not receive exemplary education and job training will likely possess lower income than persons who get access to these amenities. Their lower income at the point they receive relatively unskilled jobs will be compounded over the course of their lives by an inability to get promotions and to upgrade their career trajectories. They will be less likely to find jobs where employers fund health insurance and pensions, making them more likely to join the ranks of the medically uninsured and to be relatively poor when they retire. Society, too, bears substantial and unnecessary costs by not investing in opportunities for members of vulnerable populations. Such costs include unnecessary welfare costs for members of vulnerable populations who would have avoided welfare had they received better education, job training, medical care, and transportation. Some persons who serve time in prisons impose unnecessary additional prison costs on society when they are not given job training, substance abuse, medical, and other services when they are released from prison or when they are in prison. Persons with mental and physical challenges impose welfare, health, and other additional costs on society when they are not helped to enter and remain in the workforce or when they do not receive adequate assistance in their communities and homes. Persons who fail to enter the workforce or to upgrade their careers due to lack of education, vocational, job training, and other services pay far lower taxes than they would otherwise pay— depriving society of revenues it could use to fund other programs that invest in people and infrastructure. Social policies that create violations of access are unethical because they contradict the first ethical principle of fairness. Persons who work hard but who earn such low wages that they cannot afford preschool education, child care, education in junior colleges or colleges, vocational training, and transportation ought to receive subsidies from society to help them defray these costs that are self-funded by persons with greater resources but who often work no harder than low-wage earners—who often work multiple jobs just to make ends meet. They also violate the ethical principle of self- determination because persons who lack opportunities have fewer options or choices in life than a mainstream population that possesses them. Contrast an inner-city youth, who not only has not proceeded beyond high school, but who received such poor education in high school and prior levels of education that he remains illiterate, with a graduate of an excellent suburban secondary school system. If inner-city youth are far more likely to be limited to relatively unskilled and low-paying jobs, suburban white youth have more options that will almost certainly begin with a college education that will lead to many high-paying job options. Persons possess high levels of self-determination only when they have real choices in life — but the job, education, career, and other choices of many inner-city youth who are members of racial minority groups are relatively circumscribed compared with many suburban white youth (see Insert 2.4 ). Insert 2.4. Behavioral and Social Science Theories Underlying Policies Speculate how marginalizing of specific populations, such as low- income persons in an affluent nation, impacts their health, economic success, and self-image. Can you locate social science or human behavior theories in the text in your behavior class that discusses behavioral and social-psychological impacts of such marginalizing of persons and vulnerable populations? How might a social worker help marginalized persons and populations counter or surmount adverse effects of such marginalizing experiences? What personal and social factors allow many persons to overcome marginalizing experiences? The Challenge of Reducing Social Injustice over Time Gains in rights, life conditions, and opportunities for vulnerable populations should be celebrated, but they do not diminish social injustices if discrepancies between vulnerable populations and mainstream populations do not diminish over time. If, for example, educational attainment of relatively affluent persons improves at an equal, or even a greater, rate than low-income persons of color over a specific time span, discrepancies not only remain but may have increased over time. The problem of constant or increasing discrepancies between vulnerable and mainstream populations is one of the most vexing ethical problems in the United States. This is illustrated in Figure 2.3 and Table 2.1 . Data in Figure 2.3 , which shows data only to 2005, indicates that the income share of the wealthiest 1% of American households was the same in 2005 as it was in 1917 after dramatically declining from roughly 1941 to 1979. Data in Table 2.1 demonstrates that after-tax income for the top 1% of the population grew by 58%, 98.7%, and 61.8%, respectively, during the economic expansions of the Clinton presidency (1993–2000), George W. Bush presidency (2002–2007), and Obama presidency (2009–2010) as compared to only 20.3%, 6.8%, and 0.2%, respectively, during these time periods for the bottom 99% of the American population in these three presidencies. If overall growth of incomes of the top 1% was 58% during the full period from 1993 to 2010, overall growth of incomes for the bottom 99% was only 6.4%. Figure 2.3. Details SOURCE : Saez, E. (2009).

How would you respond to this question? Can we understand many of the persons that we help in social work without understanding inequality? Can social workers prioritize micro policy advocacy with members of vulnerable populations? Can social workers engage in policy practice and policy advocacy to advance social justice? Widening discrepancies may partly be due to the adage, “the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.” Affluent persons are able to improve their condition relative to poor persons because their affluence itself, independent of social policies, helps them obtain even better education, jobs, housing, and other amenities and opportunities over time. To offset this reality, Americans need to invest resources at an escalating rate over time—rather than at a stagnant or constant level. In fact, the United States has not invested increasing amounts of resources in many of its domestic child care, job training, substance abuse, and mental health services. This is illustrated in Figure 2.4 , which shows that federal investments in nonentitlement programs (infrastructure and domestic services) have stagnated since 1970. Figure 2.4. Details SOURCE: Silver, N. “Health Care Drives Increase in Government Spending.” New Y ork T imes (January 16, 2013), p. A16. Four kinds of federal expenditures, as a share of GDP, 1910–2010. Nor should we forget that the United States expends vast resources on affluent persons even as it funds safety net and other programs for members of vulnerable populations—expenditures that help affluent persons improve their well-being at an even faster rate than low-income, racial minority, and other vulnerable populations. These benefits and programs include tax deductions for mortgages, low taxes on stock dividends, low taxes on capital gains from investments, tax deferrals on funds placed in private pension accounts, and low taxes on estates. When coupled with resources that affluent persons already possess, these additional resources allow them to increase their wealth and amenities at a far greater level than would otherwise be possible. Analyze the Clash between Liberals and Conservatives over Social Justice Relatively liberal persons dislike discrepancies between vulnerable and mainstream populations for the reasons we have discussed, whether using an outcomes, first-ethical principle, or relativist perspective. Many conservatives are far less concerned about these discrepancies, however, because they believe that inequality produces positive outcomes and promotes specific values that they prioritize. They begin with the belief that members of some vulnerable populations often create their relatively low income by not prizing hard work to the extent of affluent persons. This tendency toward laziness is promoted, moreover, by those social polices that create “perverse incentives.” If low- income persons receive, for example, relatively generous benefits from such safety net programs as TANF and Food Stamps, they are more likely to believe they do not have to earn these resources. In turn, they often believe that inequalities between social classes increase the work incentive of relatively poor persons by making them realize that they have to work hard (or harder) to gain equivalent resources. Were society to be relatively egalitarian in its income distribution, these incentives would no longer exist or would be greatly reduced. Many conservatives, too, doubt that outcomes research demonstrates that inequalities in rights, life conditions, and opportunities yield negative outcomes for members of vulnerable populations or for the general society. They tend to believe that such research is flawed—and often conducted by relatively liberal persons who twist data to promote their desire to reduce inequalities. LO 2-12 Many conservatives, too, are usually unwilling to increase taxes to fund social policies that might reduce inequality among vulnerable populations. Relatively low taxes, they often contend, puts greater resources in the hands of relatively affluent persons who then use them to make investments that produce more jobs for Americans—including members of vulnerable populations. From the perspective of first ethical principles, conservatives often prioritize the ethical principle of freedom rather than fairness. Better not to encumber citizens with government programs or taxes, they contend, than to engage in “social engineering.” Liberals, in turn, question each of the conservatives’ assertions. The members of many vulnerable populations have relatively low income and other life conditions not because they do not wish to work, but because many jobs, such as relatively unskilled jobs, pay low wages. The vast majority of low-income persons, whatever their ethnicity or race or disability, work and work hard—often with multiple jobs. Far from increasing their desire to emulate relatively affluent persons, extreme inequality merely increases the alienation, anger, and stress of low-income persons. Existing welfare and safety net programs, liberals contend, do not create perverse incentives. With payments and benefits already pitched at relatively spartan levels, they do not induce persons to want to rely on them if they can find work that reimburses them sufficiently to meet their survival needs. Rather than assuming that members of vulnerable populations are intrinsically lazy, why not, liberals contend, view them as mostly adhering to American values of working hard and seeking upward mobility? Why not use affirmative strategies to better help them navigate education and job markets by giving them positive assistance rather than lowering their resources in hopes that this will induce them to work harder? Rather than viewing government and taxes as intrinsically evil, liberals view them as positive instruments for advancing important outcomes and first principles. People have to rely upon government and taxes, liberals contend, to decrease inequalities, advance other ethical principles, and improve outcomes. Debates between conservatives and liberals have frequently taken place in American social welfare history as we will see in many succeeding chapters. Nor are they likely to dissipate in coming decades, as our society has become (or remains) polarized by ideology and partisan politics. Debates between liberals and conservatives during the presidential campaigns of 2016 and in the Congress during the Trump administration illustrated polarization between the two major political parties. Consider social welfare history to provide a laboratory for deciding who is right and who is wrong at specific points in time and in the contemporary period. Analyze a Relativist View of Social Justice We have used an outcomes and first-ethical principle approach to social justice from both liberal and conservative perspectives, but cultural and political factors have powerfully shaped how Americans have responded to inequalities throughout their history. * In some eras, such as the Gilded Age in the last part of the 19th century and in contemporary America, Americans have been inclined to tolerate, or even to favor, wide gaps in income between relatively affluent and poor Americans. In the New Deal and Great Society, by contrast, more emphasis was placed upon diminishing large inequalities in income—or at least not favoring them. Even in the colonial era, such titans of American history as Thomas Jefferson favored a relatively egalitarian society of small landowners. In those periods when marked inequalities were tolerated or favored, such as in the period from 1980 to 2018, efforts to develop social policies to avert them faced greater opposition than in other eras. We will ask what kinds and thresholds of inequality were disliked, tolerated, or even favored in specific historical eras, by whom, and with what impacts on the selection of social policies. Political factors have powerfully shaped national responses to inequality in specific historical eras. In some periods when persons of color and women were disenfranchised, for example, political pressure to reduce inequality was markedly reduced. In periods when conservatives were in the political ascendancy, such as the Gilded Age, the 1920s, the 1980s, and the period from 2001 through 2018, efforts to reduce inequality were often relegated to the political backburner. We should realize, too, that our perspectives about specific kinds of inequalities can be influenced by religion, social status, and personal values —although generalizations are hazardous. If many affluent persons are disinclined to attack inequalities because they benefit from existing social and economic arrangements, some affluent persons do support policies to LO 2-13 redress specific kinds of inequality—such as when the wealthy father of Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, who objected to the demand of many conservative politicians that estate taxes be rescinded even on persons like himself. Billionaire Warren Buffet pleaded with Congress to raise his taxes that were, he contended, lower than the tax rate of his secretary. If some persons with fundamentalist Christian perspectives are relatively conservative in their ideology, many religious persons possess liberal or radical perspectives, such as the evangelical governor of Georgia who recently bucked his party fellow conservatives to seek higher state taxes to better fund the state’s educational system, which is widely viewed as among the worst in the nation. When studying the evolution of the American welfare state, we have to discern those political and cultural factors that influenced whether Americans in certain historical eras were troubled by specific inequalities. Curiously, such leaders as Thomas Jefferson in the colonial era were, for example, possibly more concerned about economic inequalities than many contemporary American leaders because they wanted to create a republic dominated by relatively small landowners who would (they hoped) possess relatively similar economic resources. In contemporary America, where wage disparities are vast and where a relatively small number of Americans own a large share of the nation’s assets and wealth, many leaders are relatively oblivious about economic inequality in the United States—even favoring specific tax policies that increase inequalities even further. Some Complexities in Thinking about Social Justice Our discussion to this point suggests that inequality is a multidimensional concept, since it involves rights, life conditions, and opportunities—and many vulnerable populations—and many mainstream populations against whom we compare specific vulnerable populations. So we have to select which dimension, which vulnerable population, and which mainstream population we are discussing rather than discussing equality or inequality generically. No matter which dimension or populations we select, reasonable people can differ about “how much inequality” represents a violation of social justice. Since it is seldom possible to have complete equality in life conditions or opportunities, we have to decide what constitutes “undesirable” levels of inequality—that is, the inequality threshold that makes us believe that social injustice exists. No simple solution exists—indeed, our choice about how low or how high to set the bar is, itself, an ethical one. If we condone economic inequality that consigns a vast portion of the American population to bare existence in a nation with unprecedented wealth, we risk setting the bar too low. (We can aspire to complete equality with respect to formal civil rights, but even rights guaranteed by law are only imperfectly implemented and enforced by government authorities. This is illustrated in contemporary America by the continuing sentencing of more persons of color to death as compared with white persons who commit similar crimes.) Magic bullets rarely exist when we wish to diminish inequalities. Take for example the gap in school performance between low-income persons and relatively affluent persons. Even were we to give low-income students educational services equal in every respect to ones received by more affluent persons, the gap in educational achievement between these populations would not suddenly disappear since many factors outside schools shape educational achievement. Researchers have discovered, for example, that prior to the first grade, low-income children often hear fewer words in their homes—and a smaller variety of words—than children of affluent parents. They have discovered, in turn, that this paucity of words powerfully shapes the educational achievement of low-income children compared with more affluent children. This sociological and linguistic factor could possibly be offset by emphasizing reading and language in preschool and child care programs used by low-income children, but even this remedy might not completely eradicate differences in educational performance based on social class. Affluent students bring other advantages to education compared with low-income students. They expect to go to college from an early age—and these expectations are repeatedly reinforced by teachers, parents, and friends; many low-income students, on the other hand, do not receive this reinforcement or even believe they will not complete high school. Yet many policy options do exist for redressing specific kinds of inequalities, such as: Civil rights laws and regulations Progressive taxation that makes relatively affluent persons pay higher taxes than less affluent persons Generous safety net programs like welfare, SNAP, SSI, and EITC Affirmative Action programs in colleges and employment Opportunity-enhancing policies in schools such as targeted enrichment programs Policies that allow low-income families to move to areas that are integrated by social class and race Policies to link low-income individuals with technology Navigate the Social W elfare State to Seek Reforms When we decide that existing social policies are morally flawed, we must decide whether to engage in policy advocacy, and, if so, where to focus our energies. When we navigate the American welfare state (Circle 2 in Figure 2.1 ), we work on three levels: Micro policy advocacy Mezzo policy advocacy Macro policy advocacy When engaging in micro policy advocacy, we make referrals , to link clients or consumers to specific services and benefits in the American welfare state. We can only make referrals intelligently and skillfully, however, if we understand the basic structure of the American welfare state. This understanding is enhanced by studying the evolution of the American welfare state when we learn which policy reforms were enacted in which time period and at what level of government. Our knowledge of social welfare history also allows us to understand what gaps and omissions exist in the American welfare state—allowing us to better understand predicaments encountered by consumers and clients. When engaging in micro policy advocacy, we help consumers and clients obtain benefits, rights, and services to which they are entitled—and to which they believe they have been denied. Denials occur for several reasons. Sometimes, persons are denied services and benefits in a timely way because of overburdened staff. Or staff may wrongly conclude LO 2-14 someone is not entitled to benefits or services due to their income or diagnoses. In yet other cases, persons may receive prejudicial treatment due to their membership of a specific vulnerable population based on their gender, race, or sexual orientation. Social workers who engage in case advocacy need to be versed in regulations and laws that determine consumers’ or clients’ rights. While personal intervention by social workers often suffices, they must sometimes help consumers or clients get legal counsel. In the case of mezzo policy advocacy , we work to change dysfunctional policies of social agencies and social programs. Mezzo policy advocates may seek, for example, to develop programs in specific agencies that are more responsive to clients’ needs, such as evening hours. Or they might develop a coalition in a neighborhood to eliminate a toxic waste dump. In the case of macro policy advocacy , we must decide whether to change policies in local, state, or federal jurisdictions. Do we focus on the private or the public sector? Do we focus on policies in a specific policy sector, such as health, mental health, child and family, civil rights, or safety net areas? Do we want to enact new legislation, change regulations that govern how a specific program is implemented, or find a public interest attorney to initiate litigation against an organization or official? Do we focus on policy changes in a specific organization or agency or a network of agencies? They also have to decide what kind of policy to change—choices that include constitutions, public policies, court decisions, budget and spending programs, rules, procedures, regulations, official policies, informal policies, and policies shaping implementing systems. And they have to decide what kinds of persons to include in their policy advocacy efforts, whether by enlisting them on their side or approaching them to make specific policy changes—persons that can include members of boards, directors, and staff of social agencies; leaders and members of advocacy groups; public elected officials; civil servants; members of organizations representing the providers of social services or benefits; and leaders or members of coalitions. Engaging in Policy Advocacy As we discuss in succeeding chapters, policy practitioners and policy advocates have often decided in prior historical eras and in the contemporary period that specific social policies are ethically defective— whether by their presence (an ill-considered policy) or by their absence (the failure of any policy to address an important issue). When they have made this decision, they can choose to be bystanders or policy advocates. Tens of thousands of persons have made the latter choice in the course of American history and in the contemporary period, resulting in myriad social reforms at many levels of government and in both the public and private sectors. Policy advocates engage in eight tasks at micro policy advocacy, mezzo policy advocacy, and macro policy advocacy levels. Deciding What Is Right and Wrong Policy advocates use ethical reasoning to determine whether they encounter conditions that call for action on ethical grounds as we have discussed in this chapter. Navigating Policy and Advocacy Systems Policy advocates have to determine where to focus and position their policy intervention, such as whether to seek changes at local, state, or federal levels; whether to seek changes in public policies or policies of specific organizations, or whether to help individuals and families gain access to social programs. Placing Issues on Policy Agendas Policy advocates had to gain the attention of key decision makers in the arena where they chose to be active. Persons who make decisions in any of the policy arenas that we have identified often have “full plates” of issues with which to contend, so policy advocates have to convince them to prioritize their issues. We shall discuss how policy advocates often succeeded in this goal in different historical eras, such as by deciding which of them would be most amenable to their issues, when to introduce them, how to build support for them, and how to gather evidence and data supporting them. Even when engaging micro policy advocacy, policy advocates have to decide which specific policy issues that confront specific clientsl Analyzing Problems Policy advocates also had to analyze those social problems or issues that concerned them in order to develop policy proposals to address them. They needed to ask: What political, fiscal, cultural, economic, and other factors led to a specific festering problem or issue? How serious or widespread was this problem or issue? What remedies currently exist for it—and why were they insufficient? What adverse consequences does the problem or issue pose for specific persons, communities, and society? Policy advocates have enhanced the trust of decision makers by developing and displaying their knowledge about a problem or issue. Reformers, legislators, and presidents developed proposals to address social problems from the inception of the republic to the present. When constructing legislation to address problems of unemployed persons, for example, legislators had to analyze the problem, such as deciding its causes and prevalence. As we shall see, they often decided that unemployment was caused by character “defects” of individuals, such as laziness—a perception that led, in turn, to punitive responses such as poorhouses or harsh welfare programs. Yet other reformers, such as the ones who secured the enactment of unemployment insurance in the 1930s, contended that unemployment was caused by economic factors such as recessions or depressions—a perception that led, in turn, to proposals to provide economic assistance to millions of Americans who lost their employment. It should be no surprise that Americans are more likely to implicate character defects when they are prejudiced against specific groups that they associate with specific problems. Equating poverty with Irish immigrants in the 1850s—a group that was greatly stigmatized by the dominant white Protestant population— many Americans favored punitive policies such as housing unemployed people of Irish extraction in poorhouses. Equating poverty with the mainstream population in the 1930s, when as many as 40% of the population was unemployed because of the Great Depression, Americans enacted less punitive policies such as work relief programs and unemployment insurance. When persons analyze problems, they also gauge their prevalence. In some cases, they underestimate the actual prevalence of specific social problems, such as when a legislator opposed federal funding for shelters for battered women in the 1980s on grounds that the problem had been invented by do- good social workers. In other cases, they may overstate the prevalence of a problem such as when temperance crusaders exaggerated the prevalence of alcoholism. How persons frame social problems influences the kinds of proposals that they develop to address them. To understand why Americans emphasized poorhouses in the 19th century, then, we must understand how they perceived poverty, as well as how they perceived specific victims of poverty such as Irish Americans or African Americans. To understand why federal legislators enacted the War on Poverty in the 1960s, we need to understand how they perceived poverty. To understand why Republicans and Bill Clinton approved welfare reform legislation in 1996, we need to understand how they perceived welfare. To understand why House Republicans opposed giving a tax credit to poor people while granting it to middle-class people in 2003, we need to understand why they opposed augmenting the income of working but poor Americans. Developing Proposals Policy advocates have needed to develop policy proposals to address the problem or issue that they have identified. They had to identify what benefits, services, or regulations their proposal would contain. They had to identify who would administer them, such as which level of government, the private or public sector, or some combination of these. They had to discuss who would be eligible for benefits or services and their content. Policy advocates also had to decide the cost of their social reform, as well as how to fund it. Would it be funded from annual general operating funds of local, state, or federal governments or by some combination of these governments? Would it be funded by earmarked taxes , such as payroll taxes or so-called sin taxes (on cigarettes or alcohol)? Would they be funded wholly or in part by consumer fees —and, if so, would all consumers pay these fees or would they be paid on a sliding fee scale? Would it be funded entirely or in part by the private sector? Would it be funded through so- called tax entitlements that give providers or persons tax incentives to fund specific social benefits, such as letting corporations write off their contributions to employees’ health insurance from their corporate taxes or letting many homeowners write off their mortgage interest payments from their personal income? Would it be funded by use of tax credits , such as allowing low-income households to receive a tax rebate from the Internal Revenue Service? Or would it be funded through some combination of these various strategies for funding specific social benefits? Policy advocates had to wrestle, as well, with sharing of responsibility across the public and private sectors. Perhaps they wanted public agencies to receive the funds for a specific initiative, but to have the power to contract with nongovernment agencies in implementing it. Or perhaps they wanted to give the private sector the primary implementing role, such as by giving corporations federal tax incentives to provide job-training services to welfare recipients. Or perhaps they wanted federal or state governments to carry exclusive responsibility for administering specific policies. In many instances, of course, different proposals were advanced to address specific social problems. If some reformers in the 1990s favored welfare reforms that emphasized the provision of remedial education, training, child care, and health care for impoverished single women and their families, other persons favored relatively punitive legislation that sought to force them from the rolls by establishing two-year limits on assistance while providing relatively negligible job training and child care assistance. Indeed, controversy is often endemic to social policy. Policy advocates had to engage in policy analysis even in micro policy advocacy. They asked why specific clients have not received benefits, services, and opportunities for which they were eligible. Getting Proposals Enacted Policy advocates could rarely take for granted that their policy proposal would be enacted by those decision makers that they had approached. They needed to develop and use power resources to persuade decision makers to take it seriously, such as by mobilizing pressure on them, finding key decision makers to endorse it, and testifying before legislative hearings. They sometimes developed coalitions to pool resources of different organizations and people to develop and implement political strategy. Policy advocates sometimes did not initiate new proposals but focused on preventing cuts in, or termination of, existing social policies—or blocking ill-considered proposals. Conservatives—usually with some support from liberals—have often been able to block social reforms by denying them resources: by cutting taxes, so as to deplete the funds available for social programs; by supporting costly ventures, such as military programs, that divert resources from the domestic agenda; and by seeking cuts in social programs in the annual appropriations process. At the same time, however, social reformers have often had considerable successes; as we know, a large proportion of the federal budget is devoted to domestic programs. Drawing on broad support from the public, reformers helped elect such liberal presidents as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Barack Obama, each having used the powers of office to enact hundreds of social reforms. Reformers have often built broad coalitions to support reforms. For example, in the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt drew together a coalition of persons of color, intellectuals, ethnic minorities, and trade unions. Civil rights and liberal religious groups obtained broad public support for civil rights legislation in the 1960s. By linking liberal groups and agricultural interests, reformers secured the passage of the former Food Stamps Program, as well as numerous expansions of it. Democrats, too, have often sought the allegiance of centrist or moderate voters. Witness Bill Clinton’s desire to co-opt many conservative themes, such as welfare reform, crime, and ending federal deficits, as a means of expanding the constituency of the Democratic Party. Just as conservatives have blocked reforms by appealing to popular beliefs —for example, the widespread belief that most welfare recipients cheat— liberals have often obtained public support for reforms by appealing to widely held values. Although many Americans do not want to help those they regard as undeserving—for example, those whose ill fortune can be linked to immoral behavior—they are generally sympathetic to the needs of those whom they see as innocent victims of adversity, such as unemployed people, persons with medical conditions, retirees who need pensions, widows, and children. Americans tend to like programs that equip people to find opportunities, such as educational and preschool programs. While Americans have often enacted punitive programs, they have shown their unwillingness to allow persons in poverty to starve by supporting a “safety net” that protects individuals’ basic needs. Americans have also supported laws that protect people from capricious discrimination in such areas as employment, housing, voting, access to courts and public facilities, and nursing homes. Liberals have had some surprising successes not just in passing laws but in securing funding for them in subsequent years. Such interest groups as the Child Welfare League of America, AARP, the National Association of Social Workers, and advocacy groups for special populations like persons with disabilities have lobbied legislators to fund social programs. In many cases, lobbyists have persuaded conservatives to support these policies by pointing out that many of their constituents benefit from such programs. Liberals have often made mistakes during prior historical eras. Take, for example, the construction of public housing buildings in concentrated locations, such as the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago. These homes did not provide a healthy living situation. Policy advocates have to develop strategies to help individuals when engaging in micro policy advocacy. Their clients may encounter discrimination from public and private agencies. Their clients may not be able to navigate complex bureaucracies. Their clients may not know how to gain access to specific programs. Getting Enacted Proposals Implemented Policy advocates have often discovered that they also could not take for granted that enacted policies would be well implemented. Meritorious policies sometimes come to naught, or are seriously compromised, by inept implementation. Perhaps agencies that implemented them failed to heed key provisions or even the overall goals of a policy reform. Perhaps insufficient funding existed for them. Perhaps resources were fraudulently siphoned off. Perhaps implementing staff lacked important skills. Perhaps agencies failed to collaborate with other agencies. As they observed these implementation deficiencies, policy advocates engaged in troubleshooting as they diagnosed and then sought to address them. They sought to persuade or pressure implementers to do better work, to secure greater resources for the proposal, or to seek new leadership. Micro policy advocates have to implement their strategy to help clients obtain services, rights, and opportunities. When helping students navigate urban school systems, for example, a micro policy advocate may combine mentoring, negotiating, and problem-solving as they work to help a student graduate from high school. Starting over Again, if Necessary Policy advocates should assess the effectiveness of implemented social policies. If they prove not to accomplish goals established for them by policy advocates, they should be improved or terminated—and policy advocates should propose policy alternatives. If they are successful, they should be continued and even expanded. Social welfare history demonstrates the need for policy assessment because we see both policy successes and failures. Many mental institutions became places to warehouse persons with mental problems from roughly 1880 to 1955. Yet safety-net programs such as SNAP and EITC have given necessary nutritional and economic assistance to tens of millions of low- income persons and families during the past 35 years. Successful policies can be called “evidence-based” ones. Looking to the Future While Americans have made considerable progress on some fronts, the American welfare state remains filled with gaps, omissions, and errors. The United States had greater income inequality than 20 other industrialized nations. Social welfare history demonstrates that important reforms have been—and can be—achieved in the United States, even when powerful constraints exist. It teaches us how we, too, can use ethical reasoning to identify these gaps, omissions, and errors. It shows us how we, too, can participate in projects to block efforts to cut or rescind programs, regulations, and funds for those elements of the American welfare state that advance such ethical goals as social justice. It shows us how we can engage in case advocacy and policy practice to make our society more humane— just like many reformers in prior eras.

Social Policy in a Developing Nation Introduction Colonial American was overwhelmingly rural in nature. Immigrants often owned small plots of land where they sold and bartered agricultural products. Aside from women, slaves, and Native Americans, it was a relatively egalitarian society. Americans came to view themselves as a unique nation that would be a model to the rest of the world, particularly after they had become independent from England. Y et this rural society not only enslaved persons forcibly imported from Africa, but pushed Native Americans off their ancestral lands. Nor were women granted many rights in this emerging nation. It had few social programs other than its poor laws. LO 3-1 LO 3-2 LO 3-3 LO 3-4 LO 3-5 LO 3-6 LO 3-7 LO 3-8 LO 3-9 Chapter 3.

At the end of this chapter, we will discuss what we can learn from the colonial period about policy advocacy, social policy, and the contemporary American welfare state. It was a diverse group of white settlers who came to the New World in the 17th and 18th centuries, predominantly from England but also in surprising numbers from Germany, the Netherlands, and Africa. In New England, Puritans and Protestants who were fleeing religious persecution in Europe wanted to establish spiritual communities based on their brand of Protestantism. Many Catholics came to Maryland to seek freedom from persecution in England. Large numbers of settlers hoped to better their economic condition in the New World, particularly as population growth in Europe had limited access to land acquisition and other economic opportunities. A large percentage of white immigrants became indentured servants in the hope that they could better their lot once their term of service was completed. Many slaves were brought forcibly to the New World from Africa, primarily to work on tobacco and cotton farms and plantations. Because these groups of people were so disparate and had such different motives for coming to the New World, it was unclear what ideas and institutions, much less what kinds of social policies, they would fashion —and how they would interact with the Native American population. 1789 George Washington elected to ﬁrst of two presidential terms 1791 Bill of Rights ratiﬁed as ﬁrst 10 amendments to the Constitution 1800 Thomas Jefferson elected to ﬁrst of two presidential terms Deeply influenced by European institutions and ideas, the colonists rapidly created a new society in the wilderness. By 1800, they had fashioned institutions and a political culture that differed dramatically from those in the European nations from which they had come. As we shall see, many constructive accomplishments, such as forming a new nation in the wilderness, were counterbalanced by the oppression of women, Native Americans, and Africans who were forced to migrate to America by slave traders. The colonists, moreover, often adopted a harshly moralistic attitude toward persons who genuinely needed economic help. Understand Feudal Inheritance During the decline of the Roman Empire after the 4th century, marauding bands of outlaws pillaged local villages and took land from local farmers in England and other European countries. Local populations gradually ceded title of their lands to powerful noblemen and monarchs, who allowed them to remain on the land but required them to render services in return for protection. By the 12th century, most of Europe had become splintered into a series of fiefdoms that had developed localized, hierarchical, communalistic, and traditional social institutions. * Medieval society was hierarchical. Land was held by monarchs, noblemen, and the Catholic Church. Noblemen paid taxes to monarchs and helped obtain recruits for their armies. In return for protection, rights, and assistance, serfs worked the land for noblemen, monarchs, and the Church, paid taxes to them, and gave them a share of the produce from the land. Citizens also paid mandatory taxes to the Church in return for its religious, social, and legal assistance. Medieval society was not capitalistic. Commodities were bartered in markets and in private transactions. Land was not bought and sold in the modern sense but was transferred through inheritance to successive generations of noblemen so that it remained within specific families for centuries. (Noblemen were forbidden to sell their property outside their families by prohibitions known as entail , which reflected the prominence of tradition and family.) Serfs were bound to the land; that is, they were required to work it. Although bound to the land, they also possessed rights to work specific amounts of land, which prevented noblemen from summarily evicting them; their children often inherited those rights. The serfs received no money for farming the land but could sometimes sell surplus goods in local farmers’ markets after coinage appeared. Some LO 3-1 pastures and woodlands were reserved for the common use of a village so that peasants could graze cattle in them and gather fuel. * Serfs did not live in dispersed housing but within small villages. Villagers elected members who negotiated with the nobleman’s representative (the bailiff) to decide which fields would lie fallow, who would tend animals in common pastures, and which members of the villages would serve in the king’s armies to meet the monarch’s manpower levy. The work ethic in the modern sense did not exist in this subsistence- oriented society. Serfs worked to meet basic obligations and subsistence needs—and no more. Numerous religious, seasonal, and traditional holidays were observed each year. Noblemen did not expect more than this minimal labor from serfs because they, too, were oriented to a subsistence and bartering economy. Little work was performed in the fall and winter owing to inclement weather. Though noblemen, crusaders, and traders accumulated vast wealth, the acquisition of wealth by exploiting market mechanisms—for example, charging interest on loaned money or raising the prices of food or commodities—was regarded with considerable suspicion. Early merchants who sought to accumulate money, or who tried to increase prices—and profits—by withholding grain from the market were often persecuted. Some medieval theorists even developed the notion that wealth should be shared, as it belonged to the society in which it was developed; however, this idea was not carried to the logical conclusion that society should take lands or resources from noblemen, the Church, or kings and redistribute them to serfs. Medieval society emphasized conformity with tradition. People were born into a position or status in society and usually remained within it. Rarely did people move their places of residence. Rights to the use of land as well as attendant obligations to noblemen were inherited. Persons who violated traditions—for example, those who failed to honor obligations or to maintain deference to social superiors—were subject not only to peer pressure but to various courts. Noblemen who tried to evict serfs from the land and serfs who refused to provide required service to noblemen were subject to sanctions. The Catholic Church was the only recognized church in the medieval period and was intimately associated with governmental institutions. It was, in effect, a government paralleling secular jurisdictions, with its own taxes, laws, and courts. In addition, many ecclesiastical officials served in secular government and in the monarch’s inner circle of counselors. Those who wished to establish a separate church—or to urge reforms in the existing one—met with strenuous persecution from church or government officials and were sometimes sentenced to death. Just as noblemen did, the Catholic Church used serfs to farm its vast amounts of land. (In England, King Henry VIII declared the English branch of the Catholic Church to be a state church in 1534 and succeeded in wresting control of it from the Vatican.) Go to the MindTap for this book to read more about the social and economic structure of medieval society that provided the context for immigrants to colonial America. This section discusses how the colonists often were influenced by ideas of persons who were rebelling against the hierarchy, monarchies, and state religions of medieval society as reflected in the writings of John Locke, Voltaire, and Adam Smith. They brought to America Protestant religions that rebelled against Catholicism, as reflected by the writings of Martin Luther in the Protestant Reformation. They also brought with them the Elizabethan Poor Law that was widely accepted in the American colonies as the way to deal with impoverished persons. Analyze the Colonists EP 5c EP 6a Historical research by Gordon Wood and Joyce Appleby emphasizes the extent to which the culture and institutions of the American colonists resembled those of European nations. * Indeed, American society in 1750 was similar in many respects to English society. By 1800, however, Americans had created a political culture and institutions that departed markedly from their counterparts in England; they had, indeed, founded a new society in the New World. To understand the evolution of American social policy in the colonial period and to obtain clues about its likely direction in the 19th century, we need to understand this process of transformation at the inception of the Republic. LO 3-2 Patterns of Continuity The earliest American settlers in the early part of the 17th century created communal, hierarchical, and regulated enclaves that conformed to older traditions. Settlers in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 17th century worked fields together, much as their feudal ancestors did, on land given to trading companies by the crown (see Insert 3.1 ). Insert 3.1. Critical Analysis: What Promoted the Mass Exodus from Europe? The fraying of feudal society promoted the emigration of large numbers of citizens from Europe to the American colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries. To understand the causes of this mass exodus, ponder the following questions: 1. In 14th-century medieval society, why would emigration have been difficult, even if citizens had access to ships? Consider how most people were bound to the land as serfs and unable to leave. Or how entrepreneurial activity was restricted to a relatively few merchants, so that incentive to colonize distant lands was limited. Or how, prior to the Protestant Reformation, relatively few people possessed a religious motive to flee European societies. Or how, absent strains of individualism that appeared during and after the Protestant Reformation, people lacked a worldview that promoted personal risk taking. 2. Consider how each of the factors associated with the fraying of feudalism contributed to emigration by providing motives, as well as people. More people now wanted to leave Europe, particularly the following groups: Descendants of serfs who became tenant farmers with uncertain economic futures Persons in growing towns who lacked steady work Persecuted members of Protestant sects In addition, population growth in Europe, as well as enclosures of land, limited people’s access to the land and also their economic opportunities. Finally, with the rise of crime and the appearance of vagabonds and class tensions, members of the upper orders now possessed a motive to force less prosperous individuals to leave England. 3. Consider, as well, how a demand for immigrants in the New World helped to promote a mass exodus. (We will see that many American landowners needed labor, thus providing a vast market for indentured servants, and how the huge tracts of frontier land beckoned some immigrants even in the colonial era.) 4. Now speculate why immigrants come to the United States in large numbers from many parts of the world. What similar, as well as different, causes for immigration exist in contemporary society? The farmers were expected to give a large share of their produce to the company in exchange for the right to work company lands. They lived in villages that were surrounded by company fields, rather than in the dispersed patterns characteristic of American agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries. Similar patterns were observed in the settlements in Virginia in the early 17th century. * The social structure in these earliest colonies was also hierarchical in the feudal sense. A few wealthy investors received rights to large tracts of land and were served by a landless class of indentured servants. A variety of artisans and craftsmen occupied an intermediary position in the social structure. As participation in the process of governance was conditioned on both holding land and meeting specific religious requirements, many persons were disenfranchised. Early life was tightly regulated. In Virginia, for example, each settler was required to plant a certain amount of corn to ensure adequate food crops. The colonists decided who could and who could not trap certain kinds of animals, where common pasturage would be located, the maximum levels of wages that could be paid, and the maximum prices that could be charged for specific products. Regulations were also promulgated that established apprenticeship requirements for entry into the various trades. * The individual colonies created official churches—Protestant churches in New England and a Church of England in Virginia. They also divided the countryside into parishes and imposed on all citizens, including those who worshipped in different churches, a tax to support the official church. Officials in these early churches, who were accorded extraordinary deference, often assumed roles in secular governance. Wood contends that the politics and culture of Americans in the different colonies mirrored England even in 1750, long after the earliest settlements —and that both the colonies and England retained many ideas and institutions from medieval Europe. Most English-speaking Americans, for example, remained loyal to the English monarchy. State religions still existed in many colonies. While not as well established or affluent as its English counterpart, an American aristocracy existed; this aristocracy was deeply prejudiced against ordinary people, from whom it demanded considerable deference. Like the royal court in England, this aristocracy freely obtained favors from legislatures and royal governors in the various colonies. Many colonies required parents to pass their land on to their oldest son or their children, rather than selling it. * Although people in England and America did not think in terms of social classes until well into the 19th century, they conceptualized society as a series of vertical ranks or titles, ascending from indentured servants and tenant farmers at the lowest ranks to a landed aristocracy at the top. Marked inequalities existed in England and America; at the lowest ranks, indentured servants, tenant farmers, and common laborers possessed scant resources and no land. Furthermore, between one-half and two-thirds of white immigrants in the 18th century entered indentured service before or after arriving in the colonies. (Evidence suggests that many who became indentured servants were driven from England, Scotland, and Wales as unemployment increased markedly during the 17th century, but a considerable number were also felons who were deported to the colonies. * ) Local courts provided protection for some indentured servants who were beaten or whose term of service, typically four to seven years years, was not honored by their masters, but their legal rights were not as complete as in England. Servants were beholden to their masters, who had paid their transportation costs to this country. Owners could try to extend the period of indentured service by appealing to local courts if their servants ran away, swore at them, or committed other petty offenses. Female indentured servants were often denied permission to marry because their masters feared the women would leave their service. * Indentured servants who had completed their terms often had difficulty finding an economic niche for themselves. Lacking funds to purchase land, many became tenant farmers and worked at low wages for landowners. Some became part of the relatively poor and landless population in the small cities of colonial America. Those who purchased land often had to go to relatively cheap land on the frontier, where they encountered danger from Native Americans. Those servants who chose to become apprentices in hopes of entering a trade had to serve an additional seven years as assistants to tradesmen and were often mistreated by their masters. * Although the early cities were small, the sizable numbers of unskilled and semiskilled persons who came to reside in them were subject to the numerous recessions that bedeviled the fragile American economy. In a credit-hungry economy, many Americans became overextended, could not pay debts, and were imprisoned. Produce was often plentiful, but grain exports to Europe were sometimes so great that shortages occurred in American cities. Consumer goods were often scarce in a nation that imported most of its manufactured goods. Nash argues that these urban, white, and landless people often became increasingly aware of differences in wealth, and thus the likelihood of urban unrest in hard times increased. * Riots were common in both England and the American colonies. Sometimes they were provoked by frustration at the slow workings of cumbersome bureaucracies. Periodic food shortages or rising prices of food prompted riots in local jurisdictions, even in the colonies. American squatters—people who inhabited land without having obtained legal title—often rioted to persuade local officials to give them titles or to allow them to purchase their land at reasonable fees. A series of nine major rebellions, each lasting a year or more, erupted in rural areas in the 17th and 18th centuries. These rebellions were waged by persons with a homestead ethic who believed that their land titles had been unfairly seized by trading companies or that their land was excessively taxed by legislatures. Thus, Bacon’s Rebellion in 17th-century Virginia involved a number of landless freedmen and indentured servants who protested against the monopoly of land by owners with vast holdings. * American colonists in 1750, then, had not developed a distinctive culture or set of political institutions. They often thought of themselves as Europeans rather than as occupying an independent status in the New World. English émigrés primarily read literature from England, conversed about English politics, and often intended to return to England once they had obtained sufficient funds. Patterns of Change Between 1750 and 1800, a dramatically new society was created (see Insert 3.1 ). To understand how this came about, we need to analyze the forces and events that powerfully transformed the American colonies. The first enclaves in the early 17th century were semifeudal in nature, with villages and state churches, but that pattern soon changed. Realizing that landless persons could settle freely on open land at the frontier, trading companies decided it was in their interests to sell land to immigrants, who eagerly bought what was offered. When governments were established in the different colonies, they also sold large amounts of land to individuals. Access to land was the most powerful transforming factor in the New World. While two-thirds of colonists owned land in 1750, only one-fifth of English citizens owned land. As they obtained property, many Americans came to perceive themselves not as common laborers, but as stakeholders in the emerging society. They increasingly demanded to participate in local and colonial politics; as landholders, they often were able to vote. They placed greater emphasis on work and initiative than landless people in England because they realized that their personal economic fate hinged on their ability to produce and sell crops and other commodities, such as candles or garments. The colonies lacked a large, landless, and destitute population, such as that existing in London and other English cities by 1750. This new society was a landed one, mostly composed of persons with holdings of between 90 and 160 acres. * Nor did these colonists live in the localized and static world that had existed in Europe for centuries. As indentured servants finished their terms of service, they often moved onto small plots of land at the frontier, where they were joined by new immigrants from Europe. As land became scarcer on the eastern seaboard, they moved to new areas. In a relatively brief period, huge areas of Pennsylvania, New York State, and the Carolinas became flooded with immigrants. The dynamic and changing nature of this new society was fostered not only by mobility but by population growth owing to the relatively high birthrate and to continuing immigration. The white population in the colonies practically doubled every 20 years, increasing from 1 to 2 million between 1750 and 1770 and from 2 to 4 million from 1770 to 1790. In a society with such mobility, the semifeudal norms and traditions of the early colonies quickly eroded. Many observers noted that frontier people were a raucous lot; they were often violent, they lacked government institutions, and they possessed a fierce individualism. Maintenance of an official church became increasingly problematic in the various colonies. America soon became a sanctuary for numerous Protestant sects who, despite various “toleration acts” in England, were still subject to widespread persecution; their children were excluded from English universities, their suffrage was subjected to numerous restrictions, and they were forced to tithe to the Church of England. As members of the various sects became representatives in local and colonial government, they urged separation of church and state and termination of the requirement in a number of colonies that citizens pay taxes to support the state church. Separation of church and state, which was made explicit in the Constitution, was inevitable in a country with so many religious sects. Although England was the birthplace of capitalism and its attendant class of merchants, many English people, especially the landed aristocrats, still viewed capitalism with suspicion. Americans came to embrace it with a fervor and a completeness unknown to the English. In 1750, American society was still largely rural, with only 5% of the population living in cities. However, most Americans were small capitalists on their farms, where they labored to produce crops and commodities for export to Europe, which provided a vast market during a period of rapid population growth. Although factories had hardly emerged in the New World, many farmers supplemented their income by producing a wide array of goods—including hats, candles, clothing, and tools—in their homes and barns. * Economic historians have documented that white colonists lived in a society with a high level of economic equality because most of them owned small plots of land with the exceptions of a relatively small class of aristocrats at the top and slaves, Native Americans, and many women at the bottom, as well as relatively few poor whites such as indentured servants. The conflicts of colonial politics further eroded the communal and hierarchical nature of the early settlements. Settlers in the western sections of the colonies demanded funds for a militia to protect them from Native Americans and for the construction of roads and other improvements. These demands were often resisted by easterners, and intense competition for limited public funds ensued. Many colonists soon came to oppose the royal governors appointed by the crown who, they believed, sought to advance the trade and financial interests of the monarchy by exploiting them—for example, by taxing them excessively; by demanding excessive exportation of agricultural products, even at the risk of food shortages; by forbidding them from establishing manufacturing that would compete with English goods; and by demanding that trade with England be transmitted in English ships. Conflict also increased between ordinary people and the American aristocracy. Unlike the long-established and wealthy aristocracy of England, American aristocrats tended to be self-made men who lacked lineage to centuries of noblemen. They were poorer than their English counterparts; few had huge houses and manorial estates. Lacking the trappings of the English aristocracy and enveloped in a society where most people owned land, they commanded less respect from Americans than did the English aristocracy from the English. Analyze the American Revolution as a Catalyst EP 3a An array of economic, social, and religious factors were antithetical to the hierarchy, social controls, and deference that the American colonists brought with them from Europe, but the colonists had not yet decisively overthrown the old order, even if they constantly squabbled with royal governors of the colonies, chafed at various taxes and regulations that the Crown imposed on them, and established legislatures or assemblies in the various colonies. According to historian Gordon Wood, the American Revolution was the catalyst that moved Americans to define their differences from the Old World and to forge a distinctive set of institutions. * What were the events leading up to the Revolution? King George was worried about the costs incurred by the Crown in seeking to protect the colonies from Native Americans. Partly to offset these costs, the Crown exacted new taxes on a wide range of goods. Already resentful of the various controls and taxes that the Crown imposed on the colonies, many colonial leaders were outraged by this new burden. Many colonists were familiar with the arguments of English parliamentary leaders who had sought to eclipse the power of the monarchy for decades and had obtained from it many concessions that increased the power of the Parliament. Some of these leaders even wanted to end the monarchy in favor of a republic. Drawing on the arguments of these parliamentary leaders, colonial leaders like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison LO 3-3 developed a rationale for making the colonies independent from the Crown; these efforts culminated in the Declaration of Independence of 1776. The demand for independence and the associated attack on the monarchy drew a wide and favorable response because large numbers of colonists, ensconced on their own plots of land and wanting to participate more fully in their own governance, had no wish to return to an old regime that might rescind their economic and political gains. The imposition of taxes on their goods by the Crown in the 1760s was a symbol of a different (and English) society that was not consonant with the New World. Were they to relent to the Crown, might they endanger not merely their political right to resist taxes imposed on them in London but their landholding, entrepreneurial, and individualistic culture? Might not those American aristocrats who still fancied themselves as possessing the prerogatives of English aristocrats try to repress the political freedom and power that ordinary people were obtaining in the New World? When viewed narrowly, the American Revolution was simply a rebellion against an overreaching Crown that insisted on its right to impose taxes without consulting the colonies’ elected assemblies. When viewed more broadly, however, the Revolution was the catalyst for colonists to define their new society in terms markedly different from the customs of the Old World. * When King George agreed to rescind only some of his new taxes and when he did not honor the Americans’ insistence on independence, war ensued; it lasted seven years. By the time the American Revolution had ended, about one-tenth of white males had joined the militia. The sheer length of the conflict dramatized the formal separation from England and encouraged widespread acceptance of a new ideology of republicanism that deemphasized hierarchy, lauded individualism, favored the toil of ordinary people, and sought democracy. The battle against the Crown was supplemented, moreover, by intensive conflict within the colonies. Many Loyalists (or Tories), often drawn from the ranks of the large landowners and the aristocratic class, did not participate in the Revolution; some resettled in Canada and elsewhere. Although it fostered widespread acceptance of an ideology that extolled individualism, the leveling of distinctions between people, and freedom, the American Revolution may be contrasted to the French or Russian Revolutions, in which social classes were pitted against one another and revolutionaries sought to redistribute wealth. A host of research strongly suggests that the American Revolution, though accompanied by a surge in idealism and sacrifice, had relatively limited effects on social reform. It did not help obtain legal parity for women, to provide just treatment to Native Americans, to end slavery, or to reduce the marked inequality between social classes. * Our purpose is not to question the legitimacy of the colonial grievances but merely to underscore their limited and focused nature, which did not include the grist of true revolutions: the questioning of social relations within a society and between its social classes. As most Americans possessed land, no large class of landless and urbanized people existed (as in the French Revolution), and no large class of landless peasants existed (as in the Russian Revolution). These American revolutionaries fought both for independence and to establish a society grounded on individualism and freedom, but not to effect dramatic changes in the nation’s social structure. The achievement of independence enhanced the self-image of the colonists, who had managed to outwit and outduel a major world power. They confidently believed they could create a utopia of yeoman farmers by embracing capitalism and democratic institutions. Europeans such as Locke, by contrast, knew that their ideas could be only partially realized in societies encumbered by centuries of tradition as well as by classes and institutions that resisted change. As Commager put it, the Europeans imagined the Enlightenment while the Americans created it. * It is fitting that land ownership figured prominently in the ideology of colonial leaders like Thomas Jefferson. We have noted how the widespread ownership of land promoted individualism and a leveling of class distinctions. The importance that colonial leaders attached to land ownership is illustrated by a portion of a letter that Jefferson wrote to James Madison in 1785 during a visit to France. In the letter, Jefferson contrasted social conditions in France and in the colonies: The property of this country is absolutely so centered in a very few hands, having revenues of from half a million of guineas a year downwards. These employ the flower of the country as servants, some of them having as many as 200 domestics, not labouring. They employ also a great number of manufacturers, and tradesmen, and lastly the class of labouring husbandmen. But after all these comes the most numerous of all the classes, that is, the poor who cannot find work. I asked myself what could be the reason that so many should be permitted to beg who are willing to work, in a country where there is very considerable proportion of uncultivated lands? … The earth is given as common stock for man to labour and live on … it is too soon yet in our country to say that every man who cannot find employment but who can find uncultivated land, shall be at liberty to cultivate it, paying a moderate rent. But it is not too soon to provide by every possible means that as few as possible shall be without a little portion of land. The small landowners are the most precious part of a state. * From Revolution to Limited Government If the Revolution brought independence and the rejection of many ideas and institutions drawn from England, it also ushered in an era of limited government, in which the federal government’s responsibility for social policy would be stifled. When they finally achieved their independence in 1783, the Americans confronted a dilemma. If the 13 colonies became separate nations, they would confront many problems. Trade would be difficult with 13 separate currencies. They could not easily fashion treaties with foreign nations that had designs on frontier lands—especially Spain, France, and England—if they lacked a common foreign policy and navy. They could not easily fend off Native Americans on the frontier without a shared militia. Nor could they easily plan and build roads and canals across their boundaries if they remained independent. At the same time, each of the colonies jealously guarded its prerogatives; none wanted to yield excessive authority to a central government that might usurp its freedom in a manner akin to King George and the English Parliament. They turned to the difficult task of constructing a Constitution in 1787. Meeting in Philadelphia, 55 delegates from all states except Rhode Island commenced their work in May and approved a document in September. It became the law of the land in June 1788, when the ninth colony, New Hampshire, ratified it. Although they realized that they needed their government to have some powers, the framers of the Constitution were also obsessed with the dangers of an oppressive central government. To avoid this possibility, they created a complex system of checks and balances, including a popularly elected House of Representatives, senators elected by legislatures in their states, a president elected by an electoral college rather than by direct election, and an independent judiciary. To further circumscribe the federal government, the framers enumerated its specific powers; the list included the right to issue currency, to form a militia, and to make treaties. (Furthermore, as we note subsequently, they specifically reserved to the states all powers not given to the federal government when they added the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution as part of the Bill of Rights.) * The Constitution had momentous implications for the development of social policies in the new Republic. By not enumerating social policy as one of the federal government’s powers, the framers intended that it fall entirely within the province of state and local government. Until well into the 20th century, many presidents and legislators, as well as justices, assumed that it was unconstitutional for the Congress to enact social policies. Because the founders realized that the government would need to evolve to meet the changing needs of the nation, they inserted four provisions that eventually provided a legal rationale for the development of federal social policy: 1. They gave the federal government the power to regulate interstate commerce, which was used in the 20th century to regulate the working conditions of workers whose companies shipped goods to other states. 2. They included a clause that allowed the federal government to enact laws that furthered the nation’s “general welfare.” This ill-defined clause was later used by social reformers to justify a range of social interventions. 3. The founders stipulated that the federal government could “make all laws that shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the fore going [enumerated] powers.” Like the general welfare clause, this phrase was sufficiently vague to justify a broad range of legislation. 4. By allowing the Constitution to be amended, the founders provided a mechanism for change. Constitutional amendments protected the rights of African Americans and other groups in the wake of the Civil War. As originally written, however, the Constitution must be viewed as retarding the development of federal social programs because it did not mention social welfare policies and appeared to restrict the federal government to specific and relatively limited powers (see Insert 3.2 ). By contrast, the French Constitution, which was written a few years later, outlawed slavery, guaranteed all citizens the right to work, urged humane care of the poor, and declared education to be a public obligation. * Moreover, as we discuss subsequently, the Constitution was both a sexist and a racist document severely limiting the rights of women and persons of color. Insert 3.2. Advancing Human Rights and Social and Economic Justice: The Omission of Social Policy from the Constitution Speculate why the framers did not discuss social policy in the Constitution. Consider such factors as: The absence, in a rural society with small towns, of the social problems that exist in an urbanized society The belief that the colonists were creating a society that would not have the major social problems that bedeviled Europe, such as poverty or other problems endemic to large cities like London The legacy of local Poor Law traditions and private philanthropy, which led the framers to assume that local institutions would suffice The widespread assumption that the federal government would possess relatively scant resources. While the Constitution empowered the federal government to “raise revenue,” many framers opposed the imposition of large federal taxes Discuss whether the framers’ failure to discuss social policy in the Constitution constitutes a violation of human rights and social and economic justice that assumed a role in delaying the enactment of major social welfare policies and programs by the federal government until the 1930s and the Great Depression. Can we excuse the framers’ failure by considering their culture as well as the resources available to the federal government in this era? Although the Constitution ceded considerable power to them, local and colonial governments were extraordinarily weak in the colonial era. It is true that they imposed taxes and regulations on local citizens and businesses (e.g., they often established prices and wages), required males to work a certain numbers of days on roads and other public improvements, and constructed many roads and bridges (sometimes with tolls). But these local governments existed in an environment that was not conducive to the development of major powers, as Greene makes clear: With only a tiny bureaucracy and no police, a localized judiciary system that rarely met more than fifteen to thirty days in any given year, and legislators that in peacetime were rarely in session for more than a month in any given year, government was small, intermittent, and inexpensive. Except during wartime, taxes were low, and the only public activities that engaged most men were infrequent militia or jury service and some more frequent participation in vital public works such as building and repairing bridges and roads … [W]hile they wanted enough government to secure peace and to maintain civil order, most Americans were … in favor of just so much government as will do justice, protect property, and defend the country. * Legitimating Limited Government The framers wanted to put strict limits on the power of the federal government, but they did not agree about how limited the new government would be. During the two terms of President George Washington, a heated battle developed between two factions led, respectively, by Thomas Jefferson, Washington’s secretary of state, and Alexander Hamilton, his secretary of the treasury. A self-made man with aristocratic inclinations, Hamilton wanted a relatively strong central government that would pursue mercantilist policies akin to the Crown. He wanted the federal government to invest resources in roads, canals, and bridges; to establish a national bank to oversee the economy; to fund promising new economic projects; to impose considerable taxes to fund these projects and pay off debts that remained from fighting the Revolutionary War; and to develop a strong navy and militia. Hamilton favored a relatively loose interpretation of the Constitution. While acknowledging that the Constitution mentioned only certain powers, Hamilton believed that it implied other powers, such as the power to establish a National Bank. By contrast, Jefferson favored a limited federal government; he supported “strict constructionism,” according to which the government would be limited to the powers enumerated in the Constitution. He wanted the American economy to center upon agriculture, opposed a National Bank on the grounds that it was not mentioned in the Constitution, opposed mercantilist policies, wanted low federal taxes, and opposed a standing army. * Jefferson’s view of a limited government was shared not merely by many federal legislators but by many people in the various states. So-called antifederalists had even sought to prevent ratification of the Constitution, which they believed conferred excessive powers on the federal government. Partly at their insistence, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution (the Bill of Rights) were added in 1791 to protect citizens’ rights from capricious actions of the federal government. Often caught between the forces of Jefferson and Hamilton, President Washington tried to define the powers of the central government; usually he sided with Hamilton. His patience was tested on many occasions. One such incident was the so-called Whiskey Rebellion. Needing funds to retire the national debt and to fund the government, the Congress enacted an excise tax on distilled liquor at Hamilton’s request. However, in western Pennsylvania, local insurgents questioned the federal government’s right to impose these taxes. This tax revolt was quelled only after Washington personally accompanied troops into Pennsylvania. * The battle between the Hamiltonians and the Jeffersonians persisted during Washington’s tenure and during the presidency of John Adams. Then, in 1800, Jefferson narrowly defeated Adams in a tumultuous presidential contest. In his two terms, Jefferson implemented his limited government vision; he sharply reduced expenditures and slashed taxes. Defeated by Jefferson, the federalists soon disappeared as a viable force. With few exceptions, all of the presidents of the 19th century subscribed to Jefferson’s views of limited government. As we shall see when discussing the Gilded Age in the decades after the Civil War, however, they frequently used federal resources and powers to help corporations and the railroads. Using Jefferson’s doctrine of strict constructionism, none of them supported the use of federal resources to fund major social programs other than war pensions. The Jeffersonian influence was so pervasive and long-lasting that it is not possible to understand modern American conservatives without placing them in the context of Jefferson’s ethos. Some readers may wonder why a text on social policy devotes so much time to distant constitutional developments and to these early disputes about federal power. However, this examination of the founders’ philosophies clarifies an important aspect of social policy in the United States: that a strong defense of the central government’s role in social welfare is relatively recent in American history. The U.S. federal government did not develop strong social-policy powers until the Great Depression of the 1930s —or almost 150 years after the Constitution was written. By contrast, in England and other European countries, extensive central government policy and regulatory roles existed even before the 18th century. Analyze Positive Responses to Social Need Americans inherited the same combination of positive and punitive social policies that existed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries, but they often did not enforce negative policies on the assumption that pauperism and even poverty would not become widespread in their land-owning utopia. Furthermore, most early settlers brought with them the tradition of regulation of local economic affairs that had been so pervasive in Europe. Strange as it seems to contemporary Americans, cities, counties, and colonial assemblies limited wages and prices, granted business licenses to merchants, controlled the exportation of grain and other commodities, and regulated the rights and obligations of indentured servants and apprentices. These various regulations did not necessarily benefit poor persons, as they could be devised in a manner that assisted those with wealth or those masters who had indentured or apprenticed labor. Nonetheless, colonists believed that government should assume a wide range of functions to further economic development and to assist persons in the lower economic strata. From England, the colonists also brought with them the mercantile tradition, which gave government major roles in promoting job development and economic growth through the building of roads and bridges and other capital improvement projects. The development of regulatory policies at the local and state levels must be regarded as a positive social welfare response to social and economic needs. * A tradition of private philanthropy developed with remarkable rapidity and often led to projects that were jointly funded by government and private donors. Benjamin Franklin participated in many partnerships between the public and private sectors—for example, the development of libraries, fire- fighting services, orphanages, and educational programs. The prevalence of Protestantism in the New World promoted the ethic of charitable giving. Wealth was often perceived by early Protestants as a mixed blessing; although it was the proper reward for a life of hard work, it could also LO 3-4 promote laziness, pride, and greed—traits that were viewed by many colonists as sinful. Donating to charity became a way of easing this guilt about material possessions. Many of the earliest Puritan settlers believed that good works were morally correct but could not in themselves influence the Lord to grant salvation; however, by the middle of the 18th century, a growing number of clergy and citizens believed that moral living could increase the likelihood of achieving salvation. The sermons of preachers of the Great Awakening, a grassroots movement to revitalize and personalize Protestant religion during the 18th century, denied that good works could merit salvation but emphasized the importance of benevolence as a sign that one was saved. * As in England, church parishes were a major source of charity. The Puritan churches of Massachusetts Bay, for example, elected officers whose major responsibility was to oversee sick and impoverished members of the congregation. Many American Protestants likened church organizations to extended families that cared for their members in times of adversity. * Officials in colonial and local governments also continued the tradition of the English Poor Law by requiring the election or appointment of officials in local parishes who would collect taxes to pay for poor relief. (The English Poor Law required local parishes to care for poor people.) Colonial assemblies were particularly generous in assisting persons who had been wounded or disabled in battles with Native Americans on the frontier. They often funded direct assistance to those individuals, without relying on local jurisdictions and without imposing the punitive policies that characterized other forms of assistance. Thomas Jefferson’s portrayal of assistance to the poor in Virginia in the 18th century underscores generosity to those persons perceived to be incapable of working, even though he notes that vagabonds were sometimes placed in workhouses: The poor, unable to support themselves, are maintained by an assessment on the tytheable persons in their parish. This assessment is levied and administered by twelve persons in each parish, called vestrymen, originally chosen by the housekeepers of the parish, but afterward filling vacancies in their own body by their own choice. These are usually the most discreet farmers, so distributed through their parish that every part of it may be under the immediate eye of some one of them. They are well acquainted with the details and economy of private life, and they find sufficient inducements to execute their charge well, in their philanthropy, in the approbation of their neighbours, and the distinction which that gives them. The poor who have neither property, friends, nor strength to labour, are boarded in the houses of good farmers, to whom a stipulated sum is annually paid. To those who are able to help themselves a little, or have friends from whom they derive some succours, inadequate however to their full maintenance, supplementary aids are given, which enable them to live comfortably in their own houses, or in the houses of their friends. Vagabonds, without visible property or vocation, are placed in workhouses, where they are well cloathed, fed, lodged, and made to labour. Nearly the same method of providing for the poor prevails through all our states; and from Savannah to Portsmouth you will seldom meet a beggar. * In some jurisdictions, such as Boston, widowed or divorced women with children successfully resisted the tendency to place all dependent persons in poorhouses and received outdoor relief. * Of course, these benign interpretations of the workings of Poor Law institutions were balanced by harsher interpretations, which we note later. Colonial courts also assumed a range of social welfare functions. Many children became orphans in colonial society because of their parents’ early deaths from plagues, accidents, and childbirth. Local courts oversaw the economic affairs of these orphans to ensure that they received funds granted to them by their deceased parents’ wills, which were often given in the form of proceeds over a period of years from the sale of livestock in the estate. * Early Americans often supported the development of policies to equalize opportunity precisely because they favored self-improvement. Americans emphasized some opportunity-enhancing policies even before the American Revolution, which expanded options for many citizens. Some favored universal and public education, though universal education was not developed until the 19th century. Suffrage was generally tied to a property qualification, but it was already granted to more persons than in England. Perhaps the largest social welfare program of the colonial period and the early republic, however, was land distribution. Although wealthy people bought large amounts of land in early Virginia, many smaller farmers were able to acquire land from the Crown, trading companies chartered by the Crown, and colonial governments. * Americans also developed private philanthropic institutions, which tended to support opportunity-enhancing educational, health, and self-help projects that reflected the new society’s preoccupation with self-improvement. Examine Punitive Policies Just as the English had done, many Americans viewed persons who were unemployed as undeserving and, hence, favored punitive treatment—in other words, indoor relief. In Massachusetts in 1780, vagabonds, paupers, and indentured servants were not granted the right to vote. The institution of the workhouse gained considerable popularity in colonial America. As early as 1688, for example, the House of Burgesses in Virginia recommended that every county build a workhouse. A frenzied period of construction occurred in New York State in the early and middle 18th century. Jurisdictions that lacked the funds to build workhouses adopted other punitive devices. A poor person or family could be auctioned to a low bidder who would take care of them in return for payments from local officials; a child could be placed as an indentured servant under a willing master; and persons without means could find themselves summarily escorted to the boundaries of a jurisdiction, as the American colonies had enacted laws of settlement similar to those in England. Americans also took a dim view of “moral crimes.” Many jurisdictions enacted laws prohibiting adultery and fornication, swearing, or even malicious gossiping. In colonial Virginia, persons found guilty of these crimes were generally made to devote a certain number of hours to public works—for example, the construction of a local bridge. Alcoholism was a major problem in the American colonies and sometimes led to imprisonment. Major crimes were similarly met with harsh treatment. Debtors were often imprisoned, even when they had no means of paying debts that were due to disability or health problems. As in England, capital punishment was extensively employed, sometimes even for petty theft, and executions were often public events attended by throngs of people. Social welfare institutions did not extend assistance to African Americans, who were defined to be outside the social compact; this policy prevented LO 3-5 slave owners from freeing their slaves when they could no longer work or were sick—actions that would have raised the Poor Law costs of local jurisdictions. Various colonies enacted laws that made slaves ineligible for assistance from Poor Law institutions and that forbade their owners from releasing them when they were ill or aged. * The settlers lived in a violent world. Most of them possessed firearms to hunt, to fend off Native Americans, and to obviate the creation of standing armies. They waged several major wars, fought Native Americans, engaged in various sectarian and sectional battles, fought in taverns, participated in various rural and urban riots, and witnessed public executions and lashings. * Examine the Oppression of V ulnerable Populations EP 1a EP 2a If the colonists were sometimes punitive or harsh in their treatment of white citizens, such as indigent people, they were often brutal in their treatment of women, Native Americans, and African slaves. LO 3-6 Oppression of W omen Contemporary historians have analyzed the lives of women in medieval society and concluded that, despite notable exceptions such as female royalty, they lived within relatively restrictive boundaries. Virtually without exception, people viewed both society and the family as hierarchies in medieval times—and the husband was seen as the superior member of the family, to which his wife and children were subordinate. Indeed, as Fraser notes, England was governed by feudal law “where a wife passed from the guardianship of her father to her husband [who] also stood in relation to her as a feudal lord.” As the subordinate party, women were expected to be obedient, to confine themselves to household duties (or, in pastoral areas, to those farming duties that were most related to the household, such as milking cows, making cheese, and making clothing). * It was widely assumed that women were “weaker vessels”—that is, inferior to males not just physically but also morally and intellectually. Prior to the 17th century in England, virtually no women were literate, and educational reformers in that century, who gave some women exposure to education, refrained from allowing them to learn subjects like Latin, a language essential in an era that emphasized classical studies. The economic roles of women were circumscribed. The guilds and crafts that developed to regulate skilled work in the towns and cities were dominated by men; women were excluded or, at best, allowed to be second- class members. Much of the work that women undertook—as domestic servants, small retailers, spinsters, or midwives—was not organized into guilds or crafts, and thus women were deprived of the kinds of security that guilds and crafts afforded. Though husbands and wives often worked together in the fields in feudal settings, the husbands generally passed the rights to farm strips of land to their sons; consequently, daughters lacked land rights. * Women had few legal protections in the medieval period. The Church of England provided wives some protections against cruelty, lack of support, and desertion. Divorce was not sanctioned, but women could petition the Church for separation; often, though, they made these petitions only after their husbands had left them. * Accustomed to hierarchy in Europe, the colonists also assigned authority in families and in society to men. Men concerned themselves with farming, business, politics, and professions, whereas women were relegated to domestic matters and the raising of children. Although, on occasion, a woman whose husband died might assume management of a business, women generally refrained from seeking expanded economic and social roles. * The Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution made no mention of women in their many passages. No one even thought to give women the right to vote. It was widely assumed that rights granted to persons in the Constitution applied only to males. It was no accident that the Declaration of Independence authored by Thomas Jefferson stated that “we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal …” Feminism, in the modern sense of the word, did not exist in colonial America, even among such articulate women as Abigail Adams, the wife of John Adams. Virtually no one considered the possibility that women might vote. The colonists developed elaborate codes of etiquette that defined patterns of deference among the various members of the family, in a hierarchy extending from the husband to the wife to the children. Women could own property and sign contracts when they were unmarried or widowed, but they did not usually retain property or sign contracts when married. Children were the legal property of husbands after marriages had been officially dissolved, even when the husband had been unfaithful or abusive. Women were not allowed to serve on juries. Except for the Quakers, Protestant sects did not allow women to assume major roles in church governance. Married women were not expected to work outside the home, although women in lower-income groups most likely had to earn money to survive in many cases. Already in the colonial period, the wages of working women, married or unmarried, were far less than those of men who undertook comparable work. Furthermore, the segregation of working women into poorly paid work—as small retailers, seamstresses, laundresses, and domestic servants, for example—suggested that the feminization of poverty, a term used in the contemporary period, had relevance to many women in urban areas in the colonial era. Women were excluded altogether from the professions of law and medicine. * Religious traditions encouraged colonists to believe that women were inferior to men. In medieval times, Catholic doctrine stressed that Eve had brought sin into the world by persuading Adam to eat the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. Though a number of thinkers in the Renaissance criticized the notion that women were morally or intellectually inferior to men, the Protestantism of the 17th century retained strong misogynist (sexist) tendencies, including the portrayal of women as seducers. However, Protestant sects did support minimal literacy for women so that they could read the Bible. * Although limited in their roles, women in the colonial period were probably not as restricted as women in the 19th century. The high mortality rate in colonial society meant that many women assumed responsibility for the trades or businesses of their deceased husbands. Because society desperately needed labor, women were able to enter some trades. Midwives delivered children. In agriculture, women not only helped their husbands run farms but also produced candles and cloth in a society that lacked manufacturing industries. Much like Mahatma Gandhi in 20th-century India, women made homespun cloth during the American Revolution to reduce dependence on English imports. However, we should not exaggerate the economic roles of women in colonial times; as Harris notes, they often assumed economic roles only after their husbands had died, and they performed them within the larger context of subordination. * The domestic burdens of women were also less onerous in the 18th century than in the 19th century because children generally entered trades at the age of 10 or 11. By the mid-19th century, however, children were increasingly seen as needing extended and intensive parenting, and women were required to devote a major portion of their lives to parenting and spousal responsibilities. Some evidence exists that the economic conditions of women deteriorated toward the end of the 18th century. One contributing factor was that husbands, who often died before their wives, began to leave most of their estates to their children. In addition, although outdoor relief for women who were single heads of households had prevailed in earlier periods, women who could not fend for themselves were increasingly forced into newly constructed poorhouses. Some jurisdictions did allow women entering marriage to construct settlements that retained their rights to the property that was already theirs. However, few women availed themselves of these settlements; in consequence, they lost control of their property, both within the marriage and when their husbands died, divorced, or left them. * Women suffered extraordinary hardship because no adequate method of birth control existed. In addition to abstinence and coitus interruptus, mostly herbal and other folk methods were used to prevent pregnancy; these were of dubious value. Moreover, because procreation was widely regarded as the ultimate purpose of marriage, few women used birth control at all, except to increase the interval between childbirths by means of abstinence. Women tended to marry in their early 20s and to have children every other year; a typical family might have seven children or more. It is estimated that as many as one in five women died during childbirth or from the toll of successive pregnancies. Moreover, many women were pregnant at the point of marriage—probably around 20% in some jurisdictions. * Women in the colonial period gained some benefit from certain Protestant beliefs. In particular, American Protestants’ strong belief that families should be “peaceable” and intact led them to support laws that granted divorces on grounds of desertion (the most common reason women sought divorce) and cruelty. (Most divorce petitions were initiated by men, but they were often rejected by local courts.) Laws existed in many colonies, as well, that forbade physical abuse of women and children and that punished rapists, although then (as now) many rapists escaped punishment by alleging that the woman had consented. * Oppression of Native Americans In medieval Europe, most people lived in relatively homogeneous societies of white persons and had little or no contact with persons of other races. As Sanders suggests, the idea of race was only “dim and sporadic” for most Europeans during the Middle Ages. * But race assumed fateful dimensions in the minds of many Europeans by the late 15th century, as explorers like Columbus made contact with native peoples in the Caribbean and in Central and South America—and as Europeans, desperate for labor , sought to import African slaves into these regions. Depicted in older history books as a heroic figure ( Figure 3.1 ), Columbus has been portrayed less flatteringly by modern historians. After a first voyage in 1492 that was primarily a trip of discovery, Columbus set sail on a second voyage—complete with 17 ships and 1,200 men—intending to colonize the New World. * When he discovered that a small settlement called Navidad, left from the first voyage, had been burned and its inhabitants murdered, Columbus’s dream of concord between the indigenous people and the Spanish ended. Dor-Ner suggests that Figure 3.1. Details Morphart Creation/ Shutterstock.com.com The clash of cultures in the New World. “the Navidad incident would set a pattern of violence and mistrust between Europeans and Native Americans that would be played out in blood as successive waves of Spanish, English, and French colonialists swept through the Americas … this poisonous attitude would in time … echo at the Little Big Horn, where Sitting Bull took no prisoners [and] would be brutally distilled in the infamous remark of General Philip Sheridan: “The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.” * Columbus and his Spanish successors quickly devised a method of controlling the indigenous people by placing them in a position akin to feudal serfs. Though indigenous people in their villages were allowed to keep their property, they were forced to give most of their produce to the conquerors in return for “protection.” Moreover, tens of thousands of them were conscripted for forced labor in mining and other endeavors. The pope and Queen Isabella of Spain often tried to place moral constraints on Columbus and other conquistadors, but they had scant success in stopping the brutalization of the indigenous population, despite the protests of a handful of courageous priests. The pillaging of native settlements in Central and South America soon followed the early forays into the Caribbean. Far more deadly to the indigenous people than the violence and servitude imposed on them by the conquerors were the diseases brought by the Europeans; they had no natural resistance to smallpox, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, the bubonic plague, typhoid fever, cholera, scarlet fever, and influenza and died by the millions from these various diseases. In Central Mexico, the native population declined from 11 million in 1519 to 2.5 million in 1597—a staggering loss that was repeated throughout Central and South America and in the Caribbean. * Medieval culture did not prepare the Europeans to resist exploitation of the native populations or to outlaw the use of slaves in the New World. As Christians, for example, the Europeans were prone to divide humankind into two groups: Christians and heathens. The Church had long held the notion that heathens could be placed in servitude once they had “rejected” Christianity; on this principle, the Crusades had sought to conquer Muslim peoples in the Middle East. Feudalism provided the notion that native villages could be controlled by recreating the feudal equivalent of serfdom; in the New World, far removed from the ancient protections that had provided some assistance to European serfs, the indigenous population and then the slaves could be exploited with little interference from European courts, the Church, or the Crown. Nor should we forget racism. Placed in contact with people of different racial backgrounds, the Europeans were quick to interpret differences in skin color and costume as signs of primitive, heathen, savage, and lazy dispositions (see Insert 3.3 ). As native peoples and slaves physically resisted exploitation, the Europeans could seize on this behavior as proof of their savagery. Nor did the Europeans develop racist ideas only during the conquest of the New World; they had long imagined that cannibalistic and savage people lived in undiscovered territories. * Insert 3.3. Behavioral and Social Science Theories Underlying Policies: Are Native Americans Part of the Human Species? EP 6a Thomas Jefferson was intrigued by the possible origins of Native Americans. Were they, he asked, a separate race from white settlers, or were they somehow linked to white settlers in their makeup? He and other colonists wondered, too, if slaves were different from white settlers in their psychological makeup, including their intelligence. These speculations were hardly confined to the colonial period, as we shall see in succeeding chapters. Some white Americans concluded in the late 19th century, for example, that persons of color were less intelligent than whites because they allegedly possessed smaller skulls. A best-selling book in 1994 by Richard Hernstein and Charles Murray ( The Bell-Shaped Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life: Free Press) contended that African Americans possessed lower intelligence than white Americans. Dr. Larry Summers, while president of Harvard University, alleged that women lacked the intrinsic ability to excel in mathematics compared with men. We now know that all human beings possess the same basic genetic makeup, due to advances in the science of genetics. We now know that our species had its origins in Africa due to archeological discoveries and genetic analysis. We now know that average skull size does not vary between subgroups of Homo sapiens. We now know that convincing scientific evidence does not exist to demonstrate that persons of color or women possess different levels of intelligence— even if we could agree how to define and measure “intelligence.” Discuss why theories of genetic and intellectual deficits or differences of specific subgroups of H. sapiens continue to arise in American history. To what extent do you think they underlie some contemporary social and educational policies? How might social, economic, and cultural factors sometimes make it seem plausible that differences in social and economic achievement between subgroups of H. sapiens are caused by genetic and intrinsic differences? How would you respond to someone who said, “African Americans have lower average income than white Americans because they are not as intelligent as them”? Or, “Women cannot understand mathematics as well as men because of intrinsically lower intelligence”? Might you wish to examine, as well, how persons of color and women fare in other cultures and nations, as well as how social, economic, and familial backgrounds might shape their lives? Historians’ early estimates placed the Native American population of North America (excluding Mexico) at only 1 million persons, but recent research suggests that, in fact, this area was densely populated by Native Americans, who numbered some 10 million persons in 1490, grouped into about 600 tribes. Every portion of North America was occupied. This huge and dispersed population—including coastal tribes on the Pacific and Atlantic, tribes inhabiting the forests east of the Mississippi, the Plains tribes that hunted buffalo, tribes that occupied the Rocky Mountains, and tribes that lived in the deserts of the southwestern and western portions of the continent—represented a major barrier for the white settlers because these tribes occupied the land, the most valuable resource in the New World. * The early colonists quickly encountered two groups of Native Americans: a string of tribes that occupied coastal areas from New England to Florida and a group of tribes that inhabited inland areas like the Appalachian Mountains. Colonists in the earliest settlements in Virginia and Massachusetts took the view that Native Americans in the coastal tribes could be converted to Christianity and, in the meantime, could help settlers by familiarizing them with native crops and hunting techniques. Early settlements in Massachusetts established “praying colonies,” where converted Native Americans lived as part of the community. The settlers were certain that the Native Americans would choose Western culture not only to gain salvation but also to obtain its technological benefits; how could they, the colonists reasoned, retain their nomadic, un-Christian, and primitive existence when offered the benefits of civilization and Christianity? * This expectation was naive on many counts. Native Americans valued their own culture, which differed markedly from the settlers’. Native Americans worshipped their own deities, did not collect or value property, led a nomadic life, and were content with a subsistence existence that required only as much work as was needed for survival. As the numbers of white settlers increased, it became obvious that Native American culture was endangered. Once they had given up feudal strip farming and communal property, many of the earliest settlers began to develop and enclose fields, much as the English landowners had done; this practice quickly depleted the Native Americans’ lands. If Native Americans resisted, colonists cited their violence as evidence that they were savages beyond any hope of conversion to Christianity. If they did not resist, the relentless expansion of white settlements continued unabated. The settlers also conducted their share of unprovoked violence—for example, because some group within their settlement enjoyed slaughtering Native Americans, because they were overcome with fear as they heard of other violence, or because they wished to retaliate for some earlier violence. Petty theft by a Native American led in one case to the massacre of an entire tribe. * As in the Caribbean, the spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera, and diphtheria was even more devastating to Native Americans than was warfare. As these diseases were wholly new to the Native Americans, they lacked biological resistance to them. By roughly 1675, the coastal tribes extending from New England to the Carolinas had been virtually eliminated; the few survivors pushed westward to join with still powerful inland tribes. The inland tribes in and around the Appalachian Mountains proved able to resist the white settlers until the mid-18th century. Their remarkable resilience was made possible by their geographic remoteness from the coastal settlements and by their ingenuity in developing alliances with the French and adapting their hunting practices to provide furs to the white settlers’ commercial markets. The white settlers could have agreed to permanently cede large portions of lands on the frontier to the Native Americans, but they did not do so for several reasons. England and the trading companies, which had established the white settlements in the first instance to provide raw materials and markets for the English mercantile system, supported continuing migration inland for furs and other commodities that could be used in England. Moreover, the colonists believed that land was created by God to be farmed and that forest and other unfarmed land occupied by nonfarming Native Americans was wasted land that should be given to (or taken by) the white settlers. * The settlers attempted to wrest the land from the Native Americans in a manner that would make their exploitation appear to be compatible with moral codes. They successfully used the seemingly legal device of the treaty. By this means, they created the impression that certain Native American tribes had voluntarily and legally ceded land to the colonists. Native Americans were made to sign under threat of coercion, while intoxicated, or in exchange for money or gifts. When the Native Americans stopped teaching their children to use bows, they could no longer obtain food without guns, and so white settlers could entice them to sign treaties by offering them guns and other commodities. To decrease their dependence on the settlers, one tribe tried to revive ancient hunting skills in the mid- 18th century, but few individuals had the patience to undergo the years of practice required to use arrows when guns were available. * However, the settlers were not so successful in obtaining lands from the inland tribes. Tribes in an area extending from New York State to the Ohio Valley joined in a common negotiating alliance; their shrewd bargaining led the British Crown to draw a line, known as the Proclamation Line of 1763, that separated settlers’ lands from Native Americans’ lands on the Western frontier. (The Crown was willing to make this concession to thwart alliances between the Native Americans and the French, who vigorously contested the English for possession of portions of the New World.) The Crown had difficulty enforcing this line, however, because individual settlers, trading companies, and colonies relentlessly sought lands beyond it. After the American Revolution, the Americans displayed far less resolve in enforcing the line than had the English. * Inland tribes such as the Iroquois in the North and the Cherokees in the South were doomed, however. As the frequency of their contact with white settlers increased, they proved as vulnerable to fatal diseases as their coastal counterparts had been. When they altered their hunting patterns to collect furs as a means of purchasing guns and other products they dispersed their tribal settlements and thus made them more vulnerable to attack. The white settlers soon employed treaties as well as brute force to displace them from their traditional lands. The ability of Native Americans to resist the white settlers was further diminished by animosities between tribes, which were sometimes rooted in traditional rivalries and sometimes provoked by the increasing scarcity of land as the white settlers advanced. As the 19th century began, Native Americans were in retreat from large areas immediately beyond the Appalachian Mountains and were being pushed into the inner and western recesses of the North American continent. Even when some colonial leaders tried to develop positive solutions to help Native Americans, they approached the problem simplistically, as is illustrated by George Washington’s proposed “solution” (see Insert 3.4 ). Insert 3.4. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: George W ashington’ s Solution for Native Americans When thinking about Native Americans, George Washington toyed with a “solution”: why not, he thought, give each Native American a specific amount of land, say 60 acres, on condition that the individual settle on it and engage in agriculture? 1. Discuss this solution from the perspective of ethical principles, such as those discussed in Chapter 1 . 2. Even had Washington obtained support from the Congress for this policy, how might it have worked in practice: a. From the vantage point of Native Americans? b. From the vantage point of white settlers? 3. To the extent that Washington’s solution would not have been ethical or practicable, what more ethical alternative approach might the U.S. government have used? In answering this question, discuss whether the settlers should have honored the Proclamation Line of 1763. Oppression of African Slaves Slavery had existed in Roman times, and Christians had long enslaved Muslims, but the numbers of slaves involved were relatively small, and slavery had ended in Europe by the end of the 14th century. To fill minor labor shortages, Portugal and Spain began using Africans as slaves in their domestic economies in the 15th century. Even this minor use of slaves might have ended had Columbus and numerous successors not established colonies in the New World, first in the Caribbean and then in Central and South America ( Figure 3.2 ). * Figure 3.2. Everett Historical/ Shutterstock.com The slave trade. The wholesale deaths of the indigenous populations from disease and overwork created an economic dilemma for the Europeans when they introduced the labor-intensive crops of sugar and then tobacco in the Caribbean and South America. To find laborers for these crops, the Europeans, drawing on their experience with slavery, decided to import vast numbers of Africans to the New World. By a quirk of biology, these African slaves proved to be relatively resistant to European diseases; thus, not only did they survive, but they could be used as a self-replenishing source of labor. Moreover, the huge African population could be regularly raided for a seemingly endless supply of laborers. By 1670, Portuguese Brazil had at least 200,000 slaves, and the English had at least 20,000 slaves in Barbados. The New World was a labor-hungry society because land had to be cleared, roads built, and crops raised in a harsh environment. Labor was particularly needed in Virginia and the Carolinas, where the settlers had decided to stake their economic existence on tobacco, a labor-intensive crop. Native Americans were a potential source of labor, but they were not willing to work in the settlers’ fields and could not be easily enslaved because they could escape to the wilderness. White indentured servants became the major source of agricultural labor in the early Southern colonies, but they also proved unsuitable because many of them objected to the backbreaking work in the intolerable summer heat and had to be replaced when their prescribed term of indentured service was at an end. They posed a political problem as well, as freed indentured servants roamed the American countryside and agitated against oppressive working conditions when they lacked funds to purchase their own land. When the English economy improved in the mid- 17th century and the harsh working conditions of the tobacco colonies became well known, it was increasingly difficult to recruit the English as indentured servants. * Massive importation of Africans was delayed, however, because the death rate from malaria and other epidemics was so high that planters would have lost most of their slaves. When the death rate declined, the advantages of slaves as a source of labor became obvious. Slaves were kept for life rather than for brief terms and provided a self-replenishing source of labor; the planters would be spared the task of continually recruiting and importing indentured servants. The political and social problems of accommodating freed servants were obviated because slaves were not released. Slaves could be brutally disciplined without the surveillance of local courts; by contrast, indentured servants could be whipped only with consultation from local courts and could request a hearing if they believed they had been mistreated. For slavery to exist, however, the Southern plantation owners had to develop laws that circumscribed the rights of slaves and punished those whites who chose not to cooperate in maintaining slavery. In the tobacco colonies, that legal task had been accomplished by the beginning of the 18th century. Slaves were not allowed to own property; indeed, their property was confiscated in Virginia and given to local parishes for redistribution to poor whites. Whites were forbidden by law to have sexual relations with Africans, and persons who sheltered or assisted runaway slaves were subjected to harsh treatment. Slaves were thus reduced to the legal status of chattel. * The new laws cemented the white population—including the poor whites— behind the oppression of the slaves. Although subject to punishment if they assisted runaways or engaged in sexual activity with them, all white people obtained the right to discipline slaves, even without permission from their owners. Some historians believe that by investing even the poor white population with superior legal rights, the large slave owners decreased the likelihood of alliances between low-income whites and slaves. (Before the enactment of these laws, indentured white servants had often worked in the fields alongside Africans and had even intermarried with them.) Indeed, by the 18th century, many white people in Southern jurisdictions, even those of modest means, saw owning slaves as a sign of respectability and upward mobility. * Although some slaves had reached the New World earlier, the torrent of importation began after 1676, when the Royal African Company’s monopoly was shattered and many private companies entered the lucrative slave trade. Shipments from Africa rose from 10,000 individuals per year in the 1690s to 40,000 per year in the 1790s. Roughly 1 million slaves were imported to the colonies or born in the colonies before the American Revolution. So many slaves were imported that they constituted almost 20% of the population in the New World by the time of the American Revolution—and 40 to 60% of the population of many Southern jurisdictions. The slaves lived on plantations of differing sizes, ranging from huge plantations in rice-growing coastal regions of the Deep South to far smaller holdings of fewer than five slaves in Virginia and Maryland, where masters typically were of relatively modest means. As with Native Americans, a vicious cycle of violence developed. Slaves did not enjoy the harsh working conditions associated with tobacco farming and often refused to work as hard as their masters desired. Their resistance confirmed the white settlers’ beliefs that they were uncivilized and beyond hope of conversion to English values or religion. Racism—the imputation of negative characteristics to entire groups of persons who share similar physiological characteristics—became pervasive in the white community. The slaves’ working and social conditions were often degrading in the extreme. In the rice-growing areas of the coastal Carolinas, slaves worked in gangs of 50 or more as they planted, cultivated, and harvested rice. Less prosperous farmers used smaller groups of slaves to plant corn and other crops. Available evidence suggests that owners made frequent use of whipping; vicious punishment of runaways; “intrusion, inspection, and harassment” of the minutest aspects of their personal lives; sales of “surplus” slaves in a pattern that disrupted familial relationships; imposition of a class system with preferential treatment given to those slaves who worked in the owners’ houses; and a conscious pattern of disrupting families by taking children from them at an early age and often placing husbands and wives in separate sleeping quarters. * By defining African Americans and Native Americans as nonpersons, Southern white settlers did not have to feel guilty about their actions or policies. Violence was often rationalized as serving the broader needs of society or even of the nonpersons themselves. In killing Native Americans, for example, many colonists believed they were promoting the advance of Christianity and civilization, just as many slaveholders believed that harsh treatment of slaves helped teach them discipline and good work habits. But slavery was not only a Southern institution in the colonial period. Slaves were also held in the Northern colonies, until all but New York and New Jersey eradicated the practice during the period from 1776 to 1783. (New York and New Jersey enacted laws that ended the institution in 1799 and 1804, respectively.) Agitation by Quakers and other religious groups assumed a major role in ending slavery in the North. * Although slavery was largely eliminated in the North, Northern representatives at the Constitutional Convention in the 1780s had to decide whether to accede to Southerners’ wishes to retain the institution. Many of the framers of the Constitution eyed slavery uneasily because they feared that social turmoil from slave rebellions would allow England to conquer the South (for its cotton) or might require the federal government to commit troops to restore tranquility. (These pragmatic fears were more prevalent than moral outrage.) Northerners also feared that Southerners would bolt the Constitutional Convention—and the new nation—if they mentioned abolition, but they did not want slavery transplanted to the frontier. They also did not want Southerners to capture control of the Congress by adding large numbers of slave-favoring Congressmen as new states entered the union from frontier areas. This conflict between Northerners and Southerners became the most contentious division during the Constitutional Convention and led to a series of compromises. The Northerners obtained exclusion of slavery from the frontier north of the Ohio Paver in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and were allowed to place a tax on imported slaves. But Southerners won most of the concessions: slavery was not limited to those states where it existed; slaves were counted as though they were three-fifths of a person for purposes of apportioning congressional representatives; and Congress was not permitted to interfere with the importation of slaves until 1807. (Legislation to prohibit importation was finally enacted in 1808.) Slavery was legitimized by the Constitution, which referred to it in five places. * In retrospect, both Southerners and Northerners miscalculated during the Constitutional Convention. Southerners assumed that they would soon control Congress as new slave states were added to the Union and as the population of Southern states increased; thus, they believed no additional interference with the institution would develop. Northerners assumed that slavery would disappear naturally as the economy grew and as yeomen farmers populated the West. Neither side realized that both regions would obtain new states on the frontier, and a political stalemate would culminate in a civil war. In 1787, the two regions disagreed already on other issues as well. Southerners wanted a weak central government that could not impose tariffs or supervise interstate commerce, whereas many Northerners favored a stronger central government. Appleby argues persuasively that the framers left war as the only means of abolishing slavery when they legitimated it in the Constitution. Once legitimated, slavery could not be abolished without passage of a constitutional amendment, but the necessary two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures would have been unattainable once the many Southern states were part of the Union. Had the framers not mentioned slavery in the Constitution, it could have been eliminated by a simple majority vote in Congress, in a manner akin to its abolition by a majority vote in the British Parliament. * When considering African slaves and Native Americans, many colonists were afflicted by racism. Benjamin Franklin feared that African people would “darken” the people of America, who could, by excluding Africans and Native Americans, increase “the lovely White.” And Jefferson advocated the removal of Africans from America so that the New World would be a “sanctuary” for European immigrants and their progeny. Moreover, Congress in 1790 enacted legislation that restricted citizenship to whites—legislation that was used to deny citizenship to Asian immigrants in the 19th century and later. * Discrimination against White Poor People Some white settlers did not own land. Some of them were alcoholics. Others had disabilities. Some were victims of bad luck, such as when their crops were ruined by drought, insects, or hailstones. Some lost their money through gambling. Some had chronic mental diseases. Some were victims of debilitating diseases. Some were violent. When they were impoverished, they were known as “human waste” or “rubbish” or “white trash.” We have already discussed how food riots took place in colonial society. We have discussed how impoverished youth migrated to the New World and became indentured servants. Those white people that could not obtain land in the New World were often in its lower class. As Isenberg notes, “(American) independence did not magically erase the British class system, nor did it root out long-entrenched beliefs about poverty and the willful exploitation of human labor. An unfavored (white) population, widely thought of as waste or ‘rubbish’ remained disposable indeed well into modern times” (Nancy Isenberg, White Trash; the 400-Year Untold History of Class in America, New York, Viking, 2016). Identify Ominous Signs From the earliest colonial era, ominous signs existed that American society would develop a particularly harsh set of policies toward women and persons living in poverty, as well as African Americans and Native Americans. The colonists lived in an agrarian society. They cannot be blamed if their policies and ideas, when inherited by subsequent generations, proved inadequate to the social problems of an urbanized and industrialized nation. Nevertheless, the pervasive influence of certain colonial ideas in the 19th century—and even in the 20th century—served to retard the development of national social programs. Feudal society was replete with regulations and traditions that stifled upward mobility, changes in residence, sale of land, and changes in occupation, but it also offered many protections to its citizens precisely because it was so regulated. Courts protected the rights of serfs and their successors, whether tenant farmers, indentured servants, or apprentices. The early colonies inherited many of these feudal regulations but lacked England’s rich history of enforcement. * The English landed gentry were descendants of the noblemen of feudal times, if not by direct family lineage then by accepting the prescribed social roles when they purchased large estates. In the transition from feudal to postfeudal society, many of the landed gentry in England resorted to enclosure and other policies that harmed emancipated serfs. Others, however, imbued with a sense of obligation to persons in lower social and economic strata, supported policies of job creation and mercantilism. Conservative philosophers like Edmund Burke contended that English society was an “organic” entity bound together by ancient traditions. LO 3-7 Americans in the upper social strata had weaker notions about their social obligations than did their English counterparts. Few aristocrats and noblemen came to America; most immigrants were from the lower and middle classes. These self-made individuals—the American version of an aristocracy—sometimes believed, by the 19th century, that everyone should be able to obtain economic success. Colonial Virginia provides an example of American elites’ limited sense of social obligation. Although Virginia’s landholding aristocracy appeared similar to its English counterpart, available evidence suggests that many powerful landowners possessed scant interest in the needs of the lower strata of society; they expanded their holdings through ruthless exploitation of indentured servants, tenant farmers, and slaves. * Governmental institutions were extraordinarily weak in the colonies and mostly devoted to protecting public order. In the 19th century, the functions of local, state, and federal jurisdictions were curtailed even further when an ideology of limited government became ascendant. The early Americans hoped to create a utopia of land-owning, hard- working, moral citizens. Education would allow children to develop their reason and to learn good work habits. Widespread ownership of land, the colonists believed, would inspire settlers to work hard so as to improve their holdings and increase their personal wealth. Granted democratic institutions, Americans would inform themselves about policy issues so as to prevent the rise of despots who might try to concentrate property and power in the hands of social elites, appease landless and urban lower classes by taking private property from other citizens, or create an urbanized society. By maintaining an agricultural society, Americans would be able to avoid such social problems as unemployment, alienation, crime, and social disorder; colonists believed that these problems inevitably infested urban areas, where wage-earning and poor residents were more prone to social disorder and the appeals of despots. Moreover, early Americans placed extraordinary faith in the family, where moral conduct and the work ethic would be taught and modeled. To summarize, the colonists believed that virtuous conduct was systematically fostered in America by education, widespread land ownership, the absence of excessive economic and social inequality, a system of governance that prevented the emergence of despots, cohesive families, and an agricultural economy. They were convinced that major social problems could not arise in the New World, precisely because they had masterminded a set of political, educational, familial, and economic institutions that would avert them. * Thomas Jefferson waxed ecstatic in a letter to John Adams about the utopian nature of this new nation as compared with Europe: With respect to aristocracy, we should further consider, that before the establishment of the American States, nothing was known to history but the man of the old world, crowded within limits either small or overcharged, and steeped in the vices which that situation generates. A government adapted to such men would be one thing; but a very different one, that for the man of these States. Here every one may have land to labor for himself, if he chooses, or, preferring the exercise of any other industry, may exact for it such compensation, as not only to afford a comfortable subsistence, but wherewith to provide for a cessation from labor in old age. Every one, by his property, or by his satisfactory situation, is interested in the support of law and order. And such men may safely and advantageously reserve to themselves a wholesome control over their public affairs, and a degree of freedom, which, in the hands of the canaille [the proletarians] of the cities of Europe, would be instantly perverted to the demolition and destruction of everything public and private. The history of the last twenty five years of France, and of the last forty years in America, nay of its last two hundred years, proves the truth of both parts of this observation. * This belief that Americans had created a utopian society served to retard the development of social programs by blinding the colonists and succeeding generations of Americans to the existence of social needs in their midst. If America is a utopia, few social programs or regulations are necessary. Even in the 19th century, when the nation began to develop an urban society and poverty and other social needs became relatively widespread, the persistent notion of the American utopia perpetuated a kind of collective denial. Americans aimed to achieve freedom in their new society by developing state and federal constitutions, elaborating a Bill of Rights, ending taxation without representation, establishing freedom of religion, and expanding suffrage. Liberty is an important social objective, but Americans failed to grapple with another vital objective—that of equality, which would have required them to develop institutions capable of reducing economic and social discrepancies. Although the slogan of the French Revolution was liberty and equality, the American Revolution emphasized liberty. When the framers anxiously submitted the Constitution to state conventions for ratification, widespread protests erupted against their work on the grounds that they had not included a Bill of Rights to protect citizens’ freedom against capricious acts of government. In response, the First Congress added the first 10 amendments to the Constitution in 1791. Although the colonists wanted to limit the power of government, they often supported the regulation of prices, economic planning, and public improvements. With the American Revolution completed and the Constitution written, however, a remarkable political conflict took place in the 1790s between allies of Jefferson, who formed the Republican party (which later became the Democratic party), and allies of Washington, Adams, and Hamilton, who formed the Federalist party. The Jeffersonians, whose beliefs formed an American consensus about drastic reductions in the economic role of government, reductions in various federal taxes, and a strict interpretation of the Constitution so that the government did not exceed its enumerated powers, routed the Federalists, who had favored economic planning and a somewhat stronger federal government, in the election of 1800. The American consensus engineered by Jefferson meant that the federal government would remain exceedingly weak for generations. * Identify Precursors to a Reluctant W elfare State Although the term “welfare state” would not be coined until the 20th century, precursors to a limited American welfare state already existed in the colonial period. American social policy in the colonial era cannot be easily characterized because, like English policy in this period, it reflected conflicting tendencies. On the one hand, mercantile policies, local regulation of prices and wages, and the development of Poor Law institutions represented positive responses to social problems. Indeed, these policies can be viewed as distant descendants of feudal notions of social obligation, even if they accorded to governments helping roles that, during the feudal era, had been implemented by the Church and noblemen. On the other hand, many American colonists possessed moralistic (and punitive) orientations toward unemployed persons, believed that government should assist only destitute persons, were extremely fearful of the national government, and believed that social problems like unemployment emanated from moral defects. With the victory of Jefferson in 1800, moreover, the nation tilted decisively toward a limited federal government that was not even granted explicit powers to develop and implement social policies by the Constitution. An array of factors shaped American social welfare policies in the colonial era and led to a reliance on relatively modest local policies. Cultural factors included an emphasis on individualism and limited government. Among political factors, the lack of a large class of landless people and the subjugation of persons of color meant that little pressure was exerted on public officials to develop policies that would redistribute land or resources. Institutional factors included a weak central government as well as relatively weak local jurisdictions. Americans were already displaying an LO 3-8 aversion to taxation as reflected by their dislike of British taxes and a Whiskey Rebellion that questioned the authority of the federal government to levy taxes. Social welfare policy in the colonial period centered on the local Poor Law institutions, which included a mixture of indoor (institutional) relief and outdoor relief. Local courts assumed relatively minor social welfare functions with respect to orphans, divorce petitions, and prosecutions of persons accused of rape. Nongovernmental social welfare agencies made an appearance in the colonial period; the pattern of relatively weak governmental welfare institutions supplemented by nongovernmental programs was already emerging. The policies of Americans toward African slaves and Native Americans, however, appear particularly onerous, even when we note that these white settlers had only the harsh precedent of the Spanish conquests of the Caribbean, Central America, and South America to guide them. Link the Colonial Society to Contemporary America EP 2a EP 3a An American tradition of policy advocacy began even before the American Republic was founded with the election of George Washington as the first president in 1789. Moreover, some social issues in the colonial period still resonate in contemporary American society. LO 3-9 What W e Can Learn from Policy Practitioners and Advocates of the Colonial Era A robust tradition of policy advocacy was much in evidence as Americans moved toward declaring independence from England in 1776, ratified their Constitution in 1788, and elected George Washington to the first of two terms of office in 1789. No one better exemplifies this tradition of policy advocacy than Dr. Benjamin Rush (see Insert 3.5 ). By observing his policy advocacy, we can better understand policy advocacy challenges we confront in contemporary society. Insert 3.5. Proﬁles in Policy Advocacy: Benjamin Rush (1746–1813) Benjamin Rush—physician, abolitionist, Revolutionary patriot, temperance advocate, humanitarian, and signer of the Declaration of Independence—was born in Byberry, Pennsylvania, on January 4, 1746, the fourth of seven children born to John Rush and Susanna Hall (Harvey) Rush. Shortly after the death of his father, Benjamin’s mother opened a country store, which provided a comfortable, but not luxurious, living for the Rush family. In 1759, at 13 years of age, Rush was admitted as a junior to the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). After receiving his bachelor’s degree, Rush initially decided to pursue a career in law but was persuaded by his uncle, Reverend Samuel Finley, to study medicine instead. Between 1761 and 1766, he served as an apprentice to Dr. John Redman, a leading physician in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, Rush also attended medical courses given at the College of Philadelphia by medical professors Dr. William Shippen and Dr. John Morgan. Rush’s interest in politics began while he was a medical student; the British attempt to place a stamp tax on legal documents aroused his political consciousness. Rush, nevertheless, remained a medical student and, in 1765, decided to continue his studies abroad. In 1766, Rush enrolled at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. There he became a protege and friend of Dr. William Cullen, one of the leading chemists of his day. In 1768, Rush received his M.D. and, after a brief stay in London and Paris, returned to the colonies in July 1769. Upon returning to the colonies, Rush began his medical practice, which quickly prospered. Some time later he was appointed professor of chemistry at the College of Philadelphia and held the first chair of chemistry established in the American colonies. When Rush was not engaged in his private practice or teaching, he was writing. In 1770, he published the first American textbook on chemistry. Two years later, he released Sermons to Gentlemen upon Temperance and Exercise , the first American work on personal hygiene. Also, in November of 1770, Rush became a charter member and curator of the American Philosophical Society. In the period between 1770 and 1773, Benjamin Rush’s reform interests led him to work outside of his private practice. He worked as a physician in alms houses, bringing medical care to the poor and participating in the Society for Inoculating the Poor. In that same period. Rush was asked to support a Philadelphia Assembly bill to double the importation tax on slaves, which would have made it prohibitively expensive to bring new slaves to the colony. The successful passage of that bill signaled the beginning of Rush’s campaign against slavery. Despite the fact that his family owned slaves, Rush wrote “An Address to the Inhabitants of the British Settlements in America, upon Slave-Keeping, by a Pennsylvanian,” attacking the institution of slavery and those who participated in it. Particularly controversial was Rush’s claim that the black was in all ways equal to the white person. In 1774, he was instrumental in the formation of the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery. Rush held the British responsible for bringing the institution of slavery to the American colonies and devoted much of his time to supporting America’s political struggle against the Crown. He served as a propagandist, condemning the Tea Act, and wrote essays on patriotism as well as on slavery in the colonies. The latter he usually wrote under pseudonyms. Rush was also an observer at sessions of the First Continental Congress, held in Philadelphia in 1774. There he met and befriended John and Samuel Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington and renewed his friendship with Benjamin Franklin, whom he met while in London. In January 1776, Rush wed Julia Stockton, who was 14 years his junior. In February of the same year, Rush formally entered politics when he was elected to Philadelphia’s Committee of Inspection and Observation, which had as its main objective the implementation of the measures passed at the first Continental Congress, held in 1774. Several months later, Rush was elected to the Provincial Conference to draw up rules for Pennsylvania’s constitutional convention. He was subsequently chosen as a member of the second Continental Congress, and, on July 4, 1776, he became one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. At the end of the Revolutionary War, Rush once again became a professor of chemistry at the College of Philadelphia, which by now had become the University of the State of Pennsylvania (1780). In the summer of that year, Rush founded the Philadelphia Humane Society and began promoting the idea of preventive medicine. In 1783, Benjamin Rush, who by then had earned the respect of those in the American medical profession, was offered a highly prestigious staff position at Pennsylvania Hospital, which he gladly accepted. The end of the war and the emergence of a newly independent nation also brought to Rush’s attention another set of social issues worthy of his reform efforts. He was particularly concerned with the need to develop a public educational system. For Rush, education was a key factor in reforming the character of the newly freed colonies, and he believed schools would serve to unite a diverse group of people. In 1786, Rush wrote the first American essay advocating the establishment of a government-supported educational system. He also believed, unlike many of his contemporaries, that women should have access to education, although he believed they should be trained differently from men. Rush also advocated a need for temperance and prepared the way for what became known as the American temperance movement. Rush’s medical experience led him to see the “evils of alcohol.” In 1784, he published his Inquiry into the Effects of Spiritous Liquors upon the Human Body, and Their Influence upon the Happiness of Society. This was the first essay to detail the physiological effects of alcoholism. It included warnings not only about the physical effects of alcohol on the body but also the dire moral consequences one would face as a result of overconsumption. Rush also spoke out against the use of tobacco, which he believed was another cause of poor health in men. Rush resumed his crusade for the abolition of slavery in the late 1780s. In March 1787, he renewed his membership in the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage. Shortly thereafter, he became the Society’s secretary and, in 1803, he became its president. During this same period, Rush was involved in the penal reform movement and was a founder of the Society for Promoting Political Inquiries. He believed prison terms should be adjusted to fit the crime and fixed by law. Rush opposed capital punishment. His penal reform efforts paved the way for the creation of the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons. During the last two decades of his life, Benjamin Rush devoted most of his time to practicing medicine. He died on April 19, 1813, in Philadelphia. We can discern from Insert 3.5 that Rush applied moral reasoning to a remarkable array of issues. He was morally outraged by the lack of medical treatment for residents of poorhouses, the existence of slavery, the lack of a public system of education, women’s lack of access to education, the widespread abuse of alcohol and tobacco, the poor treatment of prisoners, indeterminate prison sentences, and capital punishment. His persistence in addressing these issues is truly remarkable: his efforts included writing a tract against slavery in the early 1770s, helping to form the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery in 1774, and becoming president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and the Relief of Free Negroes in 1803. Rush’s policy advocacy illustrates a tension in policy advocacy between “playing it safe” and “taking risks” when diagnosing the context. On the one hand, it is tempting to select only issues that have widespread support when engaging in policy advocacy. If everyone engaged in this practice, however, no one would seek important policy reforms that are associated with widespread opposition from the general public or public officials. Many people supported slavery even in the North in the colonial period, as suggested by our discussion of the disinclination of public officials to abolish it in the Constitution. Indeed, abolitionists were even physically attacked in Northern cities in the 1840s and 1850s. Nor did widespread support for giving women access to education exist in a period when many colonists doubted that women possessed the intellectual capability to benefit from it. Not intimidated by adverse public sentiment, Rush plunged ahead even when prospects for immediate policy successes were bleak. What W e Can Learn from the Persistence of Unmet Needs and Policy Issues during the Colonial Era Battles over the meaning and implications of specific provisions of the Constitution did not abate in the centuries following clashes between George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson over the relative power given to the federal government. While the terms “liberal” and “conservative” were not used in the colonial period, they came to suggest distinctly different approaches to interpreting the Constitution in the 20th and 21st centuries that were present even in the colonial period. If liberals tended to believe the Constitution conferred relatively broad powers on the federal government (following in the footsteps of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton), conservatives tended to view it as conferring relatively narrow power to the federal government (sharing the outlook of Thomas Jefferson). If liberals believed that the Constitution provided relatively loose guidelines that could be adapted to changing issues and conditions in society, conservatives believed in “strict constructionism”—that is, adhering to the literal words and intentions of the framers of the Constitution. This conflict between liberals and conservatives over the Constitution emerged with extraordinary force in the second term of the presidency of George W. Bush, when he appointed two conservative jurists to the Supreme Court—leading to conflict between conservative, moderate, and liberal jurists. These clashes would have huge implications for women’s right to choose, affirmative action, regulations of corporations by the government, the right to free expression, the rights of criminal defendants and persons accused of crimes such as terrorism, and the separation of church and state. The Supreme Court in the first five years of Barack Obama’s presidency is the most conservative one in four decades, as we discuss in Chapter 12 . These conflicts over interpretation of the Constitution have strong implications for persons who favor relatively broad powers for the federal government and who oppose strict construction of its provisions. If they do not want the U.S. Supreme Court to veer in a conservative direction, they must get involved in electoral politics so that a relatively liberal president is elected. Had George W. Bush not become president in 2000 or 2004, relatively liberal jurists would have been selected rather than justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito—leading to markedly different court rulings on abortion, affirmative action, corporate powers, rights of employees, and rights of unions. (We discuss these issues in the administration of George W. Bush in Chapter 11 .) What W e Can Learn from Failed Policy Strategies of the Colonial Era Many Americans subscribed in the colonial era to sexism and racism, leading them to support policies in conflict with principles enunciated in the Declaration of Independence. Colonists, therefore, left to future American generations a legacy that would eventually lead to a bloody civil war, violent repression of suffragettes in the early part of the 20th century, a civil rights movement that brought many deaths and injuries in the middle of the 20th century, and ongoing oppression of many vulnerable populations in contemporary society. Oppression of vulnerable populations is not a uniquely American phenomenon. Subjugated Muslim populations in France erupted in violence in 2005 and 2006 in response to segregated housing, poverty, and discrimination. Persons descended from Indian and Caribbean ancestors are often impoverished, segregated, and shunned in Great Britain. Tribal warfare in Africa has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of persons in such nations as Rwanda and Uganda. Women are often forcibly placed in prostitution in many nations of the world. Yet oppression of the 16 vulnerable populations that we identified in Chapter 1 is particularly troublesome in a nation with enunciated principles of equality in the Declaration of Independence—and in a nation that came to be as affluent as the United States in the 20th and 21st centuries. It is fortunate that many Americans came to realize in succeeding generations that prejudice, discrimination, and hostility to women, persons of color, the disabled, low-income persons, Native Americans, children, and many other vulnerable populations are discrepant with the first principles of equality enunciated in the colonies even before the American Republic was formally begun. Not only is oppression of vulnerable populations unethical; it is costly to the nation. Absent decent schools for all Americans, for example, some persons are prevented from becoming productive participants in a global economy. Women subject to harassment on the job are not only less productive, but suffer emotional trauma. Many colonists, too, were imbued with a moralistic stance toward social problems such as poverty. We discuss in the next chapter how the equating of social problems with faults of character or even “sin” left the United States with another legacy that persists even in contemporary society. Moralistic approaches to myriad social problems continue to impede constructive efforts to help and empower persons to surmount them, as reflected by harsh welfare laws that fail to give single heads of households sufficient job training, child care, health care, transportation, and housing to allow them to better their (and their children’s) condition. What W e Can Learn from Promising Strategies of the Colonial Era The policy of selling federally owned land in the territories on the frontier to settlers had already commenced in the early years of the American Republic. Indentured servants who had finished their service, immigrants, and citizens purchased land on the frontier at federal auctions. The purchase of land proved to be a disaster for some persons due to the harsh environment and economy that they encountered. Not only did they have to clear the land and plant crops, but they had to barter or sell agricultural products in an uncertain economy—and face the uncertainties of weather. Nor were some persons of modest means able to afford land at federal auctions, leading some of them to squat on frontier land illegally. Those persons of modest means who did obtain land and homes often benefited from such ownership. Assets can provide a buffer from economic uncertainties, since they can be used as collateral for loans, rented, or sold at a profit if they appreciate in value. Ownership of some assets may enhance the well-being of those persons who see themselves as having a stake in society—as Thomas Jefferson surmised. The colonial experience suggests that contemporary American public policy should try to help persons of modest means gain access to land and homes; however, as can be seen in Insert 3.6 , existing policies often benefit current homeowners more than they help potential owners. Insert 3.6. Critical Analysis: Does the United States Favor Current Homeowners over Renters? Contrast the economic situation of persons with no assets and persons with assets that do appreciate in value. Then ask whether the United States helps persons of modest means sufficiently to get homes when it gives only current holders of mortgages the ability to write off their mortgage payments from their taxable income—a policy that adds to their economic resources. By contrast, renters, who are less affluent as a group than homeowners, are not allowed to write off any of their rent against their taxable income. To the extent that the existing tax code favors current owners of homes, what other policies does—and should —the United States pursue to enable renters to become homeowners? The decision to help persons acquire property and homes is praiseworthy but hardly a panacea. Many Americans acquired land on the frontier only to become bankrupt when they could not get their land to be productive rapidly enough to repay the bank loans they used to acquire the property or when they encountered natural disasters such as drought or hail. We are currently witnessing huge numbers of foreclosures in contemporary society after banks and other lenders engaged in deceptive lending practices to lure persons of modest means to purchase homes. These misfortunes in the colonial era and in contemporary society suggest the need for strong governmental roles in regulating the lending industry and in providing constructive assistance to persons and families that experience economic misfortune soon after acquiring property and loans. Even today, insufficient social policies exist on either count with respect to families at risk of foreclosure due to deceptive lending practices. What We Can Learn from the Colonial Era about the Structure of the American W elfare State Americans possessed a primitive welfare state in the colonial period—if we can even apply the relatively modern term “welfare state” to the modest collection of poorhouses, prisons, and local governments of that era. We must remember that the new Republic was mostly agricultural and that its citizens were—with notable exceptions—relatively poor. Aside from supervising the sale of land at the frontier, engaging in international diplomacy, waging war with Native Americans, and building some canals and other public improvements, the just-formed federal government possessed virtually no resources and had virtually no social welfare functions, forcing local governments and states to assume these functions. Since local and state governments themselves had few resources and negligible social welfare responsibilities, they, too, had only primitive social welfare roles or institutions. Most people believed that, with abundant land and the need for considerable labor to clear and farm it, most persons could and should find work—thus making it unnecessary to help them with government programs. We can observe from the colonial experience that Americans would build their welfare state in the coming centuries “from the bottom upward,” unlike many European nations that already had large regulatory, tax, and social welfare functions vested with central governments and monarchs. The vesting of poorhouses, jails, schools, and mental services with local and state governments at the outset of the Republic and through the 19th century would have some salutary benefits. By being closer to residents, these institutions would be more likely to reflect their wishes and needs. At the same time, however, a bottom-up strategy would present problems for future generations of Americans. In relatively poor jurisdictions or in relatively conservative areas, local services would be shortchanged and underfunded—as is currently reflected in states such as Georgia that severely underfund their educational and social welfare institutions. Some Americans would come to think, moreover, that the federal government ought to have virtually no role in social welfare policy—accurately noting that the Constitution failed even to mention social policy as a federal responsibility. Yet many social problems would subsequently require a federal response due to their complexity, their prevalence across the nation, or their cost. With rare exceptions, we can view the 132 years following the year 1800 as the triumph of local and state roles in social welfare policy. When the federal government developed social welfare roles in the decades following 1932, Americans fashioned a very complex welfare state in which local, state, and federal policies and programs existed side by side. Social workers need navigational skills (as we noted in Chapter 2 in Figure 2.1 ) partly because of this complexity that derives from the bottom-up approach that was followed by the addition of many federal programs after 1932. They have to decide where best to refer clients or consumers to services in this mosaic of programs and policies. They have to decide what entitlements clients or consumers possess with respect to which resources, services, and rights. To the extent that social workers wish to reform existing policies or propose new ones, they must decide what level of government and what policies to engage. We can see, too, from the colonial experience that Americans would likely develop many means-tested social programs that conditioned the receipt of benefits or services upon tests of character and income. To gain assistance from poorhouses or outdoor relief in the colonial period, for example, applicants had to prove they were deserving of such assistance—that is, were not freeloaders and were truly impoverished. It was already widely assumed by many colonists that such assistance would be offered only for brief periods of time and under sufficiently harsh conditions that recipients would never want to seek assistance again. Unfortunately, this harsh orientation toward the provision of assistance even in contemporary society focuses attention on deterrence rather than on providing constructive policies to help persons surmount problems and empower themselves. Policy Scorecard I summarize some important policies in the colonial era that have continued onward to subsequent historical eras. 1. Relatively harsh means-tested welfare programs even if poor houses no longer exist in contemporary society. 2. Key provisions of the U.S. Constitution as amended by the Bill of Rights. 3. Immigration policies that allowed many persons to enter the nation— setting in motion a society that would become an “immigrant nation” to an extent unrivaled by any other society. 4. Policies marked by racism, including slavery, support of slavery in the Constitution, the taking of land from indigenous Native Americans, and use of violence against slaves and Native Americans. 5. Policies that kept women in “separate spheres” that precluded them from voting, holding political office, inheriting wealth, and holding positions in the professions.

Social Policy during a T ransition to an Industrial Nation Introduction The United States gradually industrialized prior to its Civil War in 1860. It had virtually no federal social policies in this period since the Constitution assumed local governments and states were responsible for addressing social problems. This was an era of building institutions for orphans, mentally ill persons, and others. It was also an era where millions of acres were auctioned by the federal government to immigrants and residents. The nation rapidly industrialized in the wake of the Civil War as millions of impoverished immigrants came to the United States to provide labor for its manufacturing plants. It was a period of extreme economic inequality that coupled hugely wealthy persons, such as Andrew Carnegie, with impoverished immigrants. The nation had few social policies to address the economic, medical, mental health, and other social needs of its residents. The first urban reform movement, known as the Progressive Movement, took place in the early part of the 20th century. It mostly focused on regulations to insure safe food and drugs, improve housing conditions, and increase public health. The nation still relied on poorhouses and breadlines to help destitute people. African Americans, women, Latino/as, low-income people, immigrants, and many other vulnerable populations found little support or help from local, state, or federal governments.

Between the inception of the republic in 1789 and the Civil War in 1861, Americans devoted vast energy to problems of poverty, street children and orphans, mental illness, crime, illiteracy, and alcoholism and developed policies concerning Native Americans, Spanish-speaking persons, and African Americans (see Insert 4.1 ).

Were the orphan trains meritorious or did they lead to exploitation of innocent children? Three epic developments posed enormous challenges to the new nation during the 19th century: the rapid settlement of the frontier (over the first eight decades of the century), the Civil War (in the middle of the century), and the development of an industrial system (primarily during and after the Civil War). Americans’ responses to these three events can be understood as a lost opportunity for social reform. Rampant sexism and racism continued to shape Americans’ responses to these epic events as “well as the myriad social problems that they spawned,” as reflected by policies they developed regarding women, Native Americans, Spanish-speaking Americans, African Americans, and Asian Americans. At the end of the chapter, we discuss what we can learn from the early republic about contemporary policy advocacy, social policy, and the structure of the American welfare state. We also discuss what we can learn in contemporary society about policy advocacy, social policy, and the structure of the American welfare state from frontier settlement, the Civil War, and industrialization. Identify Social Realities in the New Nation EP 2a The settlement of areas extending from Pennsylvania to Nebraska, from the Carolinas to Texas, and from the East Coast to the gold mines of California occurred with unprecedented speed. This speed and range of settlement were made possible by a number of factors. Continued immigration from Europe and large families in nonfrontier communities provided a plentiful supply of individuals willing to settle new territories; soil and weather conditions were favorable to settlement; and the settlers encountered ineffective resistance from the indigenous population of Native Americans and Spanish-speaking persons, who were outnumbered and technologically outgunned. * Settling the frontier may sound romantic to contemporary readers, but realities were often harsh. Much like Mexico or Brazil today, the United States was saddled with extraordinary debt as it tried to build its agriculture and industry from scratch. Enormous debts were amassed as Americans borrowed from banks and wealthy individuals in Europe who financed the speculative American economy. During much of the century, the American banking and currency system was in chaos; it was characterized by frequent and sharp recessions; fluctuations between inflation and deflation; unregulated banks that would frequently go bankrupt or charge excessive rates of interest; and the inability of authorities to develop a national bank that could, like today’s Federal Reserve system, promote or discourage economic expansion to avert the twin perils of recession and inflation. Locally and nationally, considerable effort was expended in debates about banking and currency policies to LO 4-1 foster economic growth and to avert recessions. (Americans were inclined to support a variety of economic panaceas—for example, abolishing national banking institutions, using hard rather than paper currency, or issuing more paper currency.) The debates about the economy were fueled by the economic difficulties of countless Americans. Subject to the vicissitudes of world markets and to frequent recessions, farmers, merchants, and bankers often could not repay loans from local or foreign creditors; many local laws allowed imprisonment of debtors even when small sums were involved. (Local courts often practiced leniency.) There was widespread agitation against imprisonment for debt, as well as against local banks and speculators who charged excessive rates of interest or profiteered in land speculation prior to the Civil War. * The scant public resources of the debt-ridden nation were largely devoted to internal improvements that would allow transportation within and settlement of this frontier empire. Despite the initial appearance of industry in New England, American society was predominantly an agricultural nation prior to the Civil War. In 1830, 91% of Americans lived in towns of fewer than 2,500 persons. Eastern cities remained small by modern standards; Philadelphia contained only 120,000 persons in 1830, even though it had grown from 40,000 persons in 1785. Many rural Americans were only distantly aware that a growing population of poor persons lived in urban settings. Farmers, after all, were able to obtain a subsistence living even when they experienced hard times and could not understand that urban Americans lacked this security. * This enormous frontier brought Jefferson’s yeoman republic into existence, diverted attention from serious social problems in the nation, and blunted interest in reforms. Indeed, many Americans assumed that anyone could obtain land and fend for themselves; compassion for persons who lacked the physical and financial means to homestead successfully was limited. Preoccupied with personal economic issues, with settling the Western frontier, and with regional issues, relatively few persons were concerned about barbarous working conditions in the new industries of New England, the plight of tenant farmers on the frontier, or the accumulation of massive quantities of land by speculators and railroads in the West. * Understand Immigration and Urbanization EP 3a Jefferson’s dream of an agricultural Utopia seemed partially realized in the early 19th century, when small landowners, who were often reasonably secure financially, were the dominant social group in the new nation. Together with growing numbers of small businessmen, local officials, and government officials, they formed the American middle class, whose average income was relatively high by English standards. A social and political elite of clergy, businessmen, and large landholders dominated local politics and commanded deference from other citizens. * America had developed a network of cities even before 1860, particularly on the East Coast, and these cities grew at fantastic rates as the nation industrialized in the wake of the Civil War. Before and after the war, cities were plagued by many problems. They increasingly became repositories for immigrants from Ireland and Germany. Between 1814 and 1845, nearly 1 million impoverished Irish citizens—mostly Catholic peasants from southern Ireland, who replaced the predominant immigrant group of the 18th century, the so-called Scotch-Irish from Ulster, who were Protestant— entered the United States. Another 1.2 million Irish immigrants followed these in a scant seven years after the disastrous potato famine of 1845– 1849, which decimated Ireland’s population. * Early American cities were rough places. Speculators hurriedly constructed shantytowns and tenements in the absence of housing codes. Abundant public health hazards—including open sewers and poor sanitation—gave LO 4-2 rise to epidemics. Prostitution, gambling, street begging, and drinking were rampant. Widespread unemployment accompanied the major recessions in 1819, 1833, 1837, and 1857, when as many as one-fifth of the entire populations of New York and other large cities received welfare benefits in almshouses or from outdoor soup kitchens maintained by public and private agencies. * When discussing the hardships of the Panic of 1819, historian Charles Sellers notes: Distress was most acute in the cities…. In Philadelphia, three out of four workers were reported idle … philanthropic groups distributed soup to the starving … the 8,000 public paupers who alarmed other New Yorkers in 1819 swelled in a year to nearly 13,000 … even the smaller towns faced the prospect of families naked—children freezing in the winter’s storm … and everywhere the cities and towns lost population as the destitute fled back to kin in the countryside for subsistence. * Those most susceptible to economic straits during recessions were unskilled laborers, such as cart-men, chimney sweeps, woodcutters, and stevedores, who constituted the largest group in the labor force. * When American industry was still in its infancy, employees of shoe, textile, and other enterprises often worked in groups of as many as 12 employees or in larger groups in the nation’s few factories. Working conditions were generally oppressive. A working week of six 12-hour days was typical; income was at subsistence levels; and rates of job-related injury were high. A wave of strikes occurred in the 1820s and 1830s in Eastern cities. Between 1833 and 1836, there were 172 strikes in New England; strikers demanded a 10-hour day and mobilized a brief “general strike” of 20,000 workers in Philadelphia. Unions maintained a precarious existence, however, because of the newness of American industry, facing court rulings that were adverse to unions, frequent recessions, and company owners’ strong-arm tactics against union organizers. * Census and tax data suggest that, contrary to popular belief, extraordinary differentials in wealth existed in the United States. With the influx of immigrants and the emergence of agricultural, professional, industrial, merchant, and banking elites, economic inequality increased in the cities of New England between the 1820s, when 1% of the population held one- fourth of the wealth, and the 1850s, when 1% of the population held one- half of the wealth. Both before and after the Civil War, mobility between social classes was limited. Residential segregation of social classes existed in all cities. Less information exists about the extent and nature of poverty in agricultural and frontier communities, but a large class of low-paid agricultural laborers helped landowners clear the land and prepare the soil for cultivation. Work on the frontier was often brutally hard; settlers used hand tools and oxen to clear wooded areas. Immigrants were often conscripted to work for labor-contract companies that skimmed profits from their subsistence wages and intimidated them from seeking private employment. * The extraordinary migration of Americans across the landscape, both on the Western frontiers and to Eastern cities from the countryside caused social problems. Prostitution arose to accommodate the imbalanced sex ratios on the frontier and the trend to delay marriage. As people tried to eke out an existence on the frontier or in the growing cities, some responded to economic uncertainty with suicide and alcoholism. In the absence of government institutions, churches, and local leaders, unlawful behavior was widespread in many frontier communities. * A youth crisis developed in the 1840s, when many teenagers, finding themselves without work opportunities at the end of apprenticeship programs, roamed the streets and countryside. However, the crisis eased by the end of the century with the rise of high school education and increasing numbers of jobs in industry ( Figure 4.1 ). As we shall see, Americans built large numbers of orphanages to house youth who left their homes before the age of 16 or those whose parents voluntarily committed them for lack of personal resources to care for them. * Figure 4.1. YMCA Archives/University of Minnesota Libraries Street children at about the time of the Civil War. Where social institutions existed to address economic and social needs, they were often poorly maintained. Touring America in the 1840s, Charles Dickens, the noted English author, found American prisons and almshouses to be scandalous, even when compared with the inhumane English institutions of that period. Almshouses, which represented the major social strategy to deal with social problems, were typically crowded, unsanitary, and poorly staffed. In these institutions, orphans mingled with those who had been categorized, rightly or wrongly, as mentally ill, delinquent, or senile. *Discuss a Moral Crusade EP 1a EP 5b In the first half of the 19th century, a moral crusade was conducted to rid the land of a host of social problems. Most Americans were disturbed not by social and economic inequality but by “willful” violation of the social norms that had characterized village life in earlier periods. Troubled by high levels of drinking, vagrancy, begging, and unemployment, many citizens were determined to battle them by a variety of policy initiatives—for example, building institutions, converting people to evangelical Protestantism, conducting outreach projects to teach morality to poor people and immigrants, and prohibiting consumption of liquor (see Insert 4.2 ). * Insert 4.2. Critical Analysis: Comparing Moral Crusades in the 19th Century and the 1990s Many historians believe that Americans in the early portion of the 19th century exaggerated the moral ills that Americans possessed. 1. Discuss the various factors that, singly and in combination, led Americans to exaggerate moral ills in the early portion of the 19th century. LO 4-3 2. In the 1990s, broad concern developed about crime in the United States even though many kinds of crime were actually declining. Not only did Americans add to their police forces, but some states, such as California, went on a prison construction binge. Moreover, Americans were reluctant to enact gun controls in many jurisdictions partly because they wanted to allow people to keep weapons to defend themselves. (Many of these weapons end up killing not criminals, but family members in accidental shootings.) Why have Americans been so fearful of crime in the contemporary period? 3. Can you think of other situations in which citizens have developed exaggerated fears that have led to specific policy enactments regarding issues such as drugs, homeless populations, or (even) terrorism? What fears about immigrants led to punitive legislation toward immigrants in Arizona and other states between 2010 and the present time? What fears make up the basis for partisan disagreement over immigration reform in 2013? Historians have advanced many explanations for the moral crusade in the first half of the 19th century. Some implicate the alarm felt by many citizens at the rapid growth of cities and the influence of the frontier; both were widely perceived as causing lawlessness, alcoholism, internal discord, prostitution, and gambling—in short, as ruining the morals of American sons and daughters who migrated to urban areas from the tranquility and social order of villages. Others note widespread popular animus toward the growing legions of Irish and German immigrants, many of whom were Catholic; members of the established Protestant population came to believe that they were being inundated by uncivilized people who would provide a breeding ground for alcoholism and crime. Still others implicate religious motivations; the 1820s and 1830s witnessed the eruption of a vast religious movement that sought to convert Americans to evangelical Protestantism, complete with fiery sermons, streamside baptisms, and tent revivals. Armed with religious fervor, many Americans sought to convert souls not just to religion but away from what they perceived as evil habits, such as drinking. Nor were fears of social problems altogether unfounded. In fact, Americans consumed extraordinary amounts of liquor early in the 19th century as compared with later periods. Many social problems were highly visible; beggars and street children were seen in the growing cities and vagabonds in the countryside. Still, contemporary historians correctly note that many of these fears were exaggerated. Fears of immigrants were partly based on prejudice against Catholics and foreigners. While possessing social problems, cities were hardly bastions of alcoholism and crime. However, these fears arose in the context of explosive social and economic change. The scale of migration to the frontier is without parallel in world history (except perhaps for the movement of tens of millions of Russians from their Western settlements to an Eastern frontier to escape the Nazis during World War II). Although most of America remained predominantly agricultural, the large and rapidly expanding Eastern cities were new and strange phenomena. As villages expanded into larger towns and towns became cities with heterogeneous populations that included immigrants, local leaders were less able to use peer pressure to enforce social norms of deference and religious observation. The social reform policies of the early and mid 19th century cannot be understood without placing them in the context of these rapid social changes and the fears they engendered. * In the first half of the 19th century, America had a potpourri of Protestant sects, some Catholic strongholds in Eastern cities, and a small number of Jewish settlers. Local clergy assumed major social and political roles in promulgating social norms, in inveighing against such sins as drinking and swearing, and in urging citizens to be industrious. Partly because of this religious backdrop, social problems were generally seen in moral terms. Many persons believed that bankruptcy was caused by profligate spending; crime by drinking or lack of deference to social superiors; and insanity by lust. Problems were commonly perceived to be interrelated; thus, persons who ceased to attend church might be expected to become alcoholics and then delinquent or insane. * Social theorists, politicians, and citizens believed that alcoholism, crime, insanity, gambling, prostitution, and vagrancy were caused solely by individual and moral defects—or by immoral special interests such as the liquor industry. They stereotyped paupers as the progeny of families with intergenerational poverty, and they equated common social problems with immigrant populations, whose numbers expanded sharply in the last half of the century. This preoccupation with morality blinded Americans to alternative explanations of social problems, such as lack of employment, an undisciplined economy that led to frequent recessions, discrimination against immigrants, and lack of adequate social institutions for urban residents. Furthermore, these moral conceptions of social problems led Americans to embrace equally simplistic solutions, which tended to combine moral, religious, educational, disciplinary, and deterrent policies. * To implement their moral crusade, 19th-century social reformers usually turned to local governments and nongovernment organizations such as sectarian agencies and churches. The development of national solutions to social problems was impeded by the localistic nature of the new society. As we discussed in Chapter 3 , the colonists harbored fears that the newly established federal government would interfere with the autonomy of the states, and a national grassroots movement nearly sabotaged approval of the American Constitution, in the belief that it gave the national government excessive authority. After the Republic was established, these fears did not diminish. In the early 19th century, John Calhoun, Henry Clay, and other successors to Hamilton wanted the federal government to subsidize canals, roads, bridges, and other public improvements, but their limited programs were constantly attacked by allies of Jefferson, who believed them to be unconstitutional. Thus, Madison refused in 1817 to fund internal improvements because the power to do so was not mentioned in the Constitution, and in 1830 Jackson vetoed federal assistance to a local turnpike on the grounds that it represented favoritism. Indeed, the Jacksonian era (1828–1836) represented a golden age of decentralization and of limited government institutions. Critics believed that this preoccupation with localism and limited government severely impeded the nation’s ability to cope with pressing economic problems; for example, Jackson’s dismantling of the national bank in 1832 meant that federal authorities could not soften the frequent violent swings in the economy. Nor did federal authorities possess sufficient resources from their minimal taxes to fund significant programs even had they desired them; the entire federal government numbered 153 people at the start of the Jefferson administration in 1800 and had increased to only 352 people by 1829. * Localism led not only to attacks on powers of the national government but also to opposition to economic activity by state governments. In the early 19th century, many states provided major funds for internal improvements such as turnpikes and canals, but by mid century these interventions were increasingly seen as ill-advised use of government power that helped certain sections of the population at the expense of others. Many Americans initially resisted assistance to local educational institutions by the states, on the grounds that it represented undesirable centralization of authority. The major exception to this trend to limit government powers was a series of Supreme Court rulings that gave state governments the right to use private land for public purposes (eminent domain) and the right to charter monopolies, as well as rulings that gave the federal government the right to interpret the interstate commerce clause in relatively broad fashion. * Presidents continued to believe that social welfare programs belonged exclusively within the province of local government. Dorothea Dix successfully persuaded Congress to enact a bill in 1854 to allow the federal government to give the proceeds of some federal land sales to states to help them construct mental institutions, but President Franklin Pierce vetoed it with a message that expressed the philosophy of virtually all of the presidents of the 19th century: I can not find any authority in the Constitution for making the Federal Government the great almoner of public charity throughout the United States. To do so would, in my judgment, be contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and subversive of the whole theory upon which the Union of these States is founded … And when the people of the several States had in their State conventions, and thus alone, given force to the Constitution, … they ingrafted thereon the explicit declaration that “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution … are reserved to the States.” … Can it be controverted that the great mass of the business of Government—that involved in the social relations … the mental and moral culture of men … the relief of the needy or otherwise unfortunate members of society—did in practice remain with the States? * Analyze Social Reform Policies EP 1a EP 1b EP 6a Americans developed three kinds of social policies in the early and mid 19th century. First, many popular policies consisted of “moral treatment” for Americans who had fallen (or might fall) into “sinful” lifestyles, including crime, alcoholism, mental illness, or neglect of religion. Second, some social policies were initiated to give Americans political, economic, and social opportunities, such as voting rights, public education, land distribution, and abolition of imprisonment for indebtedness. Finally, policies were devised to control, regulate, and oppress people of color— notably, African Americans and Native Americans—and Spanish-speaking persons. (We will discuss the latter policies later in this chapter in connection with the frontier and the Civil War.) LO 4-4 Temperance The temperance movement, which easily exceeded abolitionism in size and political influence, was the largest social reform movement in the several decades preceding the Civil War. In 1833, the American Temperance Society had 6,000 chapters, with a combined membership of 1 million persons. The making and selling of alcoholic beverages had been a major business in America since colonial times, when many farmers had derived substantial income from grain sales to distilleries. Alcoholic beverages were sold in a national network of taverns that served local residents in towns and travelers along many stagecoach routes. The tavern was a central social institution in American villages, towns, and cities. But many Americans perceived even social drinking as immoral behavior with ominous implications for individuals and the nation. Temperance reformers believed that someone who sipped alcohol socially moved inexorably toward heavier use, which eventually culminated in alcoholism, crime, insanity, and poverty. They feared that the nation’s population would descend into debauchery and decline as large numbers of Americans followed this course. Alcoholism was widespread, and scores of inebriates could be found in cities and in many towns, but this catastrophic scenario mainly reflected the reformers’ own fantasies and fears. Temperance crusaders sought to restrict licenses for taverns, to tax alcohol heavily, and to limit retail sales of alcohol to consumers in various localities in the 1820s and 1830s. In some areas, they obtained legislation that allowed courts to impose fines or prison sentences on sellers and users of alcoholic beverages. Countless pamphlets were written and distributed to warn Americans of the dangers of alcohol, to link drinking with atheism and immoral living, and to warn that “the very first drink is a long step toward Hell.” When these various remedies still had not eradicated the problem, temperance reformers turned to state legislatures to obtain passage of laws modeled after legislation that had first been enacted in Maine. Local and state temperance societies circulated petitions and presented hundreds of signatures to local and state politicians; scrutinized the positions of candidates of both major parties as a prelude to supporting or opposing them in local elections; and solicited contributions for acceptable candidates. In the 1840s and 1850s, 13 states enacted prohibitions on the sale of alcohol that made it possible to seize and confiscate alcoholic beverages. Court cases involving illegal sales of alcohol were placed in preferred positions on court calendars to avoid customary delays in litigation. Despite these ambitious efforts, the temperance movement had only limited success. Most states rescinded their prohibition laws by the 1870s because of adverse court rulings that declared that government interference with the making and selling of liquor was unconstitutional. Although many white Protestant citizens supported prohibition, Irish and German immigrants vehemently opposed it—as did substantial numbers of middle- and working-class Americans—on the grounds that drinking and socializing in taverns were integral to their culture. So divisive was the issue in some areas that politicians sought to avoid it by insisting that decisions be made by voters in popular referenda, where restrictive measures were defeated. Local police were often reluctant to enforce prohibition statutes or were so understaffed that enforcement was impractical. Despite repeated defeats, efforts to limit consumption of alcohol continued, if ineffectually, in the latter part of the 19th century and resurfaced with the imposition of national prohibition by the Volstead Act of 1919, which was subsequently repealed during the Franklin Roosevelt administration in 1933. * The temperance crusade illustrates analytic deficiencies that were common to reformers in the antebellum period. Alcoholism is caused by many factors, including culture, the presence of role models in families, genetic predisposition, poverty, psychological and physical factors, advertising, and peer pressure. When they contended that immorality was the primary cause of alcoholism and that prohibition would eradicate the problem, temperance reformers took a simplistic approach to a complex problem. In reality, neither the legal prohibition of alcohol consumption nor horror stories of ruined lives will suffice as deterrents, as our long history of temperance reform proves. Antipauperism Strategies Americans had always believed that individuals could be self-sufficient if they worked hard and adhered to moral principles. Armed with this moral perspective, most Americans were not overly fearful in the 17th and 18th centuries that lack of work would be a major social problem because they believed that virtually all Americans could own land. Although some Americans urged a deterrent approach to welfare, including incarceration in hostile and punitive workhouses, it was commonly assumed in the colonial era that local poor relief would be used mostly by persons who had a legitimate claim to it, such as those disabled as a result of accidents, wars, disease, or old age. By the early 19th century, and certainly by the 1830s, many Americans feared pauperism as much as alcoholism. They saw numerous very poor people for the first time, not only within large cities in the East but even in smaller towns. As Americans became part of the world economy, periodic recessions led to massive unemployment, particularly in urban areas. Shortages of food and fuel became so acute during severe winters that large numbers of families risked starvation and death. Disease and work-related accidents left many persons temporarily or permanently disabled; high rates of mortality and social dislocation increased the population of orphans, who sometimes became street beggars. Particularly from the 1840s onward, Eastern cities received waves of immigrants from Europe, who were penniless and without job skills; many vagabonds roamed the American countryside in search of employment. Children who had lost their parents or who had left their homes in their early teens in search of work were often on the streets; some shined shoes or sold newspapers for small change. With the demise of indentured service in the 19th century, new immigrants were cast into the job market and were free to migrate wherever they wished after their arrival. Technically, they could be returned to their first residence if they sought relief in a new location, but laws of settlement were difficult to enforce in a society with extensive migration. * To address the problem of pauperism, American reformers devised three major strategies: 1. They sought to vastly increase the number of almshouses and to modify their internal operations to make them truly deterrent 2. They tried to establish personal contact with millions of low-income youth to prevent pauperism 3. They tried to establish systems of surveillance so that charity was not given indiscriminately to destitute persons The second and third strategies led to the development of various nongovernment organizations, which we will discuss shortly. Numerous Americans had advocated the construction of workhouses (also known as almshouses or poorhouses) in the colonial era, but in many areas they had not been built because of indifference to the plight of the poor, the relatively small numbers of public wards, and the absence of economic resources to build and maintain them. Indeed, some localities resorted extensively to outdoor relief, and laws of settlement were often not vigorously implemented. The antipauperism reformers of the 1820s and 1830s sought to breathe new life into the older deterrent ideas and policies that had not been fully implemented. Before 1820, New York State had allowed localities to decide for themselves whether to use almshouses, apprenticing out, or outdoor relief. In 1824, the Yates Report, which was issued by the secretary of the state of New York, recommended the construction of poorhouses by every county in New York State; an ambitious construction program followed. Subsequent legislation in New York State strengthened laws of settlement and required their vigorous enforcement. New York City, which bore the brunt of the state’s welfare costs, succeeded in obtaining state resources to assist it in enlarging its poorhouse and its house of correction. The work component of the poorhouse and its internal programs were strengthened. Women and children were often put to work weaving garments and making other articles, whereas able-bodied men were made to engage in manual labor, such as working on public roads and chopping wood. Some antipauperism advocates even hoped that the poorhouse might actually cover its expenses through the sale of commodities and the labor of its residents. Residents were increasingly placed under a rigorous regimen that extended beyond work. They were required to follow a strict schedule, which included spartan meals, long hours, lectures on morality, and religious observation. Poorhouses truly became “total institutions” that sought the moral regeneration of residents through techniques that their supporters believed could be applied with scientific precision. * As in the instance of temperance reformers, antipauperism advocates soon found that their ambitious plans were foiled by numerous factors. Most persons who sought public relief could not be “saved” because the reasons for their pauperism had nothing to do with their moral character. Poorhouses increasingly became places of residence for elderly persons who were sick or disabled and for persons with mental disabilities or disorders. Poorhouse officials had no recourse but to provide outdoor relief when recessions occurred because the number of nearly starving citizens far exceeded available spaces. Epidemics and occupational accidents filled workhouses with persons with disabilities in an era that lacked medical science and work safety provisions. Many orphans needed assistance because their parents abandoned them or died in epidemics. Immigrants were often forced to seek assistance because they arrived penniless in the new nation (see Figure 4.2 ). Figure 4.2. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division [LC-D4-5982] A product of the era of institutions. These crushing realities, which were more significant causes of pauperism than moral character, were generally ignored in an era that was fascinated with personal morality. Antipauperism crusaders joined other reformers who sought to form nongovernment organizations that could establish personal contact with poor persons to elevate them to high moral standards. One of the major crusades to reach the poor was the Sunday School movement, an effort to bring hundreds of thousands of low-income children into Sunday schools. At its zenith around 1835, the American Sunday School Union, which possessed its own administrative staff, independent of existing denominations, had roughly 400,000 recruits. Thousands of middle-class teachers were recruited, trained, and supervised; they provided highly structured religious and moral instruction to low-income youth to help the children internalize such moral principles as honesty and industry. Teachers avoided physical punishment, relied on a system of rewards and punishments, provided structured lectures and exercises, and used extensive peer pressure to discipline recalcitrant children. (Children who did not take moral instruction seriously were given dunce status and, if necessary, expelled.) Leaders in the Sunday School movement were convinced that its success hinged on the instructional skills of the teachers, whose training and supervision were rigorous. Massive parades of the various schools were held in cities to increase community recognition of the movement and facilitate the recruitment of youth. * As in the case of temperance and antipauperism, however, Sunday School leaders found their hopes dashed by the time of the Civil War. Immigrants were increasingly Catholic and resisted efforts by condescending Protestants to instruct them. Volunteer teachers willing to submit to high standards and intense supervision became more difficult to find. The zeal of reformers diminished as the reform momentum declined, and many of them turned to other causes. But as with the temperance crusade, it was the intrinsic weakness of the Sunday School reformers’ ideology that led to the movement’s demise. Poor immigrants often resisted reformers’ outreach because they themselves realized that their poverty was caused by labor markets, poor health, and unemployment rather than by lack of moral character. Some reformers believed that the rise in pauperism was the result of undisciplined and indiscriminate relief giving by charitable and public organizations. Many nongovernment charitable groups had arisen in the early 19th century; these included organizations that helped specific ethnic groups or occupations, widows or single women, and individuals with specific problems, such as debtors. Local politicians also gave funds to applicants who came to their offices, whether the money came from personal coffers or from the city treasury. Reformers feared that devious applicants could seek aid from multiple sources, feign poverty, or use charity to avoid work (see Insert 4.3 ). Insert 4.3. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: When Are People “Deserving” or “Undeserving” of Assistance? 1. Discuss under what circumstances, if any, people in need are undeserving of financial assistance. To ground your analysis in concrete cases, establish a typology of people who cannot support themselves, and analyze why persons in each group do not work: Persons who become unemployed during recessions because of an absence of jobs no matter how diligently they search for them Workers who cannot support themselves (or their families) because their wages are too low People who do not work because of mental disorders or disabilities, physical disabilities, or substance abuse People who lack the skills to obtain employment Persons who must care for other persons in their households, such as disabled children, spouses, or relatives 2. If relatively few people become destitute because of “character defects,” discuss the ethical dangers faced by policy makers who devise punitive policies for their relief-giving programs. Specifically, discuss the ethical dangers of poorhouses, by referring both to first ethical principles and program outcome (or utilitarian) considerations. Now fast forward to the present time. Do contemporary policy makers sometimes ethically err by seeking dramatic cuts in safety-net programs, such as nutritional programs, when even working persons often lack survival resources? The remedy to prevent indiscriminate giving was to tighten the administration of charity institutions. For example, the nongovernment Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor (AICP), which was active in New York City during the 1840s and 1850s, divided the city into many districts, where agencies were convened regularly to exchange information about recipients and to tighten their giving procedures. Procedures for carefully interrogating applicants were established so that false stories could be detected. A cadre of middle- and upper-income staff was trained to become skilled interviewers who would be in a position to deny assistance to undeserving persons and then to initiate an intensive personal relationship with them and teach them moral virtues through instruction and by personal example. The AICP also developed the first model tenement and helped enact a pure milk law—projects that suggest its leaders also sought broader social reforms. (We will note later in this chapter how charity organization societies, which were similar to, but larger and more bureaucratic than, the antipauper organizations in the antebellum period, developed in a number of cities after the Civil War.) * Identify Character-Building Institutions EP 5a In the early and mid 19th century, reformers organized the construction of many public institutions, including prisons, mental institutions, houses of correction, orphanages, houses of refuge for youth, and institutions for people who had been diagnosed as deaf, blind, or “feebleminded.” An institutional strategy was ideally suited to these reformers who wanted to change moral behavior by placing persons in an environment where they could be subjected to intensive moral treatment, undiluted by external distractions. It is difficult for contemporary citizens to understand the mind-set of the reformers who established institutions in the 19th century because we live in an anti-institutional era in which institutions are widely reviled. As Eric Monkkonen argues, reformers in the 19th century were proud of these institutions, which, they believed, rescued unfortunate individuals from unsavory lives and influences in the external world, from incarceration in poorhouses, or from lodging in police stations. * Citizens would boast of the institutions in their locale as local landmarks. Leaders of churches and ethnic groups avidly raised funds for these highly visible institutions, thousands of which dotted the American landscape by the latter part of the 19th century, and invested extraordinary effort in keeping them running. As we shall see, the idealistic origins of these institutions were often subverted when reformers found that they could not secure operating funds sufficient LO 4-5 to prevent overcrowding and warehousing of residents in a custodial environment. In colonial societies, prisons merely held lawbreakers without attempting to change their behavior. Prisoners comprised an indiscriminate mixture of people—youth, murderers, burglars, debtors, and others. Children younger than 7 could not be imprisoned, but some jurisdictions allowed children between the ages of 7 and 14 to be imprisoned and even subjected to the death penalty if courts believed they knew the difference between right and wrong. These prisons were often privately owned; the proprietors charged inmates a fee for their residence and would not discharge them until they or their friends had paid their bills. Reformers in the 19th century sought to transform prisons from custodial institutions to ones that systematically instructed their residents. Daily regimens of labor, reflection, and instruction were planned as a method of changing the behavior of inmates. Physical punishment was avoided insofar as possible; reformers hoped to create an environment where inmates would voluntarily modify their behavior and adopt moral virtues. * Many reformers became convinced that persons with mental problems should be removed from almshouses and placed in separate institutions for the insane. They, too, wanted to use moral treatment to rehabilitate persons with mental disorders. A cadre of reformers—including many physicians who subsequently became the superintendents of mental institutions— lobbied for the construction of these institutions, including Dorothea Dix. (We present a Profile in Policy Practice and Advocacy that discusses Dorothea in Insert 4.4 .) Insert 4.4. Proﬁles in Policy Practice and Advocacy: Dorothea L ynde Dix (1802–1887) Dorothea Lynde Dix, the daughter of Joseph and Mary (Bigelow) Dix, was born in Hampden, Maine, on February 11, 1802. Dix is best remembered as a teacher and crusader for the humane treatment of the mentally ill. She is credited with having prepared the way for this country’s mental health movement. Dix’s childhood, which was greatly influenced by her parents’ relationship with her grandparents, was a combination of blessings and challenges. Her paternal grandfather, Elijah Dix, was a wealthy doctor and land speculator. When Joseph Dix married Mary Bigelow, a woman several years older than he was, Elijah reacted with great displeasure. Elijah also believed Bigelow was beneath his son’s class. In addition, once married, Joseph would not be allowed to complete his studies at Harvard because Harvard refused to allow married individuals to matriculate. Thus, the relationship between Dorothea Dix’s parents and her grandparents was already severely strained by the time she was born. Shortly after their marriage, Joseph and Mary Dix moved to Hampden, Maine, where, despite their disagreements, Joseph was made land agent for one of Elijah’s holdings. The couple soon discovered, however, that Elijah’s kindness was still limited when it came to his son Joseph and his daughter-in-law Mary. They were provided with a one-room shack for a home. Life in Maine was fraught with hardships, least of which was the bitter cold of winter. It was during one of these cold winters that Dorothea Lynde Dix was born. Joseph Dix, who left his job as a land agent to become a Methodist preacher, rarely spent time with his wife and daughter. As a result, Mary Dix became discouraged; furthermore, she suffered from depression and was unable to give Dorothea the love and attention all children need and deserve. At 12, Dix left her parents’ home and moved to Boston to live with her grandmother. Once there, Dix’s hopes for love and kindness were quickly dashed, as her grandmother meted out severe punishments, which she viewed as the only way to instill self-discipline, tidiness, and respect for adults. There is very little record of Dix’s formal education. Many believe that either she taught herself how to read and write while still living with her parents or she attended the Hampden Academy. What is certain is that her primary vocation was teaching, which she began to do at the age of 14, in Worcester, Massachusetts. At 19, Dix opened a school in Orange Court at her grandmother’s home. Dorothea Dix taught, directed the school in Orange Court, and published several literary works until 1836, when she experienced a severe physical and emotional collapse. In 1837, while recovering from her health problems, Dorothea Dix visited England and learned about the York Retreat. The York Retreat was an asylum for those suffering from mental illness, where patients were clinically assessed and treated. This visit sparked Dix’s interest in the treatment of mental health, but her crusade for reforming the entire mental health establishment would be triggered by things she saw closer to home. Her grandmother had died by 1841, leaving a portion of her estate to Dix. Combined with her own monies, she had enough to live comfortably for the rest of her life. Instead, she returned to teaching, only this time she taught Sunday school at the East Cambridge women’s jail. Her first experience inside the East Cambridge jail would change the course of Dorothea Dix’s career. Inside she spoke to poor women who were incarcerated for no reason other than mental illness. While walking around the jail, she also noticed that the area set aside for these women was cold and lacking even the slightest hint of humanity. She quickly learned that one of the major problems facing the mentally ill in jail was the ignorance of those in charge. Their reference to the mentally ill as “lunatics” unaware of their own feelings substantiated Dix’s hypothesis. Deeply angered over the inhumane conditions that existed at East Cambridge jail, Dorothea Dix committed the rest of her life to crusading for the humanization of treatment for the thousands of mentally ill people living in America. Her initial work began in Massachusetts, where she conducted surveys of all of the facilities housing the mentally ill. She soon realized that the conditions at other facilities were far worse than at East Cambridge. Together with Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, Dix sent a “memorial” to the Massachusetts legislature, documenting the results of her surveys and requesting that the state legislature provide funds for the treatment of the indigent mentally ill. In 1843, after Dix’s initial request had been denied, her second request was approved by the Massachusetts legislature. Dix also began crusading in neighboring states, including New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Her first major victory came in Trenton, New Jersey, where she fought for and won the establishment of the State Hospital in Trenton. At least 32 other mental health facilities were established in the following decades, after Dix had interviewed more than 10,000 mentally ill persons, traveled 10,000 miles by carriage, and visited 300 county jails and 500 poorhouses. By 1848, Dorothea Dix had taken her crusade for the humane treatment of the indigent mentally ill to the nation’s capital. Aided by several congressmen, Dix produced a bill that would have provided federal land grants to states for erecting mental health facilities. Unfortunately, President Franklin Pierce vetoed the bill in 1854, claiming the bill was neither constitutional nor economically feasible. During the Civil War, Dix served as superintendent of United States Army Nurses, where she was responsible for recruiting nurses for the Union Army. As she did in her many other endeavors, Dix exceeded her mandate and began working on ways to improve the quality of army hospitals. By 1863, the Surgeon General had reclaimed authority over the recruitment of nurses, and in 1866 Dix left Washington, DC, returning to her advocacy for the mentally ill. Even though her own health was quickly deteriorating, Dix continued her tireless activism within the mental health movement for several years after the war. In July 1887, Dorothea Lynde Dix died at Trenton Hospital, which she had fought for and won for the wellness of others. Dorothea Dix’s career illustrates that personal characteristics such as persistence are critical to policy advocacy—persistence that is fueled by moral outrage. Policy advocates are sometimes rewarded with quick successes, but they must often engage in policy advocacy for long periods of time to gain victory—particularly when they encounter a context that is relatively hostile to their goals. Dorothea Dix did achieve a string of successes in different states, persuading state legislatures to establish at least 33 mental health facilities over a span of roughly 20 years, not counting her work after the Civil War. But she was denied her goal of having the federal government help fund mental health facilities in states by use of proceeds from federal land sales when the president vetoed federal legislation she had persuaded both Houses of Congress to approve. Undeterred by this setback, she continued to be an advocate for mentally ill persons after the Civil War. Her modus operandi was to engage in a massive campaign to educate the public and elected officials about the maltreatment of mentally ill persons that would markedly change the context of the issue. Realizing that most persons had scant understanding of mental illness, much less the maltreatment of mentally ill people in poorhouses and prisons, Dix focused on tirelessly educating them through herculean efforts that included traveling 10,000 miles by carriage, interviewing more than 10,000 mentally ill persons, and visiting 300 county jails and 500 poorhouses. She coupled this public education with assertive communications with members of state legislatures. Placing her findings about the maltreatment of mentally ill persons in their state in a “memorial” that was circulated to them and to the mass media and that was filled with lurid details that she had collected directly from mentally ill persons and her own observations, she made it virtually impossible for them to do nothing. Her tactic of using a memorial not only succeeded in placing the topic on legislators’ agendas , but was preceded by concrete policy proposals about where to locate and build one or more mental facilities in specific states and how to fund them. Dorothea Dix’s policy victories also illustrate an important reality in policy advocacy: the importance of troubleshooting or implementation that we discussed in Figure 2.1 . It was beneficial to move mentally ill persons from jails and poorhouses into mental institutions, but only if these institutions themselves delivered humane services. Unfortunately, once the aura of success had waned, many states ceased to provide sufficient funding for these mental institutions—and began also moving to them large numbers of older persons with dementia and chronic diseases who previously had been placed in poorhouses. By the beginning of the 20th century, then, mental institutions were often in disrepair and overcrowded—with their staff often chosen according to political connections rather than professional merit. They often became merely custodial institutions. Mental institutions began to be emptied with the development of psychotropic drugs in the wake of World War II that allowed many mentally ill persons to be deinstitutionalized into the community. (We discuss subsequently how this policy, too, has proved problematic in many states up to the present time.) Like many Americans in this era, Dix viewed cities as unwholesome places that created, or at least exacerbated, mental problems. They wanted relatively small institutions to be located in rural areas, where staff could establish a personal and caring relationship with residents and supervise regimens that included meditation, moral and religious instruction, gardening, recreation, and hard work. Like prison reformers, they opposed the use of physical restraints whenever possible because they wanted residents to internalize new moral codes. Many of these mental institutions probably realized the objectives of their founders and superintendents. Their records show that many residents were discharged after marked improvement. Apart from the moral and religious overlay, their approach to treatment of mental illness had much in common with contemporary efforts to create a supportive and low-stress environment for patients with psychiatric disorders. But these institutions, like prisons, were ultimately sabotaged by political and demographic realities. Funds were provided to construct many institutions but not to foster their maintenance or expansion. After the Civil War, their clientele increasingly consisted of low-income, non-English-speaking, Catholic immigrants who resisted the moral regimens that were established by middle-class Protestant reformers. The state mental institutions depended on local boards of overseers for referrals from local poorhouses, but they increasingly referred older persons and those with senile dementia who could not benefit from moral treatment. As low-income and elderly residents moved into the institutions, some middle-class persons began to use private institutions. Consequently, the state mental institutions, now perceived as repositories for destitute persons, were even less likely to receive adequate funding from state legislatures. * New institutions for children were built. Convinced that they possessed scientific knowledge about the idiosyncratic needs of specific groups, reformers set about developing specialized services for each group, rather than mixing them together. The dizzying array of specialized institutions for children included houses of refuge, orphanages, homes for “wayward children,” and institutions for the “feebleminded.” Houses of refuge were intended for delinquent and neglected children. Colonial laws gave authorities the right to sever parental custody when children were neglected or had become vagabonds, though some authorities only reluctantly removed children from their homes. Roughly one-half of the children admitted to the houses of refuge came from court orders, and the remainder were voluntarily placed by parents because they lacked the funds or capacity to care for them. Like prisons and mental institutions, houses of refuge combined lecture, study, and physical labor. Reformers believed that these houses were effective in helping many youths, but many residents fled from them, and considerable turmoil existed within them. * Orphanages were established for poor children, usually of school age, whose parents (or parent) could no longer support them or would not support them. Some came from intact families, whereas others were wayward children who lived on the streets. (Most street children, variously called waifs, ragamuffins, and half-orphans, were poor urban working-class children without intact families.) To understand a common scenario by which children entered orphanages, consider a woman whose husband died and left her with five children to support. What was she to do? Unless her husband left her a business or farm, she often had to resort to taking in laundry or boarders or doing piecework at home—for example, sewing garments. (Other occupations were closed to most women in this period, and, with five children, she could hardly become a live-in domestic servant —a primary source of income for unmarried women.) Surveying her bleak economic prospects, the woman might voluntarily send three of her children to an orphanage, where they would remain until the age of 16. In other cases, local justices of the peace committed children to orphanages if they ruled that their parents could not properly meet their needs or if the children were living on the streets. Irish, German, and other immigrant groups, as well as churches, constructed large numbers of orphanages in the 19th century; indeed, Baltimore alone had 28 of them by 1910. Although all orphanages provided moral training, their programs varied widely. In some, children attended public schools, whereas others provided some of their education within the institution. Some emphasized vocational education; others provided general education. Some were built in cities, whereas others were in rural settings. In addition to orphanages, some specialized institutions for wayward children—that is, children who lived on the streets—arose in many cities. * By 1840, “idiocy” was widely seen as a special problem; it was even included on questionnaires of that year’s census. No consensus existed about its precise causes; some reformers believed it stemmed from lack of willpower, whereas medical theories implicated physiological factors. Like orphans and neglected children, “feebleminded” people were often housed in poorhouses and mental institutions until reformers determined to wrest them away. Once in a specialized institution, children and adults were placed under a rigorous regimen of training, both to increase their willpower and to impart skills that would make them productive laborers. Early reformers hoped that, with careful training, the inmates might eventually leave the institution; but, by the latter part of the 19th century, superintendents had lowered their goals merely to training the inmates to perform various duties within the institution, where most spent the remainder of their lives. * These various institutional approaches, including prisons, mental institutions, orphanages, homes for wayward children, and houses of refuge, achieved considerable success at first—at least compared with what had preceded them. By placing children in houses of refuge, reformers kept them away from hardened criminals in the prison population; by placing children in orphanages, reformers separated them from destitute adults in poorhouses. Prisons became public institutions that possessed a rehabilitation strategy, and persons with mental disorders were rescued from workhouses. Initially blessed with relatively low staff-to-resident ratios, these institutions could provide individualized and intensive services. Because they existed in a society that was generally indifferent to the fate of criminals, persons with mental disorders, or delinquent youth, however, the institutions did not receive sufficient public funding to sustain these intensive and ameliorative services. Furthermore, politicians were unwilling to divert scarce public resources to institutions when funds were needed for road construction and other internal improvements in a growing society. Various institutions—particularly workhouses and prisons—were continually engulfed in scandal; superintendents were variously charged with fraud, excessive leniency, or providing contracts to political cronies. Inadequate funding often impeded moral reform, which prevented the institutions from hiring enough trained staff. In some cases, superintendents came to see that it was in their professional interest if residents were institutionalized for the remainder of their lives because the superintendents could then petition for additional funds on the grounds that they lacked sufficient space for their inmate population. Public authorities, desperate for places to put older people who could not survive in independent living arrangements and who lacked relatives to care for them, often placed them in large numbers in mental institutions or even poorhouses; the result was to overwhelm the staffs of these organizations. * An articulate if idiosyncratic dissenter from the institutional consensus emerged in the 1850s. Charles Loring Brace founded and then became director of the private Children’s Aid Society of New York. Brace believed that street urchins and other vagabond children were intrinsically creative but that their natural virtues became stifled when they were placed in institutions. Contending that low-income and immigrant families were often as oppressive as institutions, he took the dramatic step of sending over 90,000 of these children to live with families on or near the frontier between 1853 and 1895. Brace remains a controversial figure; whereas some people believed he was rescuing the children from poverty and from oppressive families, critics argued that the children were placed with families who had been inadequately screened and who used them as unpaid farm labor. Few Americans in this era joined Brace in arguing against the use of institutions that sought to radically reform their residents through a prescribed and rigorous regimen. * The reformers of the early and mid 19th century can be criticized for believing institutions to be a panacea, but they often responded with compassion to the plight of children begging on the streets, criminal offenders incarcerated in brutish settings, and persons with mental disorders who were bound in chains. In considering alternatives, we should not quickly conclude that deinstitutionalization is a panacea. We see its consequences in contemporary society, where persons with psychiatric disorders are released to the community without adequate housing, income, or medical and social services; children are placed in inferior foster homes; and homeless people are left to lead dangerous and degrading lives on public streets. Like the institutions of the 19th century, poor funding and inadequate staffing today often sabotage community-based programs (see Insert 4.5 ). Insert 4.5. Critical Analysis: Why Didn’t the 19th-Century Reformers Seek Community- Based Solutions? 1. In contemporary society, we take for granted such community- based programs as foster care for children, halfway houses for persons with psychiatric disorders, or independent living centers for persons with physical disabilities. We can hardly imagine a society where social services focused on placing people into institutions, whether through voluntary or involuntary commitments. Why didn’t reformers in the 19th century seek community-based programs? In answering this question, consider such factors as: Their views of pathology compared with ours Their views of civil rights or liberties compared with ours The extent that their society possessed staff and program expertise to implement community-based programs 2. Although no one would like to return to institutional domination of the human services, discuss what roles institutions can legitimately assume even in contemporary society. (Try to be specific, giving examples of kinds of persons who might benefit from institutional care for varying lengths of time.) Identify Opportunity-Enhancing Policies EP 7b In the early and mid 19th century, America extended suffrage to most white males, developed public schools, and distributed land to many settlers. Americans in the 20th century take these institutions and policies for granted, but they represented major—even unimaginable—reforms to Europeans. In Europe, during the first half of the 19th century, suffrage was extended only to persons with considerable property, education was restricted to affluent persons who could afford tuition, and land was not widely distributed. Cambridge University refused to fill a position in American studies with an American scholar in the 1840s because its officials feared he would discuss universal suffrage. * No system of public education existed in the United States in 1800, but by 1860 the nation possessed a national network of primary and secondary schools. This massive growth in public education, which extended to girls as well, represented a major policy advance in the 19th century. Four systems of education existed prior to these reforms: private tutors, boarding schools, day schools that were run by various sects, and charity schools that gave free education to the urban poor. Those who did not want high taxes and who believed that education should be provided by the family or by religious sects had staunchly resisted Thomas Jefferson and other colonial leaders who had espoused free public education. Several rationales for publicly funded education emerged by the 1820s and gathered momentum in succeeding decades. An uneducated citizenry, educational reformers LO 4-6 argued, would not be able to participate in American democracy, which could lead to tyranny, mob rule, and other evils. In short, much like founders of other institutions in this period, they defined education as a moral enterprise that would teach youth moral rules and so allow them to avoid poverty, alcoholism, and crime. Many people viewed public education as a method of assimilating Irish immigrants into American culture. Some reformers, noting uneasily the strikes and protests of the period, favored public education as a means of controlling the populace; Ralph Waldo Emerson, the noted author, declared, “You must educate them to keep them from our throats.” Some persons also realized that a literate workforce was needed if America was to develop an industrial economy. Thanks to the rise of public education in the 19th century, more than one- half of white children between the ages of 5 and 19 were enrolled in schools in 1850. * Crusades to end imprisonment for debt represented one of the major social reform movements of the 19th century. Previously, many Americans who had incurred large debts to start farms and businesses had found themselves threatened with imprisonment when they fell behind in their payments. Agitation in various states led to gradual relaxing of these laws and finally to their abolition in most states by the time of the Civil War. By 1830, all white males were granted the vote in most jurisdictions. Along with suffrage came greater political participation. In presidential contests, for example, opposing candidates were variously called “atheists,” “criminals,” and “agitators.” Interest groups had already assumed prominence in American politics, as persons with similar interests found that they could obtain policy changes by joining with others, lobbying, assisting friendly legislators, and making campaign contributions (or bribes) to politicians. Political appearances could be deceiving, however. American interest group democracy, which seemed to give the common people an unprecedented role in political life, often empowered corporations and privileged persons. Fearing that one faction could dominate American politics, Jefferson and many of the colonial leaders had constructed elaborate checks and balances to prevent this possibility, but these safeguards did not prevent specific interest groups from gaining enormous power. By the latter half of the 19th century, industrial tycoons dominated the politics of the nation, just as land speculators and agricultural interests possessed considerable power in the antebellum period. * Radical Movements: Conspicuous by Their Absence Although, as we have seen, Americans pioneered opportunity-enhancing policies, comparisons between England and the United States during the 1830s and 1840s suggest that the United States provided an environment hostile to social reform. England was hardly kind to poor people and those with mental disorders, but a relatively strong (by American standards) political mobilization of the lower class known as Chartism developed in the late 1830s. In his classic work on the English working class, G. D. H. Cole contends that Chartism arose partly from discontent when advocates of poorhouses insisted on building them even during a marked downturn in the economy, but its leaders quickly embraced universal male suffrage, equal electoral districts, annual Parliaments, payment of legislators, secret ballots, and removal of property qualifications for legislators. To support these working-class demands, 150 local groups were quickly organized. They sent huge petitions to Parliament urging their measures; one was over 6 miles long and was signed by more than 3 million people, at a time when the population of Britain numbered only 19 million. While often split by schisms over tactics and their precise program, many chartists broadened their demands in the 1840s to include the repeal of tariffs on corn, demands for a 10-hour day, more humane treatment of people in workhouses, development of free education, factory regulations, and legislation to strengthen unions. * Poor persons and laborers were more organized in England than in the United States for several reasons. First, many American workers, such as Irish Americans, tended to identify with their ethnic groups and often did not identify with or organize around their social class. Second, prejudice often splintered workers; for example, white Protestant workers tended to be suspicious of Irish Catholic workers. Third, partly because the federal government was so weak, Americans focused on local issues such as securing city jobs, garbage collection, and other amenities rather than on national economic and social policies. Fourth, American workers probably regarded poor relief as primarily relevant to paupers (i.e., to nonworkers), whereas English workers viewed poor law institutions as relevant to working-class interests. * Finally, more dissent and argument existed in England about the causes and nature of poverty. Many English people subscribed to the moralistic and individualistic explanations that were widely accepted by Americans, but some English theorists and citizens emphasized economic and social factors that perpetuated pauperism and poverty. However, the former group, led by Edwin Chadwick, controlled an influential commission whose findings in 1834 recommended that indoor relief and punitive policies replace the relatively generous poor relief that existed in many parts of England. Convinced that nonpunitive administration of the poor laws harmed the economy and drained the public treasury by enticing many people not to work, Chadwick was determined to enforce a harsh workhouse regimen. (He found particularly abhorrent the Speenhamland system of relief in the 1820s, where local poor relief officials actually supplemented the wages of working people in the community whenever the price of bread rose above a certain amount—a policy that suggested that people ought to have a guaranteed income even if they worked in low-wage jobs.) Chadwick’s harsh policies were sharply questioned by those who saw industrialization, recessions, low wages, and inflation as the primary causes of dependency. Some reformers even proposed health insurance and old-age pensions for the poor. Reformers found assistance from some aristocrats and the English Conservative party; Benjamin Disraeli and other Conservative leaders assumed attitudes befitting the heirs to the feudal nobles, who had provided assistance to serfs during hard times. * Given this contrast between the United States and England, with its more vital radical traditions, it remained to be seen whether Americans could couple their extraordinary interest in facilitating economic, educational, and political opportunity with compassion for persons who were less successful than others. Compassion existed, but it often took the form of relatively harsh, condescending, or moralistic assistance to poor persons who were incessantly accused of causing their own plight by insufficient application or virtue. Ominously, the working class in the United States was poorly organized, when contrasted to European nations, and so provided uncertain pressure for the development of social welfare programs. Analyze the Oppression of V ulnerable Populations or Outgroups in the Early Republic EP 2a EP 3a In the 18th century, as we have seen, the American colonists lived in a triracial society that included white settlers, African Americans, and Native Americans. As the 19th century unfolded, Americans encountered other indigenous populations; in the Southwest portion of the continent, for example, they met Spanish-speaking people who lived in areas that became part of Mexico after its independence from Spain in 1821. Moreover, significant numbers of Asians from China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines emigrated to the United States to work in agriculture and construction projects in the latter part of the 19th century. We also need to discuss white ethnic minorities, particularly the Irish, whose Catholicism, as well as their sheer numbers and poverty, exposed them to the ire of the white Protestant population even before the Civil War. And we must extend our analysis of the policies, laws, and culture that affected women in the colonial period to the first seven decades of the new republic. We discuss the oppression of Irish immigrants and women in this chapter, as well as some emerging policies toward sexual matters that had important implications for women and persons who deviated from commonly accepted sexual norms. (We discuss the oppression of African slaves, LO 4-7 Native Americans, Asian immigrants, and Spanish-speaking persons later in this chapter.) Oppression of W omen The doctrine of separate spheres, which had emerged in the colonial period, grew stronger in the early 19th century and led to the cult of domesticity, which consigned women to household and familial functions while reserving the professions and business to males. The economic roles of women were further constrained by the increasing importance attached to child rearing. Although children in the colonial period had often been regarded as little adults who were to begin full-time work at the age of 11, they were increasingly viewed as requiring extended moral education and socialization within the family. Although this child rearing could have been shared equally by both parents, Americans in the early 19th century developed the notion that women were uniquely equipped to perform this function. Sometimes perceived as immoral temptresses in the colonial period, women came to be portrayed as morally superior to men—and consequently as best suited to inculcate moral character into the nation’s youth. Married women were urged to devote themselves to raising children and to administering their households; they had few rights to own or manage property, except in those cases where their husbands predeceased them. Almost no married women from the middle or upper classes worked outside their households, and even many working-class women sought to avoid external work. (Female slaves were given no choice.) Widowed women often encountered bleak realities. As in the colonial period, husbands often left the bulk of their estates to their children, so that widows were left to fend for themselves; to survive, they might rent out rooms in their homes, which were often occupied, as well, by one or more of their children, who now owned the house. High rates of male mortality meant that 32% of adult women and 61% of women over the age of 60 were widows in the 1850s. * The prohibition against labor did not extend to single women, who often worked as domestic and live-in servants. Working conditions for servants were hard: low wages, only 1 day off each week, and often harsh treatment by employers. Partly because they wanted more independence, some single women found work in factories in New England, where they worked long hours at low pay, but factory jobs were not plentiful; the nation did not industrialize in a major way until after the Civil War. Women were virtually excluded from medicine, law, and the clergy, though growing numbers of them became schoolteachers (as public education became more common) and, after the Civil War, nurses. * But seeds of discontent and protest were finally sown in 1848 at a convention in Seneca Falls, New York, which issued a Declaration of Sentiments modeled after the Declaration of Independence. The 68 women and 32 men who signed it declared, “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal” and “have the duty to throw off such government” that visits on them “a long train of abuses and usurpation.” In this remarkable and prescient document, the signers attacked the cult of domesticity and the prevalent notion that women were intellectually and legally inferior to men; they demanded suffrage, access to the professions, and legal rights—such as the ability to hold property while married. The Seneca Falls Convention was followed by similar conferences, roughly one each year, between 1849 and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. Historians have identified various reasons why feminism arose in this period. The cult of domesticity, which virtually imprisoned women in their homes, subjected them to so much boredom and so many restrictions that a vanguard of women protested. Moreover, many women became leaders in the budding abolitionist movement, which fostered women’s rights in several ways. As they worked to end slavery, which represented an incongruity between the equal rights doctrines of the nation and its practices, women came to recognize a similar incongruity between these doctrines and their own limited legal and social roles. Furthermore, many women experienced discrimination in their work for abolition, both from male abolitionists (who sought to limit them to background roles) and from the public (who often objected to any woman speaking in public). Also, more women were receiving the rudiments of education in a growing number of high schools and academies for women—and Oberlin became the first college to admit women in 1837. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, along with fellow feminists, engaged in policy advocacy efforts that were 60 or more years ahead of her time (see Insert 4.6 ). Her policy advocacy illustrates key tensions and challenges that are encountered by any policy advocate who engages in tasks identified in Figure 2.1 . It was grounded in her moral outrage at the blatant contradiction between the affirmation of the rights of men in the Declaration of Independence and the outright ignoring of the rights of women . Are we not, she asked, all members of the human species, and do not we all deserve equal treatment under the law and in such pursuits as education, the professions, and business? Why, she asked, should women be deprived of the right to vote when their views should hold equal weight to those of men? Why should women be placed in separate classes from men in some educational institutions? Imagine, in turn, her moral outrage when women were betrayed by many male abolitionists and public officials who had promised to include female suffrage in constitutional amendments in the wake of the Civil War—not just because this was a morally correct policy but to repay the legions of women who had participated in abolitionism. Imagine, too, her outrage when even the Bible , widely viewed as sacrosanct by Christians, used blatantly sexist language—leading her to author The Woman’s Bible as a nonsexist alternative. Insert 4.6. Proﬁles in Policy Practice and Advocacy: Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815–1902) Elizabeth Cady Stanton—an American suffragist, reformer, and the leading philosopher of the 19th-century feminist movement—is best remembered for her leadership in the crusade to free women from the legal and social obstacles that prevented them from achieving equality with men. She was born in Johnstown, New York, on November 12, 1815, the seventh of 10 children born to Daniel Cady, a farmer turned successful lawyer, and Margaret (Livingston) Cady, the daughter of one of the oldest and wealthiest families in New York. Stanton’s life and thoughts were most influenced by a tragedy that occurred when she was 11 years old. Her only brother, described by Stanton as “a young man of great talent and promise,” died in 1826 due to an illness. The death of her brother devastated her father, who held his son very dear to his heart. Stanton, many years later, recalled that her father said to her, “Oh, my daughter, I wish you were a boy!” The young Stanton responded, “I will try to be all my brother was.” Thus her brother’s death and her desire to fill the emotional void left in her father’s life became a powerful force in the creation of Stanton’s identity. Stanton immediately set out to prove that she could match her brother’s abilities. She decided to do this by studying Greek and learning how to manage horses. She excelled in both equestrian skill and the classics. Stanton’s only wish was that her father would recognize her achievements and allow her to assume the place formerly held by her brother. He never did. Instead, after showing her father an award she won in a Greek competition against a group of boys, her father kissed her and said with a sigh, “Ah, you should have been a boy!” Stanton longed to attend Union College in Schenectady, New York, where her brother had studied. Instead, her parents enrolled her at Emma Willard’s Seminary in Troy, New York, an exclusive school for women. Stanton was angry that she could not attend college with her male counterparts and argued that single-sex education was a mistake. Though she strongly disapproved of her situation, she remained at the seminary from 1830 to 1832. Stanton’s exposure to the reform movements of her era came through visits to the home of her cousin, abolitionist Gerrit Smith of Peterboro, New York. It was during one of these visits that the young Elizabeth Cady met and was attracted to Henry B. Stanton, an abolitionist 10 years her senior. In May 1840, despite her father’s objections, the couple was married in a ceremony from which the promise to obey was omitted. While on their honeymoon, the newlyweds attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. There, Stanton met Quaker abolitionist and women’s rights advocate Lucretia Mott. The two shared their anger over the fact that women delegates were prohibited from speaking and voting at the convention. They left the convention determined to hold a women’s rights convention and form a women’s rights organization as soon as they returned to America. Their plans were put on hold for eight years. Meanwhile, Stanton gave birth to her first three children (she gave birth to a total of seven) and moved to Seneca Falls, New York, with her husband. On July 19 and 20, 1848, the first women’s rights convention was held in Seneca Falls. At the convention, Stanton presented a draft of a Declaration of Sentiments, which declared that women were equal to men. She also proposed a resolution asking for the American woman’s right to vote. Her resolution was the first in a long crusade for women’s suffrage. It was adopted by the convention. Shortly thereafter, Stanton began writing articles on women’s rights and the suffrage movement for Amelia Bloomer’s temperance paper, The Lily. During this same period, she also took to wearing a short skirt over her trousers, as publicized by Bloomer. It was through Bloomer that Stanton was introduced to Susan B. Anthony in 1851. Together, Stanton and Anthony worked on women’s rights issues for nearly half a century. They worked well together. Stanton, who was a strong speaker and excellent writer, produced the correspondence and delivered speeches, and Anthony, who was a good organizer and campaigner, did her part to arrange conferences and establish networks throughout the women’s rights movement. In 1860, Stanton became the first woman to formally address a joint session of the New York State legislature, where she advocated a stronger married women’s property bill, which was subsequently approved. Later that year, she shook up the audience at the national women’s rights convention by proposing a set of liberalized divorce laws. With the onset of the Civil War, Stanton’s attention was directed back to the abolition of slavery. Together with Susan B. Anthony, she organized the Women’s Loyal National League in 1863. The league’s purpose was to launch a massive petition campaign to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment. Following the end of the war, however, Stanton opposed both the 14th and 15th Amendments because they extended civil rights and franchise only to African American males while excluding women. Her determination to reform society’s view of women and their role in U.S. politics drove her to run for Congress in 1866. Unfortunately, she was not elected. In 1868, Stanton and Anthony began publishing Revolution , a women’s rights weekly distributed in New York City. Stanton often contributed editorials in support of the right to vote, greater employment opportunities for women, and a woman’s right to serve on juries. In 1869, the two also founded the National Woman Suffrage Association, which had as its main goal the passage of a federal women’s suffrage amendment. Elizabeth Stanton served as president of this organization for the next 20 years. Also in 1869, Stanton began touring the country, giving lectures on women’s issues. She was quickly becoming a popular speaker and widely respected authority on the women’s rights movement. In 1871, Stanton and Anthony campaigned for women’s suffrage in California. Stanton was called on regularly to address congressional committees on issues related to women’s rights in general and the federal suffrage amendment in particular. In 1895, Elizabeth Cady Stanton was honored when New York City officials declared her birthday “Stanton Day”; at least 6,000 people gathered at the Metropolitan Opera House in her honor. In that same year, remaining true to her controversial nature, Stanton released The Woman’s Bible , in which she corrected what she believed was a degrading view of women in the standard Holy Bible. Attacks were launched at both her and the book by clergy, the press, and many of her colleagues in the suffrage movement. Ever tenacious, Stanton continued to transmit her views on religion, divorce, and women’s rights issues in newspaper and magazine articles. Several of her last efforts were aimed at securing the support of President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1898, she moved to New York City, where she lived until her death in August of 1902. A powerful and emotional epitaph was offered by Susan B. Anthony: “Well, it is an awful hush.” Elizabeth Cady Stanton also had to develop sophisticated navigational skills as she and other feminists decided whether to focus on getting suffrage for women through the states or through a federal constitutional amendment (see Figure 2.1 ). This navigational issue split the suffrage movement into two factions as the American Women’s Suffrage Association approached state legislatures to change their constitutions to allow women to vote while the National Women’s Suffrage Association sought a broader range of reforms for women including a federal constitutional amendment. This split between the two suffrage associations illustrates a tension that all policy advocates encounter: whether to seek half a loaf or a full loaf— which, in turn, reflects one’s ultimate goals. Feminist pragmatists in the wake of the Civil War diagnosed the context to indicate that rampant sexism in the United States precluded a federal constitutional amendment because most voting men simply would not abide universal suffrage. Other feminists were determined to go straight for a complete victory through a federal constitutional amendment even if this tactic would likely mean defeats in the short term. No easy solution exists to this tension between pragmatism (which did lead to 12 states enacting universal suffrage by 1917) and idealism (which eventually did bring the 19th Amendment to the federal Constitution in 1920, granting women the right to vote). But we should not imply that the women who subscribed to feminism in this period, such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, represented the mainstream of female (or male) thought at the time. Indeed, many avant-garde women were content to seek access to the professions and to positions in teaching within the old framework of separate spheres and the cult of domesticity and did not agree with “radical feminists” who sought an array of public and political reforms. (We note later in this chapter how male abolitionists mostly abandoned women in the wake of the Civil War by refusing to include them in constitutional amendments designed to give the freed slaves certain civil and legal rights.) * Women’s freedom was also constricted by the lack of effective birth control in the colonial period. In 1800, each married woman had an average of 6.4 children; with so many children, women could not easily pursue their independent interests. Moreover, many women died during childbirth or from the toll of successive pregnancies. A remarkable decline in the number of children per family took place in the 19th century. Although it is common for birthrates to decline when nations industrialize, birthrates plummeted in the United States in unprecedented fashion for an agricultural society—to 4.9 children per married woman by 1850 and to 2.8 children by 1880. Historians do not fully understand this development. Various explanations have been suggested. One incentive for women to limit family size—particularly in the wake of the Civil War, when the nation rapidly industrialized—was that larger investments of effort were required to prepare children for the labor force in an urban society than when they were laborers on family farms. Another factor was that, by the end of the 19th century, many Americans viewed sex as a reflection of romantic love, in contrast to the predominant colonial attitude that sex was a utilitarian, procreative enterprise, a means of having children. In addition, Americans’ extraordinary emphasis on moral qualities in the 19th century prompted interest in the control of sexual activity. The remarkable reductions in birthrates could not have occurred, however, without greater use of contraception. While women had long resorted to a small range of unreliable techniques—the use of sponges, douches, coitus interruptus, and abstinence during the most fertile portion of the menstrual cycle—they gained access to vulcanized rubber condoms and diaphragms after mid century. Though available primarily by word of mouth and through vaguely worded advertisements, these techniques probably assumed larger roles in limiting families as the century progressed. * Of course, women’s (and men’s) freedom to control procreation could be limited by public policies. Named after Anthony Comstock, its sponsor, the Comstock Law of 1873 outlawed the circulation of contraceptive information and devices through the U.S. mails because of fear that the use of contraceptives would excessively limit the growth of the American population. Comstock, who worked for the U.S. Postal Service, devoted the next four decades to prosecuting purveyors of “obscenity,” including physicians who openly dispensed contraceptives. (In addition, many local jurisdictions enacted obscenity laws that were used by the early 20th century, along with the Comstock Law, to prosecute feminists who sought to openly discuss contraception or to distribute birth control devices.) Moreover, by the late 19th century, many physicians opposed abortion. Before the Civil War, abortion had been used without stigma to limit family size, even if it relied on herbs and other uncertain techniques, but physicians increasingly came to see it as an unnatural curtailing of women’s reproductive function. * Nor did public policies target only birth control devices. Homosexuality was not stigmatized in the 19th century, though various localities had laws against sodomy (sexual intercourse between men). But by the end of the century (when the term homosexuality was first coined), physicians had declared that same-gender sexual relations represented medical pathology; this development presaged the stigmatizing of such behavior in the 20th century. * Oppression of Irish Immigrants Some contemporary writers wrongly imply that white ethnic populations, such as the Irish immigrants, assimilated to their new land with ease and with minor discrimination from the dominant population. In fact, the Irish, whose numbers in America increased dramatically in the decade after the potato famine that lasted between 1845 and 1849, illustrate the nature and extent of problems that white, low-income, ethnic immigrants encountered in the new nation. (The problems of the Irish were later experienced by millions of Italian, Jewish, and Eastern European immigrants in the period from 1870 to 1924.) With the advantage of hindsight, we can see that Ireland was a nation courting disaster in the decades before 1845. Its population consisted of millions of impoverished farmers, whose numbers had so greatly increased in the 70 years before the potato famine that Ireland was the most densely populated nation in Europe. Many Irish peasants lived in degrading poverty, often as tenants to absentee landowners or as owners of small plots of less than 5 acres. This agrarian and impoverished society depended for its survival on the potato—a crop that had been introduced to Europe from South America and that provided extraordinary nourishment for its burgeoning population. Even a few acres of this easily grown crop sufficed to feed a family the bulk of its diet. Although there had been periodic and small famines, no one was prepared for the widespread potato rot in 1845, which devastated the crop on which the nation depended. Imbued with the doctrines of laissez-faire economics, the British government responded to the catastrophe with sublime confidence that market mechanisms would suffice to improve Ireland’s depleted food supply. The government’s plan was simply to buy stocks of corn and, by periodically selling some of its reserve, to keep the market price of corn at a level that the Irish peasants could afford. Moreover, the government hoped that relatively modest increases in Poor Law relief would tide the peasants over until the ensuing year when, it was assumed, the potato harvest would return to normal. * Tragically, the plant disease that devastated the harvest in 1845 continued to attack the crops during the next four years. About 750,000 persons, or nearly one-eighth of the population, died of starvation or disease. Cecil Woodham-Smith notes unimaginable horrors: At a farm in Caheragh, County Cork, a woman and her two children were found dead and half-eaten by dogs; in a neighboring cottage five more corpses … were lying … Father John O’Sullivan … found a room full of dead people; a man, still living, was lying in bed with a dead wife and two dead children, while a starving cat was eating another dead infant. * People weakened by malnutrition succumbed to mass infections like typhoid fever and dysentery in a nation with only 28 hospitals. A number of factors—crop failures in other parts of Europe; British hatred of the Irish; prevailing notions of limited government; British insistence on financing poor relief from taxes levied on the already impoverished Irish citizens; and punitive responses to widespread riots in the Irish countryside—prevented the use of humane policies to address the emergency. Roughly 1.5 million Irish peasants sought refuge in the United States from 1845 to 1854, in what was merely the start of a long-term migration from Ireland. Driven by poverty, hatred of landlords, and a desire to join relatives in America, another two and one-half million immigrants had reached the United States by 1900. Of course, this reprieve from starvation and hardship required funds for steamship passage, which were often obtained by selling family heirlooms. Moreover, many people died in passage from various diseases. Once in the new land, the Irish soon encountered misfortune on a scale just short of the starvation that they had escaped. American authorities sometimes turned ships away, on the grounds that passengers were too diseased. Anti-Catholic, anti-Irish, and anti-immigrant sentiments often sparked riots against the émigrés. As unskilled peasants with no capital and no knowledge of the agricultural techniques needed to develop larger farms on the frontier, most of the Irish immigrants moved to Eastern and Midwestern cities, where they lived in appalling poverty in low-income ghettos. They could perform only unskilled tasks such as cleaning stables, unloading boats, and pushing carts; women found work as domestics. In a land with few regulations, they occupied shantytowns built by speculators; as many as nine people lived in a single room, and many were crowded into cellars. Cholera epidemics swept through these low-income areas; indeed, one report suggests that, in some Irish communities, more than half of the children died and the average age of persons buried was less than 15. Other Irish became the labor force for companies and governments building railroads, roads, and canals. Still others became the labor force for coal mines. * Soon, considerable numbers of the Irish occupied American poorhouses and jails. Irish immigrants commonly took to whiskey to forget their troubles, and alcoholism as well as poverty led to high rates of crime. Protestant Americans believed they were being overrun and often responded with hatred. (Indeed, in 1847 alone, 37,000 Irish immigrants arrived in Boston, a city that had only 115,000 residents in 1845.) In the 1850s, a potent Know Nothing movement argued that Catholics represented a menace to American national and Protestant identity and that Catholics would dilute the pure “Anglo-Saxon” racial stock of America. Hatred of Catholics spawned the American Political Party, which elected six governors in the 1850s. As Higham notes, nativism was an important ingredient in American public life between 1860 and 1925; always simmering, it boiled over again in the 1890s and in the period from 1905 to 1924. * Subjected to discrimination and encountering dire poverty, the Irish immigrants developed remarkable strategies for coping with their environment. They quickly discovered that they could use politics to enhance their well-being, simply by exercising their massive voting power in local elections. In cities such as Boston in the latter part of the 19th century, they were able to elect a succession of Irish mayors, who helped them get jobs, protected them from discrimination and violence, and approved community improvements. The Catholic Church became a prime benefactor, as well, by underwriting charities and helping them form social, athletic, and community groups. Like succeeding waves of immigrants from other nations, the Irish formed tightly knit urban enclaves, both to protect themselves and to evolve community institutions to advance their collective fortunes. * Examine Precursors of the Reluctant W elfare State Many Americans viewed the social problems of the new nation as a pestilence that threatened its moral and social order. Social problems were generally viewed as emanating from the moral defects of citizens—and particularly immigrants in the burgeoning cities. Reformers, correspondingly, tried to develop institutions that could purge these defects from stigmatized groups—people with mental disorders, criminals, paupers, and delinquent youth—or sought preventive strategies, which included temperance and moral instruction through the Sunday School movement or the expanding network of public schools. In short, the services available to citizens who needed assistance were harsh and controlling. Relatively few reformers acknowledged that structural factors—such as the nation’s uncertain economy, the blighted conditions of its cities, or discrimination against its immigrants—assumed a major role in causing social problems. The lack of strong reform and political organizations that represented the policy needs of the lower class, such as were developing in England, deprived the nation of alternative perspectives. Nor did the nation develop expansive notions of social obligation; social programs, most reformers believed, should concentrate only on the provision of institutional and social services to individuals who were truly destitute and ill rather than to a broad range of its citizens. (Public education was an important exception, though even education was conceived primarily as moral instruction.) Most services were, moreover, to be provided by local governments and private philanthropic organizations; Americans accorded the federal government virtually no social welfare roles other than maintenance of some institutions for the deaf and a small program of pensions for veterans. LO 4-8 Social Policy at the Frontier Life on the American frontier has been romanticized in countless films and books. In reality, while many white settlers—along with speculators and railroad companies—became rich, others could not obtain land or were bankrupted in the volatile swings of the frontier economy. The frontier was also the stage for the persecution of Native Americans, Spanish-speaking persons, and other groups. Land Policy In the early and mid 19th century, most of the unsettled land in the United States was in territories owned by the federal government. Federal authorities had to decide on an appropriate policy: whether to give land to settlers, to allow persons to buy unlimited quantities of land, to sell or give the land to churches and other organizations, or (most radically) to distribute the land to former slaves, Native Americans, impoverished immigrants, urban dwellers, and squatters. The basic strategy for distributing the land, which was developed by the 1780s, was to sell it in blocks at public auctions to the highest bidders, provided their bids exceeded a prescribed minimum price. The advantages of this strategy, from the government’s point of view, were that public auction of vast quantities of unsettled land would most likely keep land prices relatively low, would avoid the large public bureaucracies required if the government were to distribute land directly to individuals, and would conform to the tenets of capitalism, which governed the distribution of American lands almost from the beginning of the national experience. Tens of millions of acres were sold at federal land offices between 1790 and 1890, when the frontier no longer existed. Far from proving equitable, however, the auctions often enriched relatively affluent Americans, speculators, and railroad companies. Competitive bidding at auctions tended to favor already wealthy persons who had recently sold their farms in settled areas. Believing that railroad lines through the territories would stimulate economic growth, the federal government gave (or sold at minimum prices) vast tracts to the railroad companies, which then sold the land to settlers—at inflated prices. Speculators and land companies soon discovered how to manipulate the auction system. Using scouts and information leaked by officials at federal land offices, they located valuable farmland and other lands, made mutual agreements not to engage in competitive bidding, and secured large tracts at the minimum federal price, which they later sold at higher prices to settlers. * It is a myth that the frontier was largely sold to farmhands, poor immigrants, or poor urban dwellers. A large class of squatters settled frontier lands without titles, as they lacked funds to purchase them; they grew several crops on the land before moving westward to renew the process. The federal government periodically tried to help squatters and persons of limited means. Many “preemption laws” allowed squatters to purchase their land at the federal auctions. Furthermore, to help poorer persons buy land, federal authorities successively lowered the minimum sizes of land blocks from 320 to 160 to 40 acres and decreased the required down payment. But these policies were insufficient to make land ownership possible for many squatters and other would-be settlers. Relatively little land was distributed to freed slaves in the wake of the Civil War, and land was not widely used for charitable institutions, aside from land grant colleges. * Settlers’ problems were compounded by inadequate regulation of the frontier banks that financed land purchases. In the absence of sufficient federal currency, notes of local banks were used as currency, but their value fluctuated wildly in periodic recessions or when the banks had to repay their foreign creditors. President Jackson’s veto of the United States Bank in 1832 compounded the economic turmoil. The frontier also provided rich opportunities for deception and fraud. Speculators, railroads, and steamship companies hired salesmen who, with promises of fertile American lands, would persuade European peasants to part with their life savings in exchange for a plot of barren land in a remote location. By hiring persons to falsely claim squatting rights, speculators were able to buy land at minimum prices. Federal land agents often gave information about choice lands to speculators for a fee—and participated freely in land speculation. * Discuss the Conquest and Oppression of Native Americans and Spanish-Speaking Persons EP 1a EP 2a EP 3a During the colonial period, prejudice against Native Americans was softened by the condescending belief that the destructive influence of tribal customs made them lazy. In the 19th century, such environmental explanations of the differences between Native Americans and whites were increasingly supplanted by unmitigated racism, which promoted vicious suppression of Native Americans and Spanish-speaking persons on the frontier. American anthropologists became convinced that white persons from England and Germany, whom they called Anglo-Saxons, were biologically superior to other races in intelligence and industriousness. They went on to argue that this supposed superiority had allowed Anglo-Saxons to conquer indigenous persons, develop new technology, and establish democratic and legal institutions. Unlike many colonial theorists, who assumed that Native Americans shared common biological origins with whites, these anthropologists contended that Anglo-Saxons derived from a biological stock different from that of other races (see Insert 4.7 ). * LO 4-9 Insert 4.7.

Also read the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and discuss why Americans decided to exclude people from this nation from their land. Scientists have since disproved these theories of biological superiority. They have shown that all human races derived from ancestors in Africa or Asia—something that 19th-century anthropologists would have found disconcerting—and that there is no significant difference in brain size between races. * Racist ideas that placed Anglo-Saxons on a biological pedestal were nonetheless widely accepted in the 19th century and were linked to nationalism through the concept of manifest destiny , a term coined by Democratic politician John O’Sullivan in 1845. According to the doctrine of manifest destiny, God willed Anglo-Saxons to develop the North American continent as a laboratory to show the world that Americans could build a Utopian society that fused capitalism, Protestantism, and democracy. Anthropologists and politicians argued that indigenous peoples who blocked the expansion of the frontier should be violently suppressed and that Anglo-Saxons should not dilute their stock by marrying members of other racial groups. * In the colonial period, the frontier had been circumscribed by territorial claims of the Spanish and the French, by the determination of the English Crown to limit settlers’ advance on some Native American lands (see the discussion of the Proclamation Line in Chapter 3 ), and by the tenacity of Native American tribes, whose resistance to the advance of white settlers was often effective. By the early 19th century, with the departure of the European powers and with huge increases in the numbers of white settlers, the balance of power at the frontier shifted toward the settlers who, moreover, continued to make use of their advanced weapons, their ability to play tribes off against each other, and their willingness to entice or force tribal leaders to sign treaties. What’s more, the unexpected acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from the French in 1803 opened up a frontier extending from the Mississippi to the Pacific, with the exception of huge Spanish territories on the Southwestern and Western parts of the continent. (Those territories became part of Mexico when it gained independence from Spain in 1821.) When Jefferson negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, he had the notion that Native Americans should live on small tracts of land in their existing territories (with the remaining lands to be sold to white settlers by federal land agents). However, he came to adopt a “removal policy,” which would relocate most Native Americans who lived west of the Mississippi to lands far from the existing frontier. This relocation policy was anathema to many Native American leaders, such as the legendary Tecumseh, who tried over some decades to organize an effective resistance by tribes in the Ohio Valley and the South. But the push of the white settlers was inexorable; often under force of arms, tribal leaders (or those cooperative individuals identified as leaders by white officials) ceded vast tracts to the American government. Those few federal officials who sought to protect land granted to Native Americans by these treaties had little success in restraining settlers from occupying the land and brutalizing the Native Americans who lived there. * Even those Native Americans who chose to become farmers were displaced as the frontier moved westward. Consider the Cherokees, who farmed lands in Georgia. Many Cherokees signed treaties with federal authorities that guaranteed tribal jurisdiction over certain lands and declared their statehood independent of Georgia, so as to forestall efforts to take their land. Some politicians resisted their removal and cited treaty obligations, but the Georgia legislators declared the Cherokees to be merely tenants who could be evicted and removed to Western territories. (Georgia invited its citizens to plunder the Cherokees and enacted legislation that made it illegal for Cherokees to testify in court against white men who took their property!) In desperation, the Cherokees appealed to President Jackson, who promptly ruled that the issue was a state matter; Jackson strongly supported the congressional “removal legislation” that was enacted in 1830. The Cherokees then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that, as a foreign power, Georgia could not violate their land claims. Though showing some sympathy to them, the Supreme Court ruled the Cherokees to be merely a “domestic dependent nation” that could not claim to be a foreign power; as such, the Court argued, the Cherokees lacked jurisdiction. When a subsequent Supreme Court ruling was more favorable, President Andrew Jackson simply ignored it; Cherokees were rounded up into stockades and forcibly marched to territories in an area that later became the state of Oklahoma. It has been estimated that as many as 45% of the tribe died of starvation or disease during this forced exodus. Similar policies were used to evict other large Southern tribes such as the Choctaws, the Chickasaws, and the Creeks; the Seminoles in Florida were pushed into swampy and undesirable lands that became their reservations. Tribes in the Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois areas were similarly removed to the West, often under treaties that promised that their Western lands would be kept intact for them for “perpetuity.” By the end of the 1830s, then, many displaced tribes existed in territories west of the Mississippi, in areas that later became Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Texas. Other tribes were confined to relatively small reservations in scattered locations in Florida, Minnesota, and elsewhere * ( Figure 4.3 ). Figure 4.3. Buyenlarge/Getty Images A 19th-century Native American. Settlers also dealt brutally with Spanish-speaking people on the Western frontier. The Louisiana Purchase gave most lands west of the Mississippi to the Americans but not the lands held by Spain, which became part of Mexico in 1821. White settlers found the area that became Texas to be suitable for ranching and for cotton in the 1820s and 1830s. As they pushed west and were resisted by the indigenous population, episodes of violence escalated, but the region was easy to conquer because of the political instability and weakness of Mexico. When a particular battle at the Alamo in San Antonio in 1836 was publicized as the massacre of innocent white settlers by barbaric Mexicans, many Americans supported the efforts of the white settlers to gain independence from Mexico and establish a territorial government, which became an American state in 1845. When the Mexican government refused to recognize this new state constructed from Mexican territory, the United States declared war in 1846 and, in a one-sided affair, routed the Mexicans in a series of battles that culminated in the ransacking of Mexico City in 1847. The Mexicans ceded territory that is now California, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, parts of Colorado, Wyoming, and Arizona—and they recognized the independence of Texas. In an attempt to protect the stranded Spanish- speaking persons in the ceded territory, they insisted on a provision in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that required Americans to honor the civil liberties and rights of the indigenous and Spanish-speaking population. But the provision had little effect. Spanish-speaking persons were told that their land titles, which existed under Mexican law, had to be converted to American titles; this policy led to the transfer of millions of acres of land to white settlers in Texas and then other areas that had been ceded by Mexico. (The indigenous persons lacked legal resources and access to impartial judges.) White squatters often claimed their land illegally—and land- hungry settlers massacred many indigenous Spanish-speaking persons. Landless, lacking resources, and denied civil rights and civil liberties, the Spanish-speaking population proved a useful source of labor for American ranchers and eventually for growers of vegetable and cotton crops. Large farming operations were made possible by the passage of the Reclamation Act in 1902, which provided federal funds to build an irrigation system that brought water from the Colorado River to California. Isolated from urban populations in labor camps that were organized by large owners and companies, the Spanish-speaking farm workers were brutally suppressed when they complained about their subsistence wages and harsh working conditions. * In effect, then, the settlers had engaged in three conquests by the mid 1840s: the initial development of the frontier in the colonial period, a massive relocation of Native Americans from the formation of the republic to the late 1830s, and the acquisition from the Mexicans of much of the Western and Southwestern part of the continent in the 1830s and 1840s. These conquests led to the formation of various states east of the Mississippi, as well as Texas, and paved the way for the establishment of many Southwestern states, as well as California, which became a state in 1850. But the white settlers had created a problem for themselves when they had forcibly relocated many tribes west of the Mississippi, for Native Americans now occupied vast tracts of land that white settlers desired—and some of these lands also contained minerals. A fourth conquest was needed to obtain lands that Native Americans held under treaties with the United States in areas that later became the states of Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as well as the areas ceded to the United States by Mexico, such as Colorado and California. They also had to dispossess tribes from the Badlands in what later became North and South Dakota, from the areas that became Montana and Idaho, and from their territories in the Pacific Northwest. * This fourth conquest used many of the techniques perfected earlier. Once again, tribes were induced to sign treaties by which they ceded land in exchange for minimal cash and more promises that their (now smaller) reservations would be guaranteed to them for perpetuity. Native Americans’ resistance was softened by running railroads through their lands (and thereby allowing both settlers and troops to penetrate their territory more rapidly), by mass killing of the buffalo on which they depended for sustenance, and by threats that Congress would rescind prior treaties if they failed to sign new treaties. The removal policy came to a climactic and tragic conclusion in the wake of the Civil War, when President Grant chose Civil War generals such as Sherman and Sheridan to evict Native Americans from lands west of the Mississippi. They resorted to the usual mixture of unenforced treaties and brutal assaults, but they undertook this policy with a savagery that was unmistakable in its intent: to kill all Native Americans who would not agree to settle on reservations. In 1868, thanks to the skilled tactics of Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and other Native American chiefs and warriors, the American government signed a treaty that guaranteed a huge area of the Badlands to the Sioux and Cheyenne. White settlers’ discovery of gold on those lands, however, placed enormous pressure on the government to evict the Native Americans. George Custer, a flamboyant Civil War general, was given the task of killing the Native Americans who still occupied this area. Confident that the Native Americans lacked courage to fight, he marched a small contingent directly at Native American forces numbering in the thousands—and he and his forces were killed in a battle popularly known as Custer’s Last Stand. Instead of viewing Custer’s demise as the result of the government’s illegal abrogation of its treaty with the Sioux, most white Americans sympathized with Custer, who was widely perceived as an innocent victim of savages. The Native Americans had won a Pyrrhic victory because they soon encountered the entire army of the United States, which indiscriminately attacked them; the final massacre of women, children, and men took place at Wounded Knee in 1890. In the 1870s, many public officials began a movement to break up reservations, on the grounds that tribal ownership of land represented an unnatural and communalistic experiment inconsistent with Anglo patterns of individualistic land ownership. The Dawes Act, which Congress enacted in 1887, conditioned Native Americans’ continued access to the land on their acceptance of individual plots; each head of family would be given 160 acres. Although some protections were initially established, the new policy meant that whites could take land from Native Americans, one by one, by a variety of tricks—by coercing or enticing them to sell their land for minimal prices, by using devious legal techniques to obtain title to their plots, or by arguing that Native Americans had failed to claim some of their allotments. In this way, speculators and crooks were able to liquidate vast holdings. For example, five major tribes had held an area equivalent to half the size of Oklahoma, but their holdings were reduced from 19.5 million acres in the 1850s to slightly over 300,000 acres by 1956. * Finding Laborers Americans on the Western frontier often needed to obtain labor to grow crops, to build public improvements such as railroads, and to work in mines. Many white settlers in Texas imported slaves from other sections of the South to make it a major cotton-growing region. We have already noted that, once dispossessed from the land, the Spanish-speaking population provided the major source of labor for the cultivation of cotton, fruit, and vegetables in California. Asian immigrants provided another source of labor. About 1 million Asians arrived between the gold rush of 1849 and the Immigration Act of 1924 in a complex pattern representing migrations from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and India. (Chinese and Japanese constituted the bulk of the migration.) Like European immigrants, most of the Asians came voluntarily in search of a better life, but, like slaves and Native Americans, they possessed physiological characteristics that made it easy for the white population to identify them and often to stigmatize and segregate them. The Asian influx began with Chinese immigrants, who came to America to find gold in the 1840s and to do manual labor for farmers, manufacturers, miners, and the railroads that were extending lines eastward from the Pacific. In 1870, California’s 63,000 Chinese constituted almost 10% of the state’s population. Chinese laborers were ideally suited to employers’ needs: They could be paid minimal wages (coercive tactics were used when they threatened to strike for higher wages) and used to depress the wages of white workers, and they did not constitute a political threat because as “aliens” and persons of color, they were denied legal rights. (The California Supreme Court ruled in 1854 that Chinese people could not testify in court against whites, even if one of their number had been murdered by a white citizen.) They were disallowed from owning mines by tax levies, could not become citizens, were required to attend segregated schools, and could not vote. Rampant racism and fears by white laborers that they would lose their jobs to Chinese workers led to the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which excluded further Chinese immigrants despite their usefulness to employers. Japanese labor soon provided a low-wage substitute, particularly for white landowners who sought to grow fruit and vegetables in California. By 1902, California’s 139,000 Japanese residents vastly outnumbered the roughly 70,000 Chinese residents. Like the Chinese, the Japanese immigrants were often greeted by racist epithets, such as “Jap,” and realtors often refused to sell them houses. The Japanese were attacked by white laborers and were denied citizenship and the vote. A sizable network of Japanese businesses developed; some (such as restaurants and boarding houses) catered to Japanese clients. When the use of refrigerated railroad cars created large national markets for fruits and vegetables, the Japanese quickly became major producers of these products; they ingeniously adapted Japanese irrigation techniques to American farms. By initially leasing or renting land, they obtained resources to purchase their own land. But the growing Japanese population soon encountered white racism. Angered by their competition, white laborers demanded that the Chinese Exclusion Act, due for renewal in 1902, include a ban on Japanese immigration. President Theodore Roosevelt, anxious for diplomatic reasons not to antagonize Japan, opposed this policy and at one point used federal troops to protect the Japanese from race riots in San Francisco. However, in the Gentleman’s Agreement of 1907, he persuaded Japan not to permit further emigration of laborers to the United States, except for family members of existing residents. (Once he had left office, Roosevelt favored exclusion of the Japanese.) Moreover, angered by the success of the Japanese in agriculture, California enacted legislation in 1913 to disallow Japanese immigrants from obtaining land and to restrict their leases to three years. On discovering that the Japanese were circumventing the law by registering their land in the names of their American-born children, the California legislature further tightened the legislation so as to disallow this practice and even leasing itself. (Similar legislation was enacted in 12 other states.) The Japanese suffered another rebuff in 1922, when the Supreme Court ruled that Japanese Americans could not become citizens because 1790 federal legislation specified that citizens must be Caucasians. To make matters worse, legislation enacted by Congress in 1924 restricted the number of foreign-born persons admitted each year to 2% of the number of that nationality residing in the United States in 1890—a measure clearly directed at the Japanese population, which had numbered only 2,039 persons in 1890. (The Chinese were still banned from any immigration. * ) Understand the Appraisal of Frontier Policy Many persons benefited from the expansion of the frontier. Imagine the euphoria of the descendant of a serf who managed to survive the westward trek and the first penniless years on a small tract in the American Midwest. Despite abuses of the auction system of land disposal, a large class of yeoman farmers developed; they participated vigorously in local politics and helped one another with practical tasks. Civic participation in territorial governments was promoted by a desire to achieve admission to the Union as a state, which conferred tangible benefits—in particular, protection from Native Americans and access to federal funds for internal improvements. A tradition of sectarian and private philanthropy developed in some frontier communities. But speculation, greed, and violence were as much the legacy of the frontier as mutual aid (see Insert 4.8 ). Americans came to the frontier as individualists and as persons who believed in limited government; accordingly, they fashioned local institutions that emphasized the protection of property rights rather than the development of programs and institutions that would help individuals who were disabled, sick, or poor or who were Native Americans displaced by the white settlers. Insert 4.8. Critical Analysis: The Historical Roots of American V iolence In the early part of the 21st century, the United States has far higher homicide rates than other industrialized nations. Does the American historical experience cast any light on this phenomenon? In thinking about this issue, consider the American attachment to personal ownership of weapons, relatively unrestricted by government policy, and ask whether this attachment stems from the widespread ownership LO 4-10 of weapons on the American frontier. Or did other cultural factors and economic factors lead Americans to purchase and use guns even in the 19th century, including a male-dominated society and culture as well as advertising by the gun-producing industry? Why did Americans retain their widespread ownership and use of guns even when the nation urbanized in the late 19th and 20th centuries— and when relatively few Americans used their guns for hunting? Would restriction of gun ownership dramatically reduce homicides in contemporary America? Why does Canada possess far lower rates of homicides committed with firearms even though more Canadians possess them? Why has considerable public sentiment for stronger controls over gun ownership been ineffective in producing legislative action by state and federal legislatures, governors, and presidents? Would research help us analyze these questions and consider policies that would decrease violence in the United States? As with farm foreclosures of the 1920s and 1980s, the society demonstrated little compassion for persons who were bankrupted by economic forces beyond their control. Assessed in terms of the sheer speed at which the population was dispersed through the countryside and the rate at which the land was cleared and cultivated or ranched, the American frontier was an unqualified success. Measured in terms of the development of social institutions to meet common human needs or the distribution of lands to needy persons, however, the American frontier was a failure, particularly when the crushed lives of the indigenous peoples are entered into the balance. The American frontier not only reflected American individualism but also perpetuated and intensified that individualism. As stories of settlement, conquest, and success reached Americans in other sections of the country, prevailing American individualism was reinforced: Frontier success seemed to confirm the idea that anyone could succeed by working hard and taking risks. If unlimited land is available, some Americans asked, why do Americans need to develop other social resources and programs to help the needy? * Arguably, the frontier both reflected and intensified American racism as well. Native Americans and Spanish-speaking residents who attacked white settlers as they moved across the land were portrayed as barbaric and uncivilized peoples. Asian Americans who helped construct railroads on the frontier were often vilified as subhuman. Some commentators viewed the frontier as a laboratory experiment that juxtaposed “advanced” with “lesser” peoples—an experiment that confirmed the racial and genetic superiority of Anglo-Saxons. The pangs of guilt felt by some white settlers were eased by their belief that their conquest would improve the general quality of the human race and the nation. The development of farms, plantations, and mines in newly developed territories, as well as the construction of roads and railroads to reach these areas, required large amounts of labor. As Southerners had done, entrepreneurs on the frontier used slaves to grow cotton and tobacco and employed Latinos and Asians on farms, in the mines, on the railroads, and in emerging industries. These laborers were often treated brutally by their employers—and they resided in jurisdictions that enacted harsh legislation to deprive them of their basic rights. Nor were federal authorities helpful; indeed, immigration legislation and various court rulings served to buttress and supplement the discrimination and racism rampant in local jurisdictions. Review the Civil War and the Oppression of Freed Slaves EP 3a As a percentage of the total population, more American lives were lost during the Civil War than during World War II. However, battlefield casualties reflect only one portion of the human toll. Millions of people were dislocated during and after the war, and freed slaves were cast into a society with few economic or social supports. Of course, slaves were freed, which was an enormous achievement. LO 4-11 Origins of the Civil W ar Was the war fought to help the slaves or for other objectives? Controversy exists among historians about the war’s precise causes, but research suggests that the war can be attributed to multiple factors, many of which had little to do with improving the condition of freed slaves. * By 1830, the American nation included three societies that were profoundly different from one another. With poor soil and long winters, New England had relatively marginal agriculture, and many of its citizens had begun to envision their region as a center for commerce and industry. Its leading citizens demanded high tariffs to protect fledgling industries from foreign competitors and demanded federal subsidies for its small shipping industry. The expanding Northern frontier, which extended into Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri, became the breadbasket of the nation; its crops were increasingly transported to New England in exchange for commodities. This area sought federal funds to develop roads, canals, and railroads that were vital to trade with New England. New England and the frontier communities gradually became closely linked because each depended on the other for goods. During years when crop yields were poor on the frontier, New England had to import food, and so there were fewer resources to build industry; likewise, a recession in New England meant that prices for agricultural produce from the frontier plummeted. The economy of the South, which included the Old South (states such as Virginia, the Carolinas, Alabama, and Georgia) and a Southern frontier (territories in states that are now Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas), depended on tobacco and cotton, which were often cultivated by slaves. Like the agricultural produce of the Northern frontier, cotton and tobacco became part of the world economy thanks to New England shippers, who bought and exported Southern cotton to finance the expansion of New England industry. The conditions of the slaves varied, but many historians believe that the American version of slavery was even more repressive than slavery in South America and the West Indies. Reduced to chattel and lacking support from church, government, and legal institutions, slaves were wholly at the mercy of their masters. Even this cursory discussion points to sectional rivalries that precipitated the Civil War. Most Northern families, who usually knew someone who had gone to the frontier to obtain land, wanted to preserve the frontier for white settlers. But the frontier also appealed to Southerners, who wanted new lands for cotton plantations. Slavery could not easily coexist with a paid labor force, as it required supportive laws, local police, courts, and public opinion to keep the slaves in their bondage and to ensure the return of runaways. Northern settlers were not likely to cooperate in the maintenance of slavery because they came from areas dominated by small farmers and paid workers, who feared the preemption of land by plantations. While abolitionists in the North were widely reviled in the 1830s because of deep- seated racism, by the 1850s growing numbers of Northerners came to view the institution of slavery as morally flawed. * This rivalry for land was exacerbated by political realities. A delicate balance existed in the Congress among New England, the Northern frontier, and the South. New England wanted high tariffs and subsidies for ships; the frontier areas wanted public money for internal improvements and cheap land; and the South wanted low tariffs and, at least until the 1830s, some internal improvements. In the decades following the 1830s, however, Southern views and institutions became markedly different from those of the North. Its leaders rallied behind an extreme view of limited government. They wanted virtually no taxes, no internal improvements, and low tariffs. Although the North already emphasized railroads and public education by the 1840s, the South remained a relatively backward agricultural area dominated by cotton and tobacco. Although many Southern leaders prior to the 1830s had not defended slavery but rather contended that its swift elimination would be impractical, they idealized it in succeeding decades as a means of avoiding the chasm between social classes that existed under “wage slavery” in New England’s emerging industrial system. As the cultural and policy views of the North and South diverged, each side came to view with alarm the possibility that the other might dominate the Congress by obtaining new representatives from frontier states. Both Northerners and Southerners realized that the region that controlled Congress could also write legislation to outlaw or condone slavery in the frontier areas. * Because Northerners and Southerners had known since the early 19th century that cohabitation of specific territories was difficult, they had avoided armed conflict by partitioning the frontier into slave-holding and free territories. A series of ingenious compromises from 1787 to 1850 gave sections of the frontier to each side, as illustrated by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the Compromise of 1850. When the Territory of Missouri applied for statehood in 1818, free states and slave states each had 22 senators in the U.S. Senate. To retain this balance, the Missouri Compromise proposed to admit Maine as a free state and Missouri as a slave state—and to avert future discord by prohibiting slavery to the north of a line extending westward from Missouri’s southern boundary through the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase. This outcome seemed to be a draw between slave and free states. However, the Compromise ignored the fact that settlers from both the North and South would soon stream into frontier lands, with the hope of eventually claiming them for the North or the South regardless of the Compromise of 1820. By 1850, an atmosphere of mutual paranoia had developed. Once again, there was a balance between slave and free states (15 of each) in 1848, but the American conquest of Mexico made available a huge territory that would eventually give rise to many new states. Utah and then California sought admission as free states, while Texas, already admitted as a slave state in 1845, claimed half of New Mexico. The Compromise of 1850, which was achieved with considerable difficulty in this tense atmosphere, sought to give both North and South concessions. California was admitted as a free state, whereas the remainder of the formerly Mexican land was divided into the territories of Utah and New Mexico, which had no federal restrictions on slavery. But the Compromise contained a fatal flaw: It did not specifically address the needs of two new territories that were rapidly filling with settlers from both the North and South—namely, Kansas and Nebraska. Under the terms of the Missouri Compromise of 1820, these territories should have been free, but increasing numbers of Northerners and Southerners were not in a mood to compromise. Many Southerners were convinced that the Congress did not have the right to declare that they could not bring slaves into any territory or state; many Northerners believed slavery should be outlawed from the start in all territories. In this embattled atmosphere, the Congress decided to allow each territory to choose for itself whether to be free or slaveholding. When Congress relinquished its role of partitioning the frontier, the battle between the North and South moved to the territories, where determined settlers from each region confronted one another. As battles were waged, dramatic stories of the other side’s brutality spread through the North and South. In the 1850s, settlers from both the North and South poured into the Kansas and Nebraska territories. Rival territorial conventions and legislatures convened by slaveholding and Northern settlers declared opposite policies in the territories. Armed conflict between Southerners and Northerners became commonplace, as individuals took the law into their own hands. Another provision of the Compromise of 1850 further embittered the atmosphere. To appease Southerners, the Compromise included a stronger fugitive slave law, which denied fugitives the right to trial by jury and permitted their return to slavery merely on the testimony of a claimant. Southern slave catchers hunted down fugitives who escaped to the North— even those who had lived there in freedom for 30 years or more. Previously, many Northerners had seen slavery as a distant institution, but this law made them realize the extent to which they had cooperated with the South in preserving slavery—and helped abolitionists dramatize its inhumanity. Regional polarization was soon reflected in a realignment of the nation’s political parties. Two major political parties existed in 1850: the Whigs and the Democrats competed relatively evenly in the South and the states that now compose the Midwest. With the rapid emergence of the Republican Party after the presidential election of 1856, the Republican Party (to which Abraham Lincoln tied his fortunes) supplanted the Whig Party and quickly became the party of the North; its leaders demanded that slavery be outlawed from the outset in all territories. Leaders of the Democratic Party, which became the party of the South, argued that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to outlaw slavery in the territories or anywhere else. Many Southerners believed that they had no recourse but to secede from the Union when Lincoln was elected president in 1860. They were convinced that he would close the territories to slavery and, with Congress controlled by Northerners, eventually try to amend the Constitution so as to end slavery. The South fired the first shot by attacking a federal fort in South Carolina in 1861, but the seeds of the Civil War were sown in the conflict over the rich lands of the Western frontier. If many Northerners fought the war primarily to secure land and political power for their region, a second cause of the war was nationalism. South Carolinians had threatened to secede from the Union in 1832, but Andrew Jackson, who believed the Union should be preserved at all costs, intimidated them. Southerners’ contemplation of secession in the 1850s exposed them to Northerners’ nationalistic wrath. But nationalism did not foster humanitarian proposals to help slaves; indeed, nationalism was often linked to racism, as Americans envisioned the dominion of the Anglo-Saxon race from coast to coast. The Northern desire to abolish slavery may be cited as a third cause of the war. If any group were to fight the war with the interests of slaves at heart, it should have been the abolitionists, who courageously endured the wrath of Northern white audiences when they promoted their cause in the decades preceding the war. However, even the abolitionists had limited notions of the social reforms that freed slaves would need in the wake of emancipation. Most abolitionists were imbued with the prevailing racism of their era. On the one hand, they were attracted by the gentleness commonly ascribed to African Americans in the 19th century and argued that the laziness attributed to African Americans was not an intrinsic characteristic but rather was due to environmental factors. On the other hand, many abolitionists were also convinced that African Americans had a savage side to their nature, could not be trusted, and were consumed by sexual urges. Some abolitionists even believed that African Americans should not be allowed to intermarry with whites and that they should not be given the right to vote. * Another limitation of abolitionists was that, like their contemporaries, they applied a moral ideology to the social problems of poverty, alcoholism, and crime. Many abolitionists believed that slaves were morally flawed because the plantation environment had encouraged them to be shiftless and promiscuous. To rehabilitate slaves, they urged utilization of the same set of educational and poorhouse institutions that Northern reformers sought for immigrants living in poverty. Their ideology blinded them to the need to distribute land to freed slaves, to provide them with resources with which to purchase their own land, or to help them migrate to Northern cities, where the emerging industrial order offered vast economic opportunities. Furthermore, many abolitionists pointed to the relative poverty of African Americans in the North, where they were concentrated in urban areas such as New York City and Philadelphia, as evidence that African Americans needed a supervised moral regimen after they had obtained their freedom. Some abolitionists even ascribed the widespread discrimination by Northerners against African Americans—who were denied the vote in most Northern states, placed in segregated public schools, and denied access to public transportation and public accommodations—to the poor reputation that African Americans had brought on themselves by not sufficiently improving their economic status. * Even those who supported the Civil War out of a genuine desire to help the slaves, then, rarely envisioned the need for reforms such as massive distribution of land or resources to them. The primary motivations for the war were sectional rivalries, nationalism, and the Northerners’ moralistic ideology rather than a desire to help freed slaves by enacting sweeping economic and social reforms. It is ironic that the moral treatment ideology, which was a simplistic approach to the social needs of poor whites, was applied to the African American population, whose problems were so obviously linked to the oppression they had experienced in both the South and the North. Once emancipated, Southern slaves were ill prepared to participate in the capitalist economy. They had been systematically denied education by white owners, who feared it might make them rebellious. Some slaves were allowed to attend white Protestant churches but had to sit in segregated galleries. We should not portray slaves as docile victims, however. Slaves developed complex tactics for coping with their oppression. Couples married and had tightly knit families even within the confines of a plantation. While owners could sell their slaves at any time, many encouraged stable families to encourage their slaves to produce more babies. Slaves often embraced evangelical Protestantism, which they infused with their own rhythmic singing and turned to their own purposes. As Sellers notes, “A gospel subversive of slavery resonated through spirituals and resentment of oppressors through secular songs and tales” (see Insert 4.9 ). They learned to present themselves to whites as compliant and docile while maintaining “day-to-day resistance of malingering, stealing, tool breaking, and arson.” Many ran away, whether singly or in small groups, despite the obvious danger to themselves; a few, like Nat Turner in 1831, even took the suicidal course of open rebellion. * Insert 4.9. Apply Knowledge of Human Behavior and the Social Environment Members of vulnerable populations often develop empowerment strategies to cope with their seeming lack of power and victimization of them—even persons as marginalized as slaves. What theories of human behavior might help us understand this resilience? Take any other vulnerable population and identify one or more empowerment strategies that they use to cope with their lack of power. Explore Social Policy during the W ar The primary issue to be resolved during the war was the legal status of slaves. In its infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Supreme Court had declared that slaves—and free descendants of slaves—were not persons and thus not entitled to constitutional protections or citizenship, even when they lived in free territories. Known as the Great Emancipator, Lincoln was hardly a militant opponent of slavery; he often infuriated abolitionists, who wanted him to seek an immediate end to slavery. Prior to the war, he had not proposed to terminate slavery; instead, he wanted only to restrict it to existing slave states. Nor did he immediately declare the slaves to be free once the war began, because he hoped Southern states would negotiate an early end to the war if they were allowed to retain slaves in existing states. When he finally issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, he declared only those slaves to be free who were in areas still in rebellion against the Union, in an obvious effort to get border states, such as Kentucky, to cease hostilities. * Despite their limitations, abolitionists kept incessant pressure on Lincoln to free the slaves. Frederick Douglass was one of the most notable of them (see Insert 4.10 ). Insert 4.10. Proﬁles in Policy Practice and Advocacy: Frederick Douglass (1817–1895) Frederick Douglass—orator and abolitionist—is widely acknowledged as the most significant African American leader of the 19th century. Douglass, whose real name was Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, was born a slave in Tuckahoe, Maryland, sometime in 1817. His mother, Harriet Bailey, was a slave; his father was an unknown white man, perhaps his owner. At a young age, Douglass was taken LO 4-12 away from his mother and forced to live on a plantation some 12 miles away. His childhood was anything but stable; he never enjoyed the security of a family life. In his autobiography Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (1845), Douglass wrote, “My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant—before I knew her as a mother…. I never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or five times in my life; and each of these times was very short in duration, and at night.” Though many later criticized him for losing sight of the cause for freedom and equality, most of Douglass’s life was dedicated to the crusade to end slavery and the promotion of civil and human rights for all Americans. Douglass quickly recognized that to be an effective leader in the abolitionist movement, he was going to have to be educated. Douglass’s education began when he was eight years old and sent by his owner to Baltimore to work as a house servant. There, his mistress, over the objections of her husband, taught Douglass the fundamentals of reading. When his mistress’s lessons ceased, Douglass continued his education by learning what he could from white children who shared their reading and writing skills with him. He soon concluded that it was through depriving slaves of an education that the white man was able to maintain control over them. Once he was able to read and write, Douglass began teaching other slaves, despite the risk of severe consequences. By the time he was 16 years old, Douglass was once again working on the plantation as a field hand, but his desire to be free was much greater than before. In 1833, he was jailed for attempting, unsuccessfully, to escape from slavery. He was released to his owner, who in turn sent him back to Baltimore to begin training as a ship repairman. In 1838, Douglass tried to escape to freedom again. This time, he succeeded in escaping to New York by using a black sailor’s affidavit, which certified that the bearer was a free person. Once in New York, Douglass sent for his soon-to-be wife, Anna Murray. Shortly thereafter, the couple married and moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where Douglass sought work at the shipyards. The year 1841 was a major turning point in the life of Douglass. A speech he gave on abolition, in Nantucket, Maryland, earned him the recognition of abolitionist leader William Lloyd Garrison. So impressed with Douglass’s presentation was Garrison that he hired him to be a full-time lecturer for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. Within two years, Douglass was debating against some of the sharpest minds in America, including Henry Highland Garnet. At a Negro Convention Movement gathering in Buffalo, New York, Garnet, also a former slave, called on slaves to rise up against the American slave system. Douglass countered Garnet’s proposal, arguing that if slaves were to rise up they would surely be crushed. The audience supported Douglass’s call for a peaceful approach to ending slavery. Douglass’s skills as an orator were so impeccable that audiences sometimes questioned whether he could have been a slave. In 1845, he responded to their skepticism by writing Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. Because this book contained much factual information, including the fact that he was a runaway slave, Douglass ran the risk of being recaptured by his former owner. To avoid this possibility, Douglass launched a two-year speechmaking tour of the British Isles from 1845 to 1847. When he left the United States, he was Garrison’s protege; when he returned, he was an emergent African American leader in the abolitionist movement. In 1847, Douglass returned to the United States a free man. British friends and admirers had purchased his freedom for $750. They also gave him a $2,000 “testimonial,” which he used to establish the North Star as a weekly journal in Rochester, New York. Together with Garrison’s Liberator , the North Star became a leading publication of the abolitionist movement. Aside from abolition issues, Douglass’s journal included articles promoting vocational education for African Americans and calls for those in the African American community to live righteously. Douglass also became involved in supporting reform movements outside his own. In 1848, at the first major assemblage of women’s rights advocates at Seneca Falls, New York, Douglass was the only man to take a firm position in support of the right of women to the franchise. He also supported the temperance movement, opposing the consumption of alcohol, which he believed was linked to crime and poverty. In 1852, Douglass spoke on the issue of alcohol consumption at a meeting of the New York State Temperance Convention in Rochester. Douglass viewed the onset of the Civil War as the beginning of the crusade for freedom. After the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, he helped recruit African American troops for the Union Army, enrolling two of his sons. Although he was proud that African Americans were fighting against the secessionists, he was concerned that they were discriminated against in pay, promotions, and treatment when captured. When he took his concerns to Abraham Lincoln, he was told that the American public was not prepared to support equality of treatment for African American troops. Douglass found solace in knowing that the 200,000 armed African Americans were a major factor in the Union Army’s eventual victory. Throughout the Reconstruction period, Douglass continued to fight for African American equality and urged that the newly freed Americans be given civil rights and the vote. In the 1870s, he took the job of editor of the New National Era, a weekly paper aimed at providing moral support to freedmen. Douglass, a loyal supporter of the Republican Party, was rewarded by President Rutherford B. Hayes with an appointment as marshal of the District of Columbia in 1877. This marked the first time in the history of the United States that an African American held public office other than in the post-Civil War South. Douglass considered the appointment a victory for the African American community. Another first for African Americans came in 1881, when President James A. Garfield appointed Douglass recorder of deeds for the District of Columbia. During his tenure in public service, Douglass continued to speak out against segregation, disenfranchisement, and the lynching of African Americans. Ever optimistic, he continued to believe that African Americans would one day witness equality in the United States. In 1884, two years after the death of his first wife, Douglass married Helen Pitts, a white woman who had worked in the recorder’s office as his secretary. Douglass came under intense criticism from the white and African American communities. Douglass responded, saying his first wife “was the color of my mother, and the second, the color of my father.” In 1889, Douglass was appointed minister-resident and consul general to the Republic of Haiti. On February 20, 1895, Frederick Douglass, then about 78 years old, died at his home in Washington, DC. Earlier that day, Douglass had attended a convention of woman suffragists. In the turmoil of the Civil War, the social welfare issues of dislocated persons received only secondary attention and were addressed extemporaneously. The Union (Northern) Army was the major instrument of social welfare, by virtue of its presence in the South. Vast numbers of African Americans had to be supported as they left plantations, either because the Union Army had conquered Southern territory or because slaves fled behind Union lines. The Union Army constructed and maintained many camps where former slaves were placed in barracks or tents and given food and health care. These camps provided harsh surroundings; roughly 25% of their occupants died of disease. Remember, though, that mortality rates were similar for Union troops because of the lack of modern medical technology to stem epidemics and infection. Some of the military administrators of the camps, like most citizens of the era, believed that the freed slaves were intrinsically lazy, and so they placed many of them on work details on camp fortifications or had them work under contract labor on plantations in conquered territories. Many Northern philanthropic societies sent legions of volunteers to assist refugees behind Union lines. Some were nonsectarian, whereas others drew assistance from churches. They provided clothing, food, and medical supplies and developed some schools. Various government departments developed programs in the South, though often in isolation from one another. The War Department operated the camps for the freed slaves, and the Treasury Department controlled lands that had been confiscated from Confederate landowners. The first systematic inquiry into the condition of freed slaves, which was conducted in 1862 when President Lincoln appointed the American Freedmen’s Inquiry Commission, recommended the establishment of a federal agency to coordinate the work of federal and private agencies and to develop new programs to meet the needs of freed slaves, which could not be sufficiently addressed by private philanthropy. After extended debate in the Congress, the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Land was established. Though the bureau was informally known as the Freedmen’s Bureau, its official name emphasized refugees because many legislators did not want to show favoritism to African Americans. President Johnson opposed the bureau on the grounds that it would do more for African Americans than had been done for whites. A debate about the proper location of the agency in the federal bureaucracy nearly stalemated the legislation; abolitionists wanted it to be placed in the Treasury Department —which controlled lands that had been abandoned by , or confiscated from, Confederate supporters—to facilitate transfer of formerly Confederate lands to freed slaves; but legislators placed the agency in the War Department. * The Freedmen’s Bureau was established in 1865 in a manner that virtually ensured that it would be unable to develop sweeping economic and social programs to help the freedmen. Its position in the War Department reflected its status as a wartime, rather than permanent, agency; indeed, it was terminated in 1872. Virtually no funding was given to the new agency; it was assumed that private philanthropy, largely from the North, could address most of the needs of freed slaves. Southerners—and some Northerners—staunchly opposed the legislation on the grounds that it represented unconstitutional delving by federal authorities into welfare matters, which were perceived by many persons to belong to the jurisdiction of state and local governments. The Freedmen’s Bureau was given authority to establish courts in the South to help African Americans obtain their freedom, to make certain that terms of contract labor between freed slaves and landowners were clearly written and honored, and to distribute confiscated and abandoned land, but it lacked even a fulltime director of legal affairs. Because it was located in the War Department, many army officials were appointed to its staff; some of them were sensitive to the economic and social needs of freed African Americans, but others favored punitive or racist remedies. * Other policy setbacks during the Civil War had ominous implications for the freed slaves. In an agricultural society, freed slaves desperately needed land; without it, they had to work as tenant farmers or sharecroppers. Legislation that established the Freedmen’s Bureau promised 40 acres of abandoned or confiscated land to every male refugee, but it could not be implemented unless government authorities identified abandoned land, took possession of it, and distributed it to the penniless former slaves. However, confiscation of land ran counter to American veneration of property owners’ rights and the belief that government had no right to interfere with it; even many abolitionists did not support land confiscation during the war. Furthermore, Southern landowners were able to use elaborate legal strategies to prevent the confiscation of their property; one effective tactic was to use local or even federal courts to oppose the rulings of courts operated by the Freedmen’s Bureau. Relatively few African Americans were resettled on farms; the Freedmen’s Bureau was able to resettle roughly 40,000 freed slaves—out of a total of more than 3 million—on abandoned or confiscated land. The most successful efforts to redistribute land were undertaken by Generals Sherman and Grant, who unilaterally gave land to African Americans in conquered territories in Georgia and Alabama. These policies were foiled after the war, however, when President Andrew Johnson declared that African Americans occupied the lands illegally and required them to surrender their lands to the prior owners. * Go to this book’s MindTap to learn about the period following the Civil War from 1866 to 1900, often called “Reconstruction.” This section discusses the hardships experienced by freed slaves. Most became “sharecroppers” who worked for former plantation owners at minimal pay or by renting their land as “sharecroppers.” While the white plantation class lost much of its power in the immediate wake of the war as federal troops policed the South, it regained much of its former power when the Congress decided to withdraw the federal troops. A series of punitive laws were enacted in the South, called “Jim Crow laws,” that disallowed their use of public facilities, took away their voting privileges, and imposed strict laws upon them. Some African Americans were able to establish businesses in Southern cities but the vast majority remained in rural areas. Analyze the Plight of Freed Slaves The civil and economic rights of freed slaves in the wake of the Civil War depended on the continuing presence of Northern troops in the South, where many of them were stationed as an occupying force. A symbolic event in 1877 illustrated the decline of Northern pressure on the South. In the 1876 presidential contest between Democrat Samuel Tilden and Republican Rutherford Hayes, the vote had been so close that the Electoral College was stalemated. To break the stalemate, the Democrats finally agreed to support Hayes, but only if he agreed to withdraw troops from the South. That fateful deal dimmed the hopes of African Americans in the South, who were left to the mercy of Southern whites. The Republican Party, which had spearheaded federal civil rights legislation after the war, had viewed the Southern question as negotiable in the push and pull of the political process. Reformers lost an opportunity to improve the lot of freed slaves after the Civil War. The major instrument of reform, the Freedmen’s Bureau, was distressingly underfunded and had limited social welfare functions. More than 30% of its scant resources were devoted to educational programs for African Americans, but education could hardly suffice if African Americans had no land, resources, homes, or civil and political rights. The education given by the Freedmen’s Bureau focused on moral rules because it was widely assumed that African Americans, like low-income persons in the North, could succeed in life only if they were instructed in the tenets of honesty, religion, and thrift. Although initially enacted to last only one year after the end of the war, the Freedmen’s Bureau did manage to survive until 1872. * Approximately one-fifth of African American families owned land in 1870, but most of them were tenant farmers who became mired in debt as they borrowed money from white Southerners for seeds, fertilizer, machines, and food. Many African American landowners were forced into foreclosure by their inability to repay debts or to secure loans from white-controlled banks. African Americans who relocated to Southern cities were subject to unrelenting discrimination in job markets and to segregated housing and schools. * There seemed room for optimism even as late as 1877, however. African Americans still voted in most Southern jurisdictions; around 10% of school- age African Americans attended schools that had been established by the Freedmen’s Bureau; and a small group of African American landowners and small businessmen existed. A continuing erosion of civil rights offset these gains. The Supreme Court interpreted civil rights legislation and the 14th Amendment so restrictively that they afforded few protections for African Americans. The requirement that persons could not be deprived of their civil liberties without due process was ruled by the Supreme Court to apply only to discrimination against African Americans by individuals; states’ discriminatory laws (such as those requiring poll taxes or literacy tests for voters) were thus legitimized. In the late 19th century, a new generation of political leaders who hardly remembered the Civil War came to power in the North and South. They increasingly assumed that African Americans should not participate in political, social, or economic affairs. Southern states enacted a new wave of laws, so-called Jim Crow legislation, that deprived African Americans of their basic civil rights. These laws were not rescinded until nearly a century after the Civil War. * It is instructive to compare the advantages enjoyed by European immigrants with the condition of freed slaves. White immigrants were given access to cheap land on the frontier—often 160 acres per person. Other white immigrants—or their children—developed small businesses in rural areas or in cities. Often literate even before they came to the United States, white immigrants sent their children to public schools in the North. As factories developed, immigrants obtained jobs in them, albeit at low wages. Enjoying free movement, immigrants and their descendants traveled between cities and regions to better their condition. They formed churches and associations to promote the interests of their groups; powerful political machines in major cities distributed jobs to the Irish, Italians, Germans, and others. By contrast, freed slaves were mostly mired in isolated rural areas where they could not emulate the white immigrants’ economic development. Lacking assets such as land and small businesses, they could not develop capital or borrow funds from banks. Mostly illiterate, they often lacked access to the public schools that could prepare them to compete in the capitalist order. Separated from the industrial centers that dominated the American economy by 1900, they could not find an economic niche in manufacturing that might bring a measure of security to them and their children. Trapped in a sharecropping system, African Americans could not save funds, and so they had no resources—much less land or businesses— to pass on to their children when they died. Dispersed in remote areas with poor communication, they could not easily organize associations akin to the self-help groups formed by the Irish and Italians. Once the repressive codes were in place and they had been denied suffrage, they could not develop political machines that would distribute jobs and resources to African Americans. Freed slaves, then, were subjected not just to personal discrimination but to a structural discrimination that made it likely that they would fall behind white immigrants in the North—not because African Americans lacked the work ethic or supportive families but because they were denied access to the assets, economic opportunities, and associations enjoyed by their Northern white counterparts. * Recognize the Betrayal of W omen during and after the Civil W ar Curiously, abolitionism and the Civil War were associated with policy issues affecting women. Many women entered the world of politics by participating in temperance, charity, and church movements in the antebellum period, though they often occupied decidedly subordinate positions, in separate women’s auxiliaries. The women in the abolitionist movement were more daring. Many of them defied the widespread custom that women could not engage in public speaking to mixed audiences, despite jeers from skeptical audiences, and were so bold as to sign public petitions, despite Congress’s consideration of legislation in 1834 to disallow petitions signed by women. Numerous women became leaders in the abolitionist crusade. These abolitionist leaders, often with support from male abolitionists, applied the logic of emancipation to themselves and began to question traditional marriage vows that required women to pledge obedience, as well as sexist language in the Bible and hymns, discriminatory property laws, and the condescension of males. They also sought liberalization of divorce laws and universal suffrage. These women found their hopes dashed in the wake of the Civil War, however. Having expended enormous energy to emancipate slaves, many of them hoped that women would receive the vote when it was given to freed slaves with passage of the 14th and 15th Amendments. But male legislators, many women, and the Republican Party were not willing to accept this major policy change. * The women’s movement focused on suffrage in the Gilded Age but divided into two factions. The American Women’s Suffrage Association circulated petitions that beseeched the state legislatures to change their constitutions so as to grant women the vote, whereas the National Women’s Suffrage LO 4-13 Association sought a range of reforms for women, including passage of a federal constitutional amendment to enact universal suffrage. Both groups were frustrated, despite some modest gains. Most states and the Congress resisted universal suffrage because of the sexism of the era as well as the determined lobbying of the liquor industry, which was certain that women would support prohibition. The two factions of the women’s movement united in 1890 into the National American Women’s Suffrage Association but had scant success in obtaining suffrage reforms during the remainder of the century, though some states liberalized property laws and women continued to increase their enrollments in secondary and college education. * However, by 1916, 12 states had granted suffrage to women due to incessant pressure from suffragettes on state legislatures. Recognize the Oppression of W orkers during the Early Stages of American Industrialization EP 1a EP 3a The speed of the American transition from an agricultural to an industrial society was unprecedented in world history; it is rivaled only by the pace of Japanese and Russian industrialization in the mid 20th century and Chinese industrialization in the latter part of the 20th century into the 21st century. No more than 20% of Americans lived in cities in 1860, and the nation ranked fourth in the world in the value of its manufactured products. In 1920, however, more than 50% of Americans lived in cities, and the nation ranked first in industrial output. Indeed, the total population of urban areas grew from 5 million in 1860 to 25 million in 1900. LO 4-14 Industrialization before the Civil War Industrialization began prior to the Civil War, when most nonagricultural workers were still employed in such skilled crafts as carpentry, blacksmithing, and shoemaking. Textile, food processing, and mining industries, as well as factory-based mass production of shoes, developed in New England in the 1830s and 1840s. Some textile plants were located in rural areas, where they employed middle-class women who boarded on the premises; others were located in urban areas, where they employed entire families. Even before the Civil War, factory owners used large numbers of children and women to minimize their labor costs, particularly in textile factories. Railroads were rapidly constructed in the North; indeed, by 1840, the United States had laid twice as much track as all of Europe. In the absence of regulations, workers were subjected to brutal working conditions; they commonly worked for more than 12 hours per day (some worked as many as 15 hours) at abysmally low rates of pay and in unsanitary, dark, and dangerous conditions. Skilled workers who had made entire products in shops or homes before industrialization were often reduced to laboring as unskilled tenders of machines. A turbulent economic environment, marked by frequent recessions and cut- throat competition between domestic and foreign enterprises, accompanied industrialization. England tried to sabotage the development of industry in America by imposing tariffs on American imports, by prohibiting the export of technology to America, and by dumping commodities on American markets at artificially low prices. American industrialists, in turn, were vulnerable to bankruptcy because they accumulated enormous debts to build factories and acquire machinery. * Already considerable in the colonial period, economic hardship in Eastern cities became even more serious as cities grew in size and recessions threw many into unemployment. To make matters worse, factory workers in the growing cities of New England had no fallback strategies. Distressed farmers could try to maintain a subsistence living through simple bartering or by producing their own food, but urban dwellers often did not own land. Moreover, farmers could survive hard times by selling a portion of their lands or working for other farmers; city dwellers had no such opportunity. Finally, farm families could pool their resources in times of need, but that was not an option for many city dwellers, who were separated from their families. Industrialization spawned other problems, too. Unskilled factory work was repetitious and exhausting; and, because early equipment was often dangerous, work-related injuries were common. * Why Industrialization T ook off and Rapidly Accelerated For a number of reasons, a truly dramatic acceleration of industrialization occurred during the Gilded Age, which extended from the Civil War to the end of the 19th century. Further expansion of the railroads opened up new markets and supplied agricultural produce and raw materials to the growing urban areas. Funds to build factories and purchase machinery were obtained from foreign sources, as well as from a rapidly expanding American banking system. Massive immigration provided a cheap and plentiful labor supply. From 1860 to 1890, nearly 10 million northern European immigrants came to American cities (including 3 million Germans, 2 million English, Scottish, and Welsh, and 1.5 million Irish) to join the 4 million who had immigrated in the 1840s and 1850s. A subsequent wave of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe dwarfed prior immigration; nearly 18 million people arrived between 1890 and 1920. Hungry for cheap labor, industrialists actively resisted any effort to stem this immigration. (We discuss immigrants more fully in Chapter 5 .) Americans obtained a competitive advantage over Europeans because their new plants were able to incorporate rapidly developing technology. Moreover, the American business environment—high tariffs, minimal safety regulations, and low taxes—was very favorable to entrepreneurs. Finally, between 1885 and 1900, the Supreme Court restricted the right of government to regulate corporations by ruling, for example, that manufacturing did not fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government because it was not “commerce” and that government could only gingerly regulate corporations because their rights were protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, which had originally been enacted to safeguard the rights of freed slaves. The courts applied the Sherman antitrust legislation to unions, which was enacted in 1890 to restrict corporate monopolies! Even the power of the federal government to collect income taxes was declared unconstitutional in a Supreme Court ruling in 1895. It is small wonder, then, that industrialization proceeded rapidly. * Along with industrialization came rapid population growth. Cities expanded at phenomenal rates. Frontier towns, such as Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Chicago, became major industrial centers, and with this growth came increasing social and economic problems. In some cities, packs of wild dogs roamed the streets and maimed or killed children. Typhoid, cholera, and malaria epidemics were common and sometimes decimated the populations of entire cities. Dangerous work conditions led to scores of injuries and deaths. Immigrants were particularly subject to wretched housing and industrial exploitation. The prewar pattern of periodic and devastating recessions continued unabated after the war. Major recessions caused unemployment rates that often exceeded 25% in major cities; indeed, 10% of the population of New York City was receiving welfare after the recession of 1873. Recessions sometimes lasted for many years; the devastating recession of 1873 (known as the long recession) lasted until 1878. Many people fell behind with their rent payments and were evicted. Unable to find work in the industrial order and lacking the security of family farms, large numbers of Americans became vagabonds and roamed the countryside. Indeed, 10% to 20% of Americans in the late 19th century lived in families where someone had “tramped.” As they fell on hard times, citizens frequently came into contact with orphanages, workhouses, and police departments. * Perhaps more than in any other period, American society was characterized by extreme economic inequality. Two classes predominated: the laboring and entrepreneurial classes. Because most people were poor, the middle class was small—no more than 16% of wage earners. Factory owners characteristically hired labor on a daily basis at factory gates and retained workers for only brief periods. In many plants, there was a complete turnover of labor each year. Americans of all social classes moved frequently, but transience was particularly marked among the working class, whose members had to remain mobile to find jobs in an uncertain economy. * In contemporary cities, relatively affluent suburbs encircle low-income urban areas. In the Gilded Age, by contrast, American cities were not segregated by social class. Because industry was located in the centers of cities, most people lived nearby for easy access to work. The large ethnic enclaves—Irish, Italian, Jewish, and others—were overwhelmingly poor but contained an array of small businesses, churches, and voluntary associations. Prior to the Civil War, industrialization had been marked by the development of small industries. In the latter part of the century, however, massive corporations were formed and systematically drove small competitors out of business. Not content to concentrate on making one product, many tycoons bought related companies. Andrew Carnegie coupled his steel empire with railroad and mining interests, and John D. Rockefeller extended his oil empire to include railroads and refineries. Massive cartels monopolized the production of certain products, charged exorbitant prices, and conspired to bankrupt competitors. The Victimization of Workers Reformers obtained some policy victories during the Gilded Age, including the establishment of limits on the working hours of federal employees, local housing regulations, some local regulations on the working conditions of women and children (see Figure 4.4 ), establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and passage of the Sherman antitrust legislation. However, the scope of these policies did not begin to match the magnitude of social needs. Many jurisdictions did not enact regulations on industry, housing, public health, or employers’ labor practices. Unemployment insurance, workmen’s compensation, or pensions for the elderly were hardly discussed. The Interstate Commerce Commission was not able to regulate railroads because it was not given formal powers or sufficient resources to accomplish its task. * The ineffectiveness of the Sherman Antitrust Act, enacted in 1890, was illustrated by the acceleration of the development of cartels after its passage. Figure 4.4. Details Welgos/Archive Photos/Getty Images Victimization of women and children in industrial plants in the 19th century. Intolerance of poor persons increased after the disastrous depression of 1873. As the frontier closed and cities swelled with poor immigrants, many Americans feared that this growing class of landless persons could disrupt existing institutions. They supported the repression of unions and strikes, as well as the suppression of “foreign radicals.” At the same time, there was a surge in punitive policies toward Native Americans and freed slaves, whom many Americans believed to be unreceptive to educational and moral uplift projects. * The nation seemed to be returning to the mercantile policies of the colonial period except that they now benefited corporations. Land subsidies to railroads, high tariffs to discourage imports, subsidies to shipping industries and telegraph lines, and public funding of improvements to rivers and harbors were motivated by a desire to build American economy. Colonial mercantilism had been a top-down policy, in which top officials and royalty engineered tariffs and subsidies to help the national economy and unemployed citizens. Political pressures from corporations, which made flagrant use of bribes and lobbying to advance their economic interests, prompted the bottom-up mercantilism of the Gilded Age. Although no nation had yet developed advanced policies to assist industrial workers, to upgrade cities, and to help persons who experienced unemployment, European societies were beginning to fashion social policies to mitigate the social and economic hardships that accompanied industrialization. The English Parliament, for example, enacted factory regulations in 1833, 1844, 1847, 1853, 1867, 1874, and 1878, as well as many public health measures. Germany enacted old-age pensions and unemployment insurance in the 1880s. The United States, which had pioneered suffrage, land distribution, and public education, lagged behind other nations in enacting social reforms. * Most historians have emphasized that the federal government adopted virtually no ameliorative policies during the Gilded Age, when the reluctance of the American response to social needs was particularly evident. Sociologist Theda Skocpol has recently argued that the federal government authorized generous social spending for veterans’ pensions after the Civil War. She notes that “this was not merely a military program” and that the government continued to make substantial outlays on pensions —one-fourth (or more) of its expenditures—until well into the 20th century. Eventually, she contends, the pensions became virtually an old-age pensions program; by 1910, 28% of all men aged 65 and over received federal benefits averaging $189 per year. * Skocpol is wrong, however, when she argues that these pensions constituted major involvement in social policy by the federal government. Although the pensions may have absorbed one-fourth or more of the federal budget, the federal budget itself was so meager that the nation devoted only 5.5% of its gross national product (GNP) to public spending (at all levels of government) in 1920, compared with 25.5% for France and 19.1% for Great Britain. * (Although some Civil War veterans had died by 1920, their numbers were augmented by large numbers of veterans of World War I.) One-fourth of such a small federal budget is not very much spending. Nor did the pensions breach the constitutional delegation of social programs to local governments because the benefits were linked to a national war, which clearly belonged within the purview of the federal government. It was not until the New Deal of the 1930s that the federal government took a major role in social policy—and increased its social spending sufficiently to signal a sharp departure from its limited role in the previous 150 years. Corporations and financiers took advantage of a power and policy vacuum after the Civil War. When the nation began to industrialize rapidly, agricultural interests were placed on the defensive and were fragmented. Unions would have been a logical countervailing force to business, but they were extraordinarily weak and focused on crafts and skilled trades rather than on unskilled workers in factories. Unions were organized by geographic locality and sought a basic wage for all skilled workers in that area. Their modest organizing successes in various cities in the 1830s were shattered by the recession of 1833, which allowed employers to violate agreements, to fire union members, and to hire nonunion members. There were a number of strikes and riots by factory workers in specific locations, but few unions larger than specific work sites developed. American courts, which began a pattern of rulings that severely limited the ability of unions to organize, often declared unions to represent unlawful conspiracies or to violate the rights of workers by coercing them to enlist. Many American economists believed as well that the “unnatural” wage increases obtained by unions decreased economic growth by absorbing funds from the pool of investment capital. * Economists’ theories hardly deterred workers from striking: Between 1881 and 1905, 7 million workers participated in 37,000 strikes. Some Americans began to fear that the nation was headed toward class war. After the Civil War, unions of unskilled workers were ruthlessly suppressed. Armed guards beat up strikers or intimidated union organizers. Owners of some Colorado mines forcibly placed strike leaders on a train to Arizona and told them not to come back. Industrialists found powerful allies in government and courts. Local politicians frequently used police and local militia to break strikes, and they were soon joined by federal officials, who used the National Guard and federal troops. In 1877, President Hayes mobilized federal troops to break a national strike against the railroads in which nearly 100 people died as rioters torched railroad facilities. Other sensational strikes punctuated the 1880s and 1890s. In the 1886 Hay-market Square riot in Chicago, for example, policemen and strikers were killed. In the Pullman Strike of 1894, federal troops quelled a strike against the railroads, but only after 700 freight cars were burned and 13 people died. Recessions and immigration frustrated the work of union organizers by breaking their momentum. Waves of immigrants provided industrialists with an inexhaustible source of cheap labor, which they used to break strikes and to depress wages. The weakness of unions in the late 19th century is illustrated by the strange saga of the Knights of Labor, a national organization that organized district assemblies of skilled and unskilled workers from many trades. The Knights engaged in secret rituals, often opposed unions and strikes on the grounds that brotherhood would solve industrial problems, and supported the development of self-employment and cooperative schemes. Although the Knights often supported progressive social legislation, their ideology precluded the development of effective pressure on industrialists. * Corporate interests became major contributors to the Democratic and Republican parties at local and national levels and used campaign contributions to obtain antiunion legislation, defeat adverse regulations, obtain tax concessions, and get government contracts. The weakness of government institutions and the lack of competing groups, such as unions and agriculture, allowed corporate and banking interests to dominate the political field and to secure favorable policies. Then, as now, American conservatives engaged in hypocritical behavior, simultaneously lambasting the role of government while getting huge concessions from it to advance the interests of affluent Americans and corporations (see Insert 4.11 ). Insert 4.1 1. Critical Analysis: The Conservatives’ Contradiction We have noted how, with the victory of Jefferson in 1800, a limited vision of American government triumphed over Hamilton’s perspective that government should actively intervene in the economic order to promote trade and economic growth. By the Gilded Age, industrialists publicly favored limited government. Yet they often used the power of government to advance their own economic interests—by supporting some policies (such as tariff and tax policies) and opposing others (such as regulations to require safe working conditions to support union organizing, or to help unemployed workers). This contrast between word and deed has been called the conservatives’ contradiction. Discuss the causes of this contradiction. In light of industrialists’ success in getting assistance from government, was the government truly limited in the Gilded Age? Provide examples of conservatives’ use of government to advance their economic and political interests in the United States today during the administration of President Donald Trump. Social reform was also impeded by changes in popular culture. Prior to the Civil War, many Americans had believed that the primary purpose in life was to lead a virtuous existence, which might lead to social mobility; most persons, it was widely believed, were destined to remain in relatively humble positions. Americans continued to emphasize moral virtues after the Civil War, but they placed far more emphasis on social mobility. Although pauperism had always been reviled, many Americans came to believe after the Civil War that poverty was itself an indication of personal failing. Increasingly, affluent persons were honored as models of success who inspired Americans of humbler origins to redouble their efforts. The Calvinist ambivalence about wealth, which was both revered as a sign from God of His pleasure and feared as a corrupter of moral virtue, was increasingly transformed into unambiguous worship of wealth. * This shift in culture was reflected in the stature of Herbert Spencer, an English writer who popularized and applied to society the theories of the English naturalist Charles Darwin. Darwin had fashioned a theory of the evolution of animal and plant forms to explain how different species emerged. He maintained that genetic mutations can provide some individuals within a species with a competitive edge, which allows them to survive—and breed—more effectively than other members of the species. As these new characteristics are perpetuated from generation to generation through natural selection, adaptive mutations thus lead to modification of the species. Spencer theorized that genes also influence how persons fare in society. He argued that persons who excel in business or other endeavors, much like animals or plants that survive in nature, possess superior genetic characteristics. His logic led him to conservative political conclusions: If affluent classes possess superior genes, he asked, should not society allow their numbers to increase, while adopting policies to bring reductions in the numbers of low-income persons? By propping up ne’er-do-wells, in Spencer’s view, governments and social agencies were artificially and wrongly interfering with natural selection within the social order. * Spencer’s use of Darwinian theory represented a sloppy and misguided application of biological theories to society. Poverty and other social ills are caused by innumerable factors, including environmental and societal conditions, as is illustrated by the plight of people of color in the United States in the 19th century. No evidence has been found by contemporary scientists to suggest that groups—whether social classes or ethnic groups— possess genetic characteristics that predispose them to inferior educational and economic performance. (In 1994, reviving some very old ideas, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray argued in their book The Bell Curve that genetic characteristics caused “lower intelligence” among African Americans. As we discussed in Chapter 3 , however, the book’s poor methodology and flawed data drew extensive criticism from social scientists. * ) The influence of Spencer in the Gilded Age should not be exaggerated, however. Many Americans did not read him, and others ignored those portions of his teachings that urged the elimination of social programs. But his deification of affluent persons struck a responsive chord with many Americans during a period of phenomenal economic growth. Where Americans had once romanticized yeomen farmers, they now glorified affluent industrialists and businessmen within urban settings. Industrialists could not have wished for a more receptive environment! Analyze the Inadequacy of a Primitive W elfare State The three central experiences of this era—the frontier, the Civil War, and industrialization—posed different social welfare challenges. Each benefited many persons, yet each created social casualties—in particular, displaced Native Americans and Spanish-speaking persons, Asian immigrants, destitute farmers, and exploited laborers on the frontier; freed slaves and poor white refugees during and after the Civil War; and workers who were unemployed, underpaid, or disabled during the early stage of American industrialization. Americans during the Gilded Age glamorized the successes, paid relatively little attention to the casualties, and chose not to construct policies to alleviate suffering. The nation virtually pursued a policy of genocide toward Native Americans and Spanish-speaking persons. Asian and Latino laborers were deprived of their fundamental rights and subjected to virulent racism in local communities. Freed slaves were left to wander in a racist society and were given scant assistance as they made the difficult transition from slavery to freedom. Industrialists had a free hand to exploit workers— including women and children—in dangerous working environments. American interpretations of the frontier, the Civil War, and industrialization are striking in their similarity. Americans idealized the frontier as a place where Christian religion and values were defended against savages; they viewed industrialization as an American success story in which self-made men rose to prominence by dint of hard work; and they perceived the Northern victory in the Civil War as a triumph of morality over the greed of slaveholders and of nationalism over the renegade Southern secessionists. By idealizing positive outcomes of these experiences, Americans more easily rationalized or denied the suffering that accompanied them. LO 4-15 Many Americans interpreted the negative outcomes of these three experiences in a manner that blamed their victims rather than American social institutions and values. In this interpretation, Native Americans caused their own demise by not farming land or by unleashing “unprovoked” attacks on white settlers. Their problems, settlers reasoned, surely arose because of their savage nature rather than because the settlers took their land. Asians and Latinos were perceived as the bearers of alien religious and cultural traditions that imperiled the culture of the white settlers; white laborers were apt to accuse them of stealing scarce jobs. Most Americans believed that the slaves, once freed, were given the same “fair shake” that had been extended to white immigrants; their lack of economic success was commonly attributed to personal shortcomings rather than to the racism of their society or the intrinsic difficulties in making a transition from slavery. Likewise, it was widely believed that any person in industrial society could achieve social mobility by working hard; consequently, union demands for fair pay were often viewed as the work of foreign agitators who wanted to introduce alien socialist institutions. Moral treatment was an intervention based on the assumption that the moral character of individuals was the most potent factor in shaping their destinies, but this assumption was untenable when applied to landless, uneducated, and impoverished former slaves, who were released into a Southern society that detested them; to Native Americans, whose land was taken by false treaties or violence; and to the urban poor, who were at the mercy of exploitative employers and an unstable economy. Few Americans in this era could even envision a major and ongoing social policy role for the federal government. The federal civil rights legislation, the Freedmen’s Bureau, and the stationing of troops in the South represented remarkable departures from the limited role of the federal government prior to the war, but these were ultimately regarded as temporary measures. Lacking a tradition of federal intervention, Americans were disinclined to regulate the emerging industrial order or to develop federal policies to distribute free lands to impoverished persons. Although the federal government did enact pensions for Civil War veterans, as we have seen, these expenditures were very limited and did not set a precedent for an expanded federal role in social welfare. Nor did states and local governments evolve robust social programs to meet the needs created by the frontier, the Civil War, and industrialization. Governments were poorly funded. They were often corrupt, with corporate interests freely bribing public officials so they would not regulate them and would give them large subsidies. Even the spartan set of mental institutions and poorhouses, respectively at state and local levels, were relatively inhumane places where the mentally ill and poor were warehoused. Each of the three central experiences of this era also unleashed powerful political forces that prevented Americans from grappling with social problems. In the decades following the Civil War, the powerful and affluent agricultural interests who had instituted slavery regained their power in the South, established a strong Southern constituency for the Democratic Party, and successfully bargained in the Congress for withdrawal of Northern troops and lifting of federal pressure to honor the civil and voting rights of freed slaves. (Northern entrepreneurs who bought, sold, and profited from Southern cotton and tobacco and favored the use of the former slaves as cheap labor aided them.) American land policy at the frontier empowered speculators, white settlers, and railroads, who pressured public authorities to repress Native Americans or place them on reservations. A new and powerful class of entrepreneurs created by industrialization resisted unions and regulatory policies of the government. By the end of the 19th century, Americans had developed a conservative consensus that embraced moralistic and punitive stances toward persons in poverty, embodied a restrictive concept of social obligation, portrayed social problems as temporary rather than endemic to the social fabric, and favored limited government. Especially striking, however, was the inability of most Americans to support compensatory strategies to help populations that needed special assistance. Most Americans believed that government risked favoritism if it singled out specific groups for assistance. No group in American history possessed such desperate needs as the freed slaves, whose economic problems stemmed so clearly from the horrors of slavery. The disinclination of Americans to use compensatory strategies in cases of obvious need during the 19th century represents a legacy of lost opportunity that has influenced social welfare policy to this day, as well as the well- being of African Americans who still have not received compensation for the misery that Americans caused by policies of slavery and failure to enact permanent civil rights legislation until 1964 and 1965. (Some Southern states finally apologized to African Americans for slavery, but not until 2007.) Indeed, the major policy roles of the federal government in the Gilded Age involved concessions to corporations. The government repressed strikes on key occasions, issued rulings that chilled union organizing, gave huge land grants to railroads, raised tariffs to protect manufacturing (often at the expense of consumers), and failed to enact regulations—such as workplace safety standards—that curbed the greed of corporations. Link the Period of Lost Opportunities to Contemporary Society EP 5a We can learn about policy practice and policy advocacy from notable reformers in the 19th century, as well as how some unmet needs and policy issues in this era persist today. We can identify policy successes in this period that have utility in contemporary American society. We can learn about the structure of the American welfare state from policy developments in this era. LO 4-16 What W e Can Learn from Policy Practitioners and Advocates of the 19th Century We have already presented profiles in policy practice and advocacy for Dorothea Dix in Insert 4.4 , Elizabeth Cady Stanton in Insert 4.6 , and Frederick Douglass in Insert 4.10 . We now present one for radical organizer Eugene Debs, who sought policy changes in a very inhospitable context where racism, sexism, and classism were dominant features of the American cultural and political landscape. Eugene Debs attacked the rampant economic inequality of a nation in the early stages of industrialization. Just as Douglass had personally experienced racism in his life, Debs experienced animus toward working people in his stint with the Terre Haute and Indianapolis Railway, where workers experienced extraordinary rates of fatality and injury (see Insert 4.12 ). Insert 4.12. Proﬁles in Leadership: Eugene V ictor Debs (1855–1926) Eugene Victor Debs—labor union organizer, founder of the American Socialist Party, and several-time presidential candidate—is best remembered as one of the most popular crusaders of the labor and social movements in American history. He was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, on November 5, 1855, the third of six children born to Marguerite “Daisy” (Bettrich) Debs and Jean Daniel Debs. His parents were Alsatian immigrants who arrived in the United States in 1849. Turning his back on his father’s substantial land holdings, Daniel Debs, a well-educated and intensely romantic man, became a manual laborer once in the United States. With the help of Marguerite, who was a millworker, he later was able to open a grocery and butcher shop that brought the Debs family into the prosperous middle class. After dropping out of high school at the age of 14, Eugene Debs was employed by the Terre Haute and Indianapolis Railway, first as a locomotive cleaner and then as a fireman. He worked in railroading for five years before finally heeding his mother’s warnings that the work was dangerous and likely to lead to his early death. Upon leaving his railroad job, Debs was hired as a billing clerk at a local business. Shortly thereafter, Debs became an elected city official, assuming the duties of city clerk of Terre Haute in 1879. In 1885, after two terms in the city clerk’s office, he was voted to the state legislature. He refused to run for reelection because he felt he was ineffective. After his term in the state legislature expired, Debs became involved with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen (BLF). His ambition led him to take on the job of secretary of the local lodge and subsequently editor of the BLF national journal, The Locomotive Fireman’s Magazine. So impressed with his hard work and dedication were the union’s officials that they promoted him to secretary-treasurer and moved the BLF headquarters to Terre Haute. By the time of his resignation as secretary-treasurer in 1892, Debs had been instrumental in increasing BLF membership from 2,000 to 20,000. His work at the BLF consumed most of his time and energy, leaving little for his wife, Katherine Metzel, who suffered much from loneliness and isolation. Although he was initially opposed to strikes and a supporter of craft unionism, Debs later believed that the labor reform movement would be best served by an industrial union of all workers, skilled and unskilled. In 1893, shortly after leaving his position at the BLF, Debs formed the American Railway Union (ARU), which had as its main objective the organization of all railway workers under one central leadership. Following the first major victory for ARU against James J. Hill’s Great Northern Railroad in April of 1894, thousands of unskilled workers became members of the union. By its second national convention, the ARU membership had increased to 150,000. In May 1894, workers at the Chicago-based Pullman Sleeping Car Company, many of whom were members of the ARU, went on strike to protest drastic wage cuts and high rents at the company town. The Pullman management justified their actions by claiming that the wage reductions and high rents were necessary to survive the depression that had begun in 1893. The ARU members responded by boycotting trains to which Pullman cars were attached. As a result, rail traffic from Chicago to the West Coast ground to a halt. Initially, Debs was hesitant in promoting the idea of an all-out boycott of the railways. But once the rank-and-file took action, he had no choice but to support ARU members and lead the strike against the Pullman Company. The strike was quickly named the “Debs Rebellion” by Chicago newspapers. Debs, however, cautioned the strikers to refrain from violent confrontations with Pullman management or strikebreakers. Nevertheless, President Grover Cleveland ordered the military to the area, and over the course of the next few months at least 30 civilians were killed and 60 wounded in riots that broke out between ARU members and American soldiers. When the military presence failed to end the strike, a federal court injunction was issued, setting a far-reaching legal precedent. The injunction ordered the officers of the ARU, among them Debs, to do nothing to further or sustain the boycott. In protest, Debs chose to ignore the injunction, and in July 1894 he was indicted by a grand jury for conspiracy to interfere with interstate commerce. Debs was subsequently charged with civil contempt and, after losing his case in the Supreme Court, was ordered to serve six months in prison at Woodstock, Illinois. Moreover, the ruling in the Debs case sustained the government’s right to enjoin strikes for the next half-century. While Debs was in prison, the ARU collapsed. But Debs’s time in prison would raise his political consciousness. After reading Marx’s Das Kapital and the works of Laurence Gronlund and Edward Bellamy, Debs concluded that the American worker could never get economic justice under capitalism. He left prison determined to devote the rest of his life to crusading for workers’ rights and advocating socialism. In 1897, after supporting the Democratic and Populist candidate William Jennings Bryan, Debs founded the Social Democratic Party of America. In 1900, his party merged with a faction of the Socialist Labor Party to form what became known as the Socialist Party of America. Although he was not an effective party leader, when it came to spreading the socialist message and winning votes, Eugene Debs was unsurpassed. Using his strong oratorical skills, Debs attacked the capitalist structure and extolled the virtues of socialist democracy. In his first presidential election in 1899, Debs amassed nearly 100,000 votes, despite the fact that his party was still in its infancy. He ran again in 1904 and 1908. During the 1908 campaign, he whistle- stopped across the United States on the “Red Special.” In the presidential election of 1912, Eugene Debs attracted nearly a million votes, almost 6% of the national turnout. In 1917, after the United States declared war on Germany and its allies, the Socialist Party convened in St. Louis and voted to oppose the war as a conflict between competing imperialisms and a fight for capitalism rather than democracy. In the months following the vote in St. Louis, Debs refrained from speaking out against the war for fear of being arrested. But after witnessing many other Socialist leaders being jailed for their stand in opposition to the war, Debs spoke out in Canton, Ohio. In June 1918, Debs was arrested by federal authorities and charged with violating the Espionage Act. For speaking out against a war he viewed as unjust and unjustified, Eugene Debs was given a sentence of 10 years in prison. Even in prison, Debs remained true to his crusade for social reform. With the aid of a ghostwriter, he attempted to publish a number of articles dealing with the prison environment. Most newspapers, however, refused to run the pieces, and it wasn’t until 1927, after his death, that they were published as Walls and Bars. In 1920, Eugene Victor Debs, who ran a presidential campaign from behind bars, again won nearly 1 million votes. On Christmas Day in 1921, President Warren Harding ordered him to be released from prison due to his deteriorating health. Debs, whose character was such that he became a legend in his own lifetime, died on October 20, 1926. Debs’s career illustrates the pivotal role the trade unions have played in seeking social reforms in the United States even if they have had fewer members and less political clout than unions in many European nations in the 20th and 21st centuries. Debs was a pioneer in developing them at a time when they were often ruthlessly suppressed. (Workers did not achieve the right to organize through the use of secret ballots until 1936.) Debs also realized that policy advocates had to intersect with electoral politics to be able to change social policies. After serving a term in the Indiana state legislature, he formed the Social Democratic Party of America to provide a third party alternative to the relatively conservative Democratic and Republican Parties—soon helping to merge it with the American Socialist Party. He then ran for president on successive occasions including 1899, 1904, 1908, and 1912—even running while in prison in 1920. It is easy to dismiss Debs as ineffective even though he attracted almost 6% of the national vote in 1912—and almost that many votes in 1920. Yet his decision to position himself to the far left of the American political spectrum was an honorable choice in an era when corporate and affluent persons paid no federal income taxes prior to 1914 and virtually no local or state taxes and when inequality in the United States was more severe than at any other point in the nation’s history. Like many suffragettes and such notable reformers as Martin Luther King, moreover, Debs was willing to go to prison to make a moral case for unpopular causes—whether for supporting railroad strikes that were ruthlessly and violently repressed by President Grover Cleveland or by publicly speaking against American involvement in World War I. In contemporary society, the placing of Debs in jail by federal officials is regarded as an infringement of his constitutional right to freedom of speech. Today’s freedom of speech is illustrated by the opposition to the Iraq War voiced by both Republican and Democratic presidential contenders in 2007 and 2008—who were not placed in jail! The economic inequality in contemporary America is remarkably similar to that of the Gilded Age—with many experts arguing that the nation is increasingly divided into the haves and have-nots with a diminishing middle class. What We Can Learn from the Persistence of Unmet Needs and Policy Issues during the Early Republic * More than 150 years ago, the efforts of Dorothea Dix and subsequent pioneers in the field of mental health drew attention to the plight of the mentally ill who were subjected to inhumane treatment while confined to jails and prisons for lack of any other available resources. Her work was devoted to changing the response to the mentally ill to include humane treatment and removal from the prison system. She was successful. The activity of those early advocates resulted in the development of an extensive and comprehensive state system of mental health hospitals across the country providing care for the mentally ill that persisted for the better part of a century. Fast-Forward 150 Years from the Mid 1800s to the Early 21st Century The issue is “treatment of the mentally ill.” The question is, “How well treated are the mentally ill today?” What would Dix find if she were to reappear and visit the jails of today? According to Department of Justice statistics, the number of United States residents being held in federal and state correctional facilities and municipal jails had soared to 2.2 million by the end of 2011. * Although this statistic in itself is alarming, of greater concern is the issue highlighted by Human Rights Watch, the largest human rights organization in the United States, which found that of those incarcerated in prisons today, about half the jail and prison population in the United States—1,254,800 men and women— has mental health problems. * As a result of inadequate and inaccessible mental health treatment in the community, people with mental illness often engage in behavior deemed illegal, thus thrusting them into the criminal justice system, which is not designed to deal with mental health issues. Human Rights Watch reports that Bureau of Justice statistics indicate that “51% of state inmates with mental health problems were convicted of nonviolent offenses, primarily drug and property offenses. One in five had no prior criminal sentence. Another one in three were nonviolent recidivists.” * Availability of adequate mental health services in the community prior to the criminal offense could have acted as a deterrent to behavior that resulted in incarceration. Further, even though prisons are housing men and women suffering from serious mental health disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression, Bureau of Justice records indicate that the federal prisons have provided treatment to only about 24% of the inmates identified with mental health problems. * How could this have happened? The problem appeared to be rooted in the mid 1800s. History tells us that over time, disillusionment with the established state mental hospital system emerged as incidents of physical neglect, physical abuse, and sexual exploitation of the patients crept into the system. Due to poor funding, moreover, these institutions often became severely overcrowded and understaffed. Many persons were “warehoused” for decades with little or no treatment. Additionally, attitudes within the society were changing as increased emphasis was placed on the civil rights of citizens. Involuntary commitment to long-term care was no longer seen as a viable option in our society. Segregation of the mentally ill in hospitals became a questionable practice. With the advance of medical science and the emergence of psychotropic drugs in the mid 1900s, the attention paid to civil rights of all individuals in the society including the mentally ill, plus the rising costs of providing services for the mentally ill, policy makers fashioned a new response to treatment of mental illness that focused primarily on deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill by providing ongoing treatment in community-based mental health centers. Lawmakers quickly adopted the concept, and between the 1960s and the 1980s the large state-operated mental health hospitals were systematically dismantled. Problems were generated, however, when funding for the proposed community mental health centers was never fully implemented. A gap formed when the old system for treatment of the mentally ill was gone and the new proposed system never became available to the majority of those in need. Some of today’s prison systems have responded to the current problem by incorporating mental health services into the correctional system itself. In a 2006 PBS documentary, The New Asylums , Reginal D. Wilkinson, the director of the Ohio Department of Corrections, a system touted for its forward-thinking approach to dealing with mental health issues of inmates, states that when he was appointed to his current position, “In addition to becoming the Director of the Ohio Department of Corrections, I became a de facto director of a major mental health system.” Mental health services are provided within model programs like the corrections system in Ohio, but the primary purpose of the services is to improve the management of inmates within the prison system. Additionally, for inmates who are released, there is no community system of mental health services in place that can maintain the improved level of functioning achieved while in prison. This results in a high rate of readmission of the mentally ill to the prison system. For the most part, the mentally ill have been left with no safety net and in many cases no services whatsoever. Jamie Fellner, director of the U.S. Program at Human Rights Watch, writes, “… the United States succeeded in shutting down the large, barren public mental health hospitals in which hundreds of thousands of people with mental illness were involuntarily confined and received little treatment. It now involuntarily confines hundreds of thousands of people with serious mental illness in large, barren prisons in which they receive little treatment. Prisons are today’s mental health facilities.” * The plight of the mentally ill today is strikingly similar to that encountered by Dorothea Dix in the mid 1800s. The mentally ill were then and are now being confined to prisons and jails for lack of other options. Because the response to the problems of the mentally ill promoted by Dix and other mental health advocates of the time advanced the cause of the mentally ill, resulted in more humane treatment of the mentally ill, positively contributed to the development of the field of mental health as we know it today, and in general was a very positive step forward in the treatment of the mentally ill, one could suggest that there are lessons to be learned for advocates today from her approach to the problem. Analyzing the processes used by Dix that were successful in effecting change and understanding the key issues then and now could enable current advocates to build on past successes and create more effective strategies tailored to meet the challenges of mental health care in the 21st century. The problem of abuse and discrimination against the mentally ill is not new. What is new is the need for solutions consistent with the times to address the problem in the context of modern society. A study of the work of Dorothea Dix and other advocates of her time provides us with a picture of a response that was appropriate and effective in the mid-19th century and for many years thereafter. The effective intervention and change strategies utilized then are foundational to the work of advocates addressing this ongoing and persistent social problem today. What We Can Learn from Failed Policy Strategies of the Early Republic We must remember when criticizing social service strategies in the early Republic that virtually no scientific data existed about the causes of specific social problems such as substance abuse, mental illness, child abuse, or child neglect. Partly because of this dearth of knowledge, as well as the tendency in this era to equate any social problem with moral lapses or sinfulness, the early Republic resorted to widespread construction of institutions where persons could be regulated and given moral instruction, as well as required to participate in religious ceremonies. Morality has its uses but is a flawed strategy for dealing with social problems that stem from physiological, mental, familial, relationship, or other causes. Yet moral approaches to persons with social problems still strongly persist in contemporary society. Homeless persons are often viewed as morally defective, as are persons with sexual disorders or mental disorders, persons who are convicted of crimes, and those who are involved in substance abuse. We are gradually moving toward evidence-based practices in contemporary society even if many social problems still elude effective solutions. Moreover, a best-practices approach still competes with moral views of many social problems, making it difficult to surmount ancient prejudices. The Gilded Age has some other lessons for contemporary America: the hazards of extreme economic inequality when there are no strong countervailing forces to balance the influence of corporations. With relatively weak unions and weak-kneed public officials often receiving bribes from corporate tycoons, no method of bolstering immigrants’ wages existed, such as a minimum wage. Nor could unions force corporations to raise wages when strikes were often brutally suppressed by corporations and the government—and when corporations were free to fire workers who tried to organize unions. So the nation had many strikes (37,000 of them from 1881 to 1905), but they had little effect in raising workers’ wages. With millions of immigrants in the United States, moreover, corporations could easily fire workers because they knew that other immigrants, desperate for resources, would take their place. Many immigrants could be easily intimidated by employers because they had come from authoritarian nations where working-class persons had few rights—and because they feared deportation. Inequality was fostered, moreover, by American tax policies. Believing that the Constitution did not enable the federal government to levy an income tax on persons and corporations, reformers did not get the 16th Amendment to the Constitution enacted until 1913—meaning that the federal government lacked any method of curtailing the wealth of America’s affluent class of tycoons or its corporations. Their wealth grew at remarkable rates as the nation industrialized—and they succeeded in enacting protective tariffs so that corporations in other nations could not compete with them. The growth of wealth of the top quintile of the American population has vastly outstripped the rate of growth of the bottom two quintiles—leading to a contemporary America that many economic experts compare to the Gilded Age. What We Can Learn from Promising Policy Strategies of the Early Republic Americans placed extraordinary emphasis in the early Republic upon creating opportunities for citizens through widespread distribution of land and the development of public education. We take the American emphasis on creation of opportunities for granted, not realizing how unusual it was compared with European nations in the early part of the 19th century. However, Americans in contemporary society risk not realizing the promise of promoting opportunities for their citizens, particularly ones who would gain the most from subsidized childcare, job training, subsidized scholarships in community college, and universal preschool. Public expenditure in these social investments by the federal government actually decreased from 1978 and 2014 when measured in constant dollars. President Barack Obama has proposed considerable increases in funding for community colleges to help the United States prepare more youth for jobs in its economy, but he had little success in this and other social reforms due to a Congress gridlocked between the two major parties. As I discuss in Chapter 13 , the prospect for increased domestic spending during the presidency of Donald Trump appears bleak. Drafts of his budget in 2017 propose deep cuts in Supplemental Nurtition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid. He liked medical legislation in the House of Representatives that proposed to throw 23 million persons off medical insurance— legislation that had not been enacted by October 2017 because of staunch opposition from a few Republicans and all Democrats in the House of Representatives. It is difficult to locate policy successes in an era with vast social needs and only a primitive welfare state. None of the safety net programs that we take for granted existed in this era—and only a minimal set of poorhouses and mental institutions, even if the nation was well on its way toward creating universal public education through high school. Some private charities existed as well as a growing number of private hospitals that were usually organized by religious denominations. We can learn much today from the empowerment strategies of immigrants in the Gilded Age. Often destitute and subject to virulent discrimination from employers and other residents, millions of immigrants managed to improve their lot by resorting to empowerment strategies. Irish American immigrants, vilified by many Americans, developed tight-knit communities in Eastern and Midwestern cities. The Catholic Church provided them with food, resources, and schools. They formed associations that organized social events. Jewish immigrants similarly banded together in New York City and elsewhere. Not only did they develop synagogues, but also formed after-school tutoring and cultural groups. Those Jews who formed businesses, such as small retail operations or larger factories, hired their fellow Jews in a mutual self-help strategy. Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Italian, and other groups of ethnic immigrants used similar strategies. Members of these ethnic groups sought citizenship at the earliest possible moment by helping one another learn sufficient English and American history to pass citizenship classes. Attaining citizenship, they realized, would give them the power to vote, which they could then use to advance the collective interests of their specific ethnic group. Those elected candidates who got into office because of their votes were then beholden to them, providing patronage jobs in sanitation, fire, police, and other departments. Elected officials provided contractors from their communities with jobs—and these contractors then hired persons from their own ethnic communities to provide the labor for projects such as building and repairing roads; constructing and maintaining sewage and electrical systems; and building local transportation systems. If elected officials failed to deliver these concessions, specific ethnic groups voted them out of office. In effect, then, ethnic groups built their own welfare states in a nation that possessed only a primitive one. This survival strategy helped them to cope with recessions, illness, poor housing, and disability. Because virtually no federal programs and few state ones existed, local governments became a key part of the American welfare state in the mid and late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. They supplemented the existing network of city and political connections with mutual self-help projects within their own communities. Cohesive ethnic communities carried with them, as well, some negative features. As the 2002 film Gangs of New York illustrated, ethnic communities often warred with one another through ethnic gangs, who sometimes attacked members of other ethnic communities who entered their communities. Members of specific ethnic groups sometimes dominated the workforce of specific factories and excluded members of other ethnic groups from joining them. Ethnic conflict often disrupted public schools. Considerable corruption existed in local political institutions, with widespread bribery used to get city jobs and contracts. A key challenge facing designers of modern welfare states is to fashion links with informal neighborhood institutions to better help persons with specific social needs rather than only working through formal institutions such as welfare offices, public hospitals, and employment agencies. What We Can Learn from the Early Republic about the Structure of the American W elfare State A veritable explosion of nonpublic charities—usually connected with Christian churches in an era when relatively few Jewish, Muslim, or Buddhist Americans existed—took place in the early Republic. Many denominations sponsored orphanages; the Sunday School movement; houses of refuge for youth; institutions for the deaf, blind, and “feeble minded”; societies to prevent pauperism; secondary schools; and colleges. (Later in the century, many denominations built hospitals.) The Catholic Church became a key resource for Irish immigrants prior to and after the Civil War. This explosion of nonpublic and usually church-sponsored charities created a useful supplementation of public agencies partly because public services were poorly funded. A wider range of options for social and educational services had become available in the American welfare state. Yet the development of church-sponsored social welfare would invite controversy roughly 150 years later in contemporary society. With separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution, would charities supported by specific religions proselytize their users even when individuals did not wish to be converted? Are “faith-based services” more or less effective than services provided by nondenominational charities? To what extent should social services provided by religious groups receive subsidies by governments? Even though many ethnic communities have vanished in contemporary society as their members have left enclaves and assimilated into the broader society, many persons with specific social problems do not use formal services funded by the welfare state, but gravitate toward family, relatives, churches, employers, neighbors, and local institutions. We ought therefore to define some of these informal institutions as resources that are adjuncts to welfare states. Skilled social workers with knowledge of specific communities make referrals to, and work with, these informal systems as surely as they refer clients to formal programs. As we discuss subsequently, the contemporary American welfare state has forged many links with nonpublic entities. It provides tax concessions to millions of Americans to enable them to get health insurance through employers and to encourage employees to establish private pension funds that in many cases provide retirement resources that exceed what persons get from their Social Security pensions. Federal departments such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provide grants and loans to community-based not-for-profit housing groups to construct affordable housing. State and federal authorities allow many religious charities to receive contracts and grants from public agencies if they form special entities that provide services to the public that do not proselytize or provide other religious information to clients. In short, then, we need to include links between government programs and resources with nongovernment entities when we discuss the structure of the American welfare state—and when we discuss referral resources that are available to social workers. We must also realize that many citizens and oppressed populations develop informal mechanisms to address their collective and personal needs.

As the populists lashed out against bankers, Wall Street, and corporations, they obtained a variety of regulatory measures in local and state jurisdictions and developed cooperative storage facilities. Their reform momentum died as quickly as it had started, however, when farm prices improved, limits were placed on rates of railroads, and cooperatives were developed. Moreover, as populism was a rural movement, its impact on urban reform was negligible. Urban reform had to await the turn of the century, when a reform movement known as progressivism developed. It was not a focused reform movement but embraced a variety of antimonopoly, city beautification, civil service, government, and social reforms. Progressives advocated prohibition, laws 1914– 1918 World War I (entry of the United States in 1917) 1916 Margaret Sanger opens ﬁrst birth control clinic in New York City ; passage of child labor legislation by Congress 1918 Supreme Court overrules federal child labor legislation 1920 Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution grants suffrage to women 1921 Enactment of Sheppard-T owner legislation 1924 Enactment of Immigration Act of 1924 to outlaw prostitution, and efforts to limit immigration, along with policies to limit child labor, correct unsafe working conditions, and provide unemployment insurance. The number of reform projects that were included within the progressive movement makes it difficult to establish a profile of the typical progressive reformer. Many were middle-class Americans bewildered by the emergence of massive corporations, big city bosses, and large urban immigrant populations; however, many affluent Americans, political machines, and trade unions also supported various progressive reforms. Members of the Democratic Party or the Republican Party did not dominate progressivism. Despite its amorphous nature, progressivism was the first sustained reform movement in the United States that addressed a variety of urban issues. At the end of this chapter, we discuss what we can learn from the Progressive Era about policy advocacy, social policy, and the structure of the American welfare state in contemporary society. Understand Realities in the Early Stages of Industrial Society EP 2a EP 3a EP 5c Immigrants bore the brunt of industrialization in Northern and Midwestern cities. Around 21 million of the total U.S. population of 92 million in 1914 were immigrants who had arrived since 1880. Major American cities consisted of separate ethnic settlements, each with its own churches, political machines, and newspapers. In the 12 largest cities, 40% of the population consisted of immigrants, and another 20% consisted of second- generation descendants; altogether, 60% of the U.S. industrial labor force was foreign born. * If immigrants prior to 1885 had largely come from northern and western Europe, so-called new immigrants from 1885 to 1924 predominantly came from southern and eastern Europe, particularly Italy, eastern Europe, and Russia. Most Italian immigrants were rural peasants who had been forced to leave villages by an agricultural depression, rising taxes and rents, and competition from factories that mass-produced products that the peasants formerly made in their homes and shops. Husbands or unmarried men often emigrated in hopes of returning to Italy with resources gained in the United States, but ultimately they often decided to pay the transportation costs of LO 5-1 relatives, families, and brides. (In 1908, however, after a bad recession, as many Italians returned to Italy as entered the United States.) Russian Jews, by contrast, were mostly artisans and small merchants whose earnings had been eroded by competition with industrial products and who had suffered appalling persecution. Entire Jewish families emigrated, usually with little desire to return. Steamship companies, whose salesmen promised prosperity for the price of a ticket, wooed both Italians and Jews. But word of mouth was the primary recruiter, as preceding immigrants revealed that American life—though harsh in the industrial cities—was better than conditions in their homelands. As they streamed in torrents along roads to seaports, bandits often robbed them, only to then endure the epidemics of the steamship passage. * Many immigrants were shocked to find themselves in dark and crowded tenements in Eastern and Midwestern cities, which differed from the outdoor living of their native villages. A typical apartment contained two or three rooms with no bathroom or inside toilet; people bathed in a large tub in the kitchen. They moved frequently to pursue better job opportunities, to find less exploitative landlords, or to escape eviction. Traditionally, historians have viewed industrialization as ruining the homogeneous villages of agrarian society and replacing them with urban ethnic enclaves that were unpleasant places to live. To be certain, different ethnic groups did establish their own enclaves. For example, Polish, Jewish, and Italian areas were remarkably separate from one another. Moreover, these enclaves possessed many social problems. In the absence of public health regulations and modern refrigeration, food poisoning was commonplace. Medications sold on street corners and in pharmacies were touted as cure-alls for many conditions but often contained toxic substances or had no medicinal value. Residents lived in fear of devastating fires. Immigrants lived in dilapidated and crowded tenement buildings that often were fire hazards (see Figure 5.1 ). The hastily constructed wooden tenements, many of them home to hundreds of families, were potential incinerators in the absence of housing codes. In some cases, entire sections of cities burned, as in Chicago in 1871 and in San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. In 1911, the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company in New York City killed 146 girls and women, many of whom were impaled on iron fences after they leaped from a 10-story building with no fire escapes. This catastrophe mobilized pressure for fire and occupational safety regulations. High levels of crime existed in American cities. Street gangs from different ethnic enclaves preyed on one another. Figure 5.1. Details Library of Congress/Corbis HistoricalGetty Images Overcrowded tenement housing in New Y ork circa 1900. Despite these problems, however, we should not overlook immigrants’ ability to craft a range of institutions to help them cope with adversity. The immigrants brought with them their customs, which differed markedly from American practices. Children and adolescents were subject to strict discipline and generally remained with their families until they married. Daughters’ marriages were often arranged by the family. Although fathers had ultimate authority, mothers collected the paychecks of all working members, purchased household goods, and parceled out sums to each family member. The immigrants shopped in crowded outdoor markets or from ever-present peddlers who sold produce on the streets. They paid substantial sums to companies selling health insurance, life insurance, and funeral benefits. Often with the aid of the Catholic Church, synagogues, or fundraising efforts in their communities, they constructed a range of self- help and benevolent organizations that helped them during adversity. Each of the immigrant groups organized itself, as well, within the political process; they often linked themselves to political machines that provided members of their groups with jobs, protection, and community amenities. Fearing hospitals, which they associated with death, they generally relied on midwives drawn from their own communities, as well as purveyors of folk medicine. The institutions of these urban ethnic enclaves, as well as the jobs and protections they received from political machines, allowed them to cope with a hostile environment in the absence of the government social policies that we take for granted today (see Insert 5.2 ). * Insert 5.1.

Critical Analysis: Nongovernment Instruments The term social policy usually connotes government policies, such as legislation and government budgets, but immigrants constructed and used an array of nonpolicy instruments to protect and advance their interests, such as political machines, self-help organizations, and charitable agencies. Moreover, people often fend off economic hardship by personal strategies —for example, by owning assets like homes, purchasing insurance policies, and hiring relatives as employees in family businesses. Compare and contrast nonpolicy strategies used by persons of low income, such as immigrants in the early 20th century, with strategies used by more affluent people. Even with immigrants’ ingenuity in using nonpolicy strategies, was there a level playing field? What kinds of policy enactments, in eras after the progressive period, provided low-income persons with survival resources and services that supplemented or supplanted their nonpolicy instruments? Nor were these urban enclaves temporary. When ethnic groups moved to obtain better housing, they moved en masse to new locations. Although historians once thought that ethnic traditions eroded quickly as immigrants assimilated, it now appears that many ethnic enclaves persisted for generations, and their members retained considerable portions of their culture. * (Even in the contemporary period, ethic enclaves exist in all large Eastern and Midwestern cities.) Social workers and schools tended to encourage immigrants to adopt American child-rearing practices, medical practices, diet, and clothing and viewed with distaste the immigrants’ outdoor markets, which they believed to be unsanitary. When the children of immigrants quickly adopted American customs, conflict erupted within immigrant families, which often pressured children to accept arranged marriages, not to Americanize their names, to date only with chaperones present, and to speak their own dialect Unfortunately, social workers did not recognize the immigrants’ values and customs as salutary alternatives to the American emphasis on individualism. An ethic of mutual assistance was deeply rooted in the immigrants’ culture; they were extraordinarily generous to one another, exchanged job information, formed many ethnic associations, shared resources during hard times, and supported political leaders who pledged to help them with jobs and food. Social workers tended to believe that immigrant parents were excessively authoritarian, but each family constituted a small welfare state, in which children’s earnings were joined with other family assets and family members cooperated during hard times. The American disdain of the immigrants’ diet, which emphasized potatoes or pasta, was equally misdirected, for this diet allowed them to survive with minimal resources. * While their ethnic enclaves helped them cope with adversity, the immigrants encountered an industrial system that oppressed them. By 1900, many jurisdictions placed curbs on the hours of labor, but poor enforcement meant that six-day weeks and 12-hour workdays were commonplace. To override these statutes, moreover, employers sought to persuade workers to sign “voluntary agreements” to work long hours. Immigrants received abysmal wages. Though $15 per week was needed for survival by families in Pittsburgh in 1909, two-thirds of immigrants earned less than $12.50, and half earned less than $10. Barely half the workers in American industry could survive on one paycheck. * Many workers were even more concerned about the dangerous working conditions than about low pay. Industrialization required the use of labor- saving machinery, but these machines lacked safety devices. Roughly 35,000 Americans were killed and 536,000 injured each year during the Progressive Era. In other words, the number of Americans injured in workplace accidents each year was about the same as the total of those killed or injured during the entire Vietnam conflict of the 1960s. Specific industries were particularly hazardous; 328 railroad workers were killed each month in this era, and 46 deaths and 528 injuries occurred in just one steel plant in South Chicago in 1906. American rates of industrial accidents were far greater than rates that existed in European nations, where factory regulations had been enacted and enforced. American workers were not likely to collect funds from their employers when they sued them after industrial accidents because corporate attorneys were frequently able to delay litigation or to use a variety of legal tactics to place the blame for accidents on the workers. Workers collected in only 15% of disability lawsuits where employers were proved to be negligent. * Employers were unsympathetic to union organizing. Many believed that their workforce, much like their equipment and plant, was their personal property, and they feared that wage increases could bankrupt them in the unpredictable economic climate of this period. Employers used a range of tactics to quell unions, such as lockouts, violence, spies, and private police forces. Local governments and courts frequently helped employers by issuing injunctions against strikes, denying permits for union demonstrations or picketing, threatening to deport aliens, and using police to intimidate or repress workers. Trade unions grew from 447,000 persons in 1897 to more than 2 million persons in 1904, but they were usually relatively weak because they focused on skilled crafts rather than the unskilled workers who dominated the steel, garment, meat-packing, and other basic industries. Nor was it easy for immigrants to organize unions across ethnic groups because they spoke different languages and often harbored considerable prejudice against other nationalities. * Periodic recessions were devastating to workers. In many jurisdictions, 30% of the labor force was unemployed in the depression of 1893, which lasted until 1897 and was a grim forerunner of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Unemployment was not buffered by insurance, Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), and other programs that contemporary Americans take for granted. Unemployed persons, who often had no savings, were frequently evicted from their homes and had to obtain meager benefits from breadlines or poorhouses. Social conditions can be summarized with the word insecurity, particularly for persons in the lower third of the economic ladder. Few policies or programs existed to protect persons from disease, poverty, discrimination, disability, crime, fires, and poor living conditions. It often seemed to citizens of humble means that social predators endangered them at every juncture, whether employers who overworked them, businesses who sold them dangerous foods or medicines, or slum landlords who exacted exorbitant rents. Families were splintered by these adverse economic conditions. When destitute women with young children approached public authorities, they were sometimes told that they could receive assistance only if their children were placed in foster homes or with adoptive parents because officials assumed that their own households were unwholesome—or they voluntarily relinquished them because they could not support them. Many children were pressured by their parents to take jobs at an early age. Finally, families were often divided when their individual members went to different cities to seek work. * Discuss the Genesis of Reform EP 5a EP 5c Social Darwinism, the political power of corporations, and the national preoccupation with upward mobility made it seem unlikely, in 1900, that Americans would develop a major reform movement to address social problems. Political institutions seemed impervious to reform. Most state legislatures met for a few months in alternate years and devoted themselves to housekeeping matters. Government was dominated at all levels by the use of patronage to obtain nomination to political office, to secure electoral victories, and to obtain government employment. In many cities, political machines used ethnic loyalty and the lure of jobs in municipal services to secure the support of ward and precinct workers, who worked to ensure that incumbents were reelected. In local, congressional, and presidential elections, the Democratic and Republican parties delivered nominations to persons who were connected to machines or who could bring corporate donations to the party. In an era dominated by parties and lobbyists, presidents and governors were relatively weak figures who tended not to initiate legislation but to acquiesce in decisions fashioned in smoke-filled rooms. * It seemed that government could not implement social programs or enforce regulations, even if they could be developed. In the absence of a modern civil service, patronage rather than competitive exams was used to fill most positions. Many bureaucrats could be bribed or intimidated by party LO 5-2 officials. Perhaps the most damaging weakness of government, however, was its paltry size; Americans were unwilling to levy sufficient taxes to fund government institutions at any level. In fact, progressive reformers in 1900 had to contend with a primitive welfare state that lacked virtually all of the social programs and policies we regard as essential in contemporary society. As Insert 5.3 and Figure 5.2 suggest, they had to start “from scratch” in their efforts to get even rudimentary reforms in place. Insert 5.3. Critical Analysis: Confronting the (Nearly) Blank Policy Slate When analyzing the challenges confronted by reformers at the turn of the 20th century, we should remember that they lived in a society that possessed few of the policies that we take for granted today. Recall the discussion in Chapter 4 about the social problems that accompany industrialization and urbanization, such as unemployment, unsafe working conditions, poor housing, poverty, and victimization of workers. If we conceptualize ameliorative policies to address these problems as a puzzle, we realize that all of the pieces in Figure 5.2 were missing in 1900. Imagine yourself working as a reformer in a society that lacked most of these policies, as well as government bureaucracies capable of administering them or sufficient taxes to fund them. (As a federal income tax did not yet exist, the primary government revenues consisted of local property taxes, which were absorbed by schools and local services such as police departments.) Where would you start? How would you obtain popular support in a nation whose leaders extolled limited government and in which there was no strong, grassroots pressure for social reforms from groups such as organized labor? Whichever reforms they chose to seek, progressive reformers knew that they would confront determined opposition. Conservatives would argue that many reforms were unconstitutional or too costly—or that they would expand government excessively. Corporate leaders would oppose many of these reforms on the grounds that they would diminish profits or force tax increases. Even charity workers and private charities would often oppose some reforms—for example, welfare programs—on the grounds that government ought to leave charity in their hands. Often desperate for the funds that their children earned, some immigrants themselves could be expected to oppose curtailment of child labor. Undeterred by these realities, progressive reformers pressed forward. We shall ask later in this chapter which pieces in Figure 5.2 they obtained—and which ones they did not obtain. Why did they win certain kinds of reforms but not others? Identify some social policies that Americans used to help persons cope with the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009 and beyond. Figure 5.2. Details The social reform puzzle. Patterns of party support frustrated efforts to develop social reform. Voting patterns were dictated by complicated sectional and ethnic traditions, so that neither Democrats nor Republicans focused on the needs of the working class. Democrats were the dominant party in the South, Republicans had considerable strength in New England, and the two parties divided the votes in the Midwest and West. Various ethnic groups supported one of the two major parties on the basis of local tradition rather than for the party’s positions on social issues. Catalytic Events The depression of 1893, which lingered through 1896, had a decisive effect on the nation. It triggered widespread discontent with the Democrats and President Grover Cleveland, who had the misfortune to be in office during the depression years. Believing that his inactivity and economic policies had caused and sustained the depression, many voters changed their allegiance to the Republican Party. (With the exception of Woodrow Wilson, who held the presidency from 1913 to 1920, Republicans dominated national politics until the Great Depression of 1929, when the political balance swung back to the Democrats. * ) The depression of 1893 also brought widespread disenchantment with corporate tycoons; these heroes of virtue, hard work, and success had not been able to usher in unlimited prosperity, as the script of the Gilded Age had dictated. Their willingness to fire workers, to shut down plants, and to use violent means of suppressing labor strikes during the depression tarnished their reputations. Many Americans read in the newspapers about industrialists’ blatant efforts to garner special treatment for themselves and their corporations by bribing public officials or by threatening to relocate to other jurisdictions that promised more favorable tax concessions. Outlandish efforts to bribe politicians and to finance their campaigns were publicized. The flamboyant lifestyles of corporate executives—once considered a just reward for hard work—came to be resented when more than 25% of adult males were unemployed in many areas. * Some Americans began to wonder whether the fantastic growth of industry might be a mixed blessing. Industrialization had seemed at first to represent a new economic frontier that, like the Western frontier, could lead to unlimited opportunities for millions of Americans. But small entrepreneurs were increasingly driven from business by the ruthless tactics of corporate entrepreneurs, who managed to aggregate vast economic empires. Many Americans grew alarmed at the size and power of corporations, which prompted doubts that they could be effectively regulated. Lurid stories about the victimization of hapless workers, women and children among them, tarnished the reputation of industrialists. Reports of adulterated food, unsafe medicines, and other defective products convinced many Americans that corporate executives needed to be restrained by enactment of regulations. Social reform thrives when culprits are identified; their perceived infamies inflame the passions of the public and inspire efforts to regulate them. As tycoons were forced from their pedestals, they were subjected increasingly to proposals to limit their power over labor, to curtail the size of their companies, and to limit their ability to bribe politicians. Intellectual Ferment and Aroused Public Opinion The nation’s major policy swings have been associated with shifts in emphasis between environmental and personal explanations of social problems. During conservative periods—such as the Gilded Age, the 1920s, the 1950s, and the 1980s—the focus is on personal and moral problems. In reform periods—such as the Progressive Era, the 1930s, and the 1960s— attention shifts to environmental factors. Historians do not know why these tidal swings in public opinion occur. By the turn of the 20th century, many Americans believed that environmental factors, such as overcrowding, tenements, and poor working conditions, thwarted the healthy development of city dwellers. Many progressives also feared that political machines, large corporations, and widespread corruption threatened democratic institutions. An environmental focus was critical to the development of a reform movement. When the public’s attention was drawn to various environmental conditions that were believed to cause social ills, support for social reform to modify those conditions increased. In the Gilded Age, reform was deterred by the conventional wisdom that the American Constitution was sacrosanct and should be interpreted literally and that the meaning of life derived from work, competition, and upward mobility. * By the late 19th century, however, many Americans questioned these verities. They countered the Social Darwinists’ argument that life should be devoted to competition, for example, with the assertion that cooperation and creativity were higher values. Ministers known as “social gospellers” argued that the gospel required people to help the downtrodden. Social workers like Jane Addams and philosophers like John Dewey believed that people were intrinsically cooperative and became competitive only when they were exposed to environmental cues and models— including an American culture that emphasized winning at all costs. Addams extolled a “cooperative ideal” when she contended that government should try to instill a spirit of cooperation in its citizens, whether through example (by developing social programs, for instance) or through education. She argued that regulations and social programs represented expressions of altruism rather than unwarranted interference in the private affairs of industrialists and citizens. * (We will discuss Jane Addams near the end of this chapter.) Addams and other reformers wondered how the competitive and materialistic values of Americans could be transformed. Unlike European radicals and socialists, who romanticized the working class and believed that its victory over bourgeois interests would transform society, Addams idealized different groups at different points in her career. She variously hoped that immigrants would infuse American society with their simple peasant and altruistic virtues; that the creativity and playful virtues of youth would be emulated by others; and that women would transform American society by asserting values of nurturance that stemmed from their family roles. Although each group proved unequal to her high expectations, she seemed never to become disillusioned. * Many reformers also contended that unregulated economic activity would create unacceptable levels of social distress. Whereas economic theorists in the 19th century had commonly argued that the natural balance of supply and demand was disrupted when government exacted taxes or regulated hours and working conditions, writers like Richard Ely asserted that, unless regulated, business practices concentrated power in the hands of elites, who consigned workers to poverty and diverted their own wealth into nonproductive ventures such as speculation and corporate takeovers. * A phalanx of theorists questioned provisions of the Constitution and the American legal system. Some argued that the Constitution constructed by the founding fathers adequately addressed the needs of an agricultural republic but was inadequate for an industrial society, which required government to assume an active role in economic and social affairs. Many progressives thought that the Supreme Court did not have the right to overrule progressive social legislation, and they proposed legislation to circumscribe its powers. * Progressives also began to question whether America was a model society that should be emulated by the rest of the world. The nation had led the way in opening opportunities to citizens by enacting universal suffrage, land ownership, and education, but it had lagged in providing security to its citizens. On extensive trips to Europe, social workers Jane Addams and Grace Abbott, as well as other reformers, discovered various social programs and regulations that offered support for workers and families. * Some reformers attained extraordinary popularity in the Progressive Era; in public opinion polls, for example, Jane Addams was voted the most exemplary American. Politicians of both parties who espoused various reforms were elected in large numbers to local, state, and national legislatures. As progressives opened up the political process by allowing voters to place issues (so-called initiatives) on the ballot, many reform measures were enacted even when legislators showed scant interest in them. The sheer number of progressive measures enacted in cities and states attests to the popularity of reform during this period. Some historians have used concepts from social psychology to explain why middle-class Americans became more interested in reform in certain periods. Richard Hofstadter, for example, argued that middle-class Americans supported reform because they feared that corporations and political machines threatened their economic and social roles. It seems unlikely, however, that a single motivation explains this swing in public opinion. Different persons and groups probably supported reform for different reasons. Many Americans supported reform because of personal exposure to social ills; they read about the corruption of officials whom they had elected, trembled when epidemics struck their cities, read about or saw corporate executives’ flaunting of power, or ate food or consumed drugs that made them unwell. Religion should not be ignored as a motivating force for reform in the Progressive Era. Many middle- and upper-class Americans felt guilty about the sorry condition of the bottom third of their society and the victimization of women and children by employers. Some realized, despite their prejudices, that the economic institutions from which they derived personal benefit were fueled by immigrants’ labor. * Furthermore, pragmatism propelled many Americans toward reform as they became convinced that conservative policies had not been effective. While conservatives in the Progressive Era continued to voice the laissez-faire homilies of the Gilded Age, they were on the defensive because reformers successfully argued that their policies had led to a disastrous depression, the victimization of women and children, and the rise of monopolies. The fruits of capitalism had failed to reach some of the desperately poor immigrants who crowded American cities. * Although portrayed by conservatives as outside agitators or socialists, reformers were able to enlist popular support by employing a symbolism that seemed respectable and American. They spoke of saving the American family, saving children, opening up politics to the people, increasing economic opportunity, and preventing poverty and crime. Many Americans believed that the family was in a state of serious decline because children and women had to work, women were separated from their children when they applied for assistance, and children were placed in prisons because of the lack of juvenile facilities. Americans also feared that their political institutions were increasingly dominated by political machines or corrupt politicians. They favored proposals to save democracy itself, including placing policy proposals on the ballot (so voters could bypass elected officials) and instituting the civil service so that many government positions would be filled through competitive exams rather than through patronage. Trust-busting was defended on the grounds that it would enhance economic opportunity for ordinary citizens. When it was perceived as addressing these noncontroversial goals, reform obtained widespread support. * Many Americans in the Progressive Era also believed that they were rediscovering their own land. The rhetoric of the Gilded Age had suggested that the nation was free of problems and on a path of unlimited prosperity, democracy, and territorial expansion. By the turn of the century, however, reformers and journalists engaged in a frenzied search for factual evidence of social problems, such as the number of children and women exposed to dangerous working conditions, the number of children placed in adult prisons, the toxicity of many drugs, high rates of infant mortality among specific groups, and instances of political corruption. The appetite for facts and figures was insatiable; the social worker and reformer Paul Kellogg, for example, initiated an exhaustive six-volume survey of social conditions in Pittsburgh that described occupational hazards, housing, health, and other facets of residents’ lives. * As social facts were discovered, they were disseminated to the public through popular and professional journals and newspapers. Reforming journalists, popularly known as muckrakers, dramatized their findings by highlighting the evil nature of the wrongdoers and the innocence (and vast number) of the victims. Professionals and academics presented findings in more neutral terms. In either case, the general public was fascinated by the endless evidence of wrongdoing and suffering, which bolstered support for reform. The Specter of Social Unrest Progressive leaders were largely unconcerned with the possibility of social unrest by the millions of immigrant workers who provided cheap labor for American industry. With notable exceptions, most workers were relatively tranquil in this period despite their appalling working and living conditions. Immigrants who did not speak English, who lacked citizenship, who often hoped to return to Europe, and who feared unemployment, were not likely to engage in militant protest. Most women were not amenable to strikes because they hoped to work only for a brief period before marrying. Still, the emergence of fringe—but vocal and radical—organizations, such as the Socialist Party and the Industrial Workers of the World, represented a new phenomenon in the nation. Their leaders espoused ideas that departed from the conventional political beliefs of the nation; many advocated political organization of the working class, supported national strikes, favored the nationalization of some industries, and called for a national minimum wage. As we shall see later in this chapter, fringe parties had scant success in obtaining political offices, except at the mayoral level; nonetheless, they constituted a political threat to many Americans, particularly because the unskilled labor force that they sought to organize was so huge. In this climate, many progressives presented themselves as moderates whose sensible and pragmatic reforms would blunt protest and maintain tranquility. As many scholars have recently analyzed, a dark side of progressivism existed. While often siding with underdogs, many progressives were prejudiced against immigrants, whom they regarded as uncivilized, ignorant, and immoral. Charity workers often wanted to imbue immigrants with middle-class values. Progressives who enacted a modest welfare program for women known as mothers’ pensions wanted to withhold it from immigrant women until they had been investigated to determine whether they deserved assistance and would use it wisely. Furthermore, many progressives were deeply prejudiced against African Americans, as we shall discuss in more detail later. Identify Regulatory Reforms in the Progressive Era EP 1a EP 3b The hallmark of progressives’ reforms were myriad regulations that they got enacted mostly at local and state levels of government, along with some at the federal level of government. Regulations are government rules that establish what corporations, social agencies, public officials, professionals, restaurants, pharmaceutical companies, developers, landlords, employers, bars or taverns, banks, and others can and cannot do. Regulations also come with penalties if persons break them, including fines, revoking of business licenses, and even imprisonment. We take regulations for granted in contemporary society. We assume that employers cannot hire eight-year-old children that pharmaceutical companies cannot put unauthorized toxic chemicals in drugs, and that landlords must provide fire exits in apartment buildings. The primitive welfare state of the year 1900 lacked even these basic rules to guide people’s actions. In their absence, corporations could make dangerous or shoddy products, establish inhumane working practices, and subject workers to hazardous conditions. In the absence of public scrutiny, politicians could accept bribes, hire relatives, and tamper with elections. Homer Folks, a progressive reformer in New York State, found that state institutions were rarely audited, that laundry and food concessions were LO 5-3 awarded to politicians’ friends, that no system of external monitoring existed, and that it was impossible to distinguish staff from residents in some institutions because they were similarly dressed. He conducted a tireless campaign to establish audit, licensing, and monitoring programs for public bureaucracies; to place staff positions under the civil service; to oust political appointees; to establish standards of sanitation; and to enforce existing laws that required children and insane persons to be removed from almshouses. Similar projects were undertaken by many other reformers in other states. * Many of the regulations were obtained only after exhausting political battles. Thus, advocates of child labor laws, who formed reform organizations in each state as well as at the national level, fought those who argued that these laws violated parental rights, that immigrants needed the earnings of their children to survive, and that child labor prevented the overcrowding of schools. Reformers who sought federal labor laws, such as a minimum wage and maximum hours of work, were told that the Constitution did not give the federal government jurisdiction in social matters. The regulatory reforms of the era were supplemented by efforts to rationalize the social services system and to develop a social work profession. The reformers viewed with horror the provision of services by amateurs and political appointees. The National Conference of Charities and Corrections sponsored conventions of administrators and staff of agencies to exchange information and provide training. The New York Charity Organization Society established an annual summer course for social workers in 1898, which was followed in 1903 by the formation of the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy and in 1904 by the New York School of Philanthropy and the Boston School for Social Workers. By 1919, the leaders of 15 schools of social work had formed the Association of Training Schools for Professional Social Work. These early social workers usually identified with private agencies; they tended to view public institutions as last-resort programs for people in extreme poverty, people with mental disorders, and criminals. However, they increasingly departed from the moralistic ethos of 19th-century social service staff (who had used such value-laden labels as deserving and undeserving) by providing services based on the analysis of familial, personal, and neighborhood factors that contributed to their clients’ problems. Instead of dictating to clients and offering personal models of morality, many social workers sought to develop give-and-take exchanges with clients and local interventions. Social work pioneers hoped to professionalize social programs by credentialing their staff in training programs. * Progressive Era reformers such as Jane Addams, who advocated coupling personal service with public sector reforms, came into conflict with social workers who believed private agencies should dominate in the provision of outdoor relief and opposed the development of public programs. But this conflict had diminished by 1909, when Addams was selected as president of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections. * Assess the Limited Social Programs of the Progressive Era EP 1a Although many new regulations were passed into law, the few social programs that were enacted underscored the limited nature of social reform in the Progressive Era, as none of them required the expenditure of large sums of money or the distribution of resources or services to poor persons. The main programs of the day included workmen’s compensation, mothers’ pensions, juvenile courts, the Children’s Bureau, and protections for female workers in various states. LO 5-4 Limited Policy Reforms for W omen and Children The mothers’ pension movement swept the nation between 1911 and 1919, when most states developed such programs. Whereas today most single mothers have been deserted, are divorced, or have had children out of wedlock, in the Progressive Era most single mothers were widows. When they sought government assistance for single mothers, progressive reformers focused on the needs of women who had been widowed, in the belief that such women would be viewed more sympathetically than would women who had been divorced or deserted. Without government assistance, they contended, single mothers—whether widowed, divorced, or deserted— would have to work such long hours that they could not properly care for their children, and many of them would have to continue to divide their families by sending some of their children to orphanages. Mothers’ pensions can be viewed as a first breach in the American orthodoxy that the government should not provide outdoor relief to people in need. Indeed, many progressives hoped that it would be followed by other programs, such as unemployment insurance and old age pensions. But mothers’ pensions were hardly the far-reaching reform that sociologist Theda Skocpol suggests when she contends that Americans constructed a “maternalist welfare state” in the Progressive Era. As Linda Gordon notes, these pensions were granted to relatively few women—only 46,000 women nationally by 1919. Residency and citizenship requirements excluded many immigrants. The programs operated with such low appropriations that long waiting lists often existed. Many applicants were screened out as unsuitable because of health problems or poor housing. Even in Los Angeles, with a reputedly generous program, only 24% of single mothers received public or private assistance. Pensions were so miserly moreover, that large numbers of women who received them had to work. Although legislation rarely indicated that women with out-of-wedlock children or women who had left their husbands could not receive mothers’ pensions, local administrators could and sometimes did exclude them from the program on the grounds that they were morally undeserving. Many states allowed women to receive assistance even when their husbands were still present, but it is likely that such assistance was given reluctantly, lest it reduce the husband’s incentive to work (see Insert 5.4 ). * Insert 5.4. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: The Stigmatizing of Single Mothers As our discussion of mothers’ pensions suggests, single mothers in the early part of the 20th century were viewed as morally suspect by many people, even by many advocates of mothers’ pensions. 1. Speculate why single mothers were widely distrusted in American society in the early part of this century. What policies did progressives institute that reflected this suspicion? 2. What policies might progressives have considered that would have had greater ethical merit than mothers’ pensions? 3. What similarities exist with contemporary portrayals of mothers on Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)? Progressives succeeded in obtaining special courts, known as juvenile courts, in many jurisdictions. Prior to this reform, children were tried in adult courts, detained in jails for extended periods, and remanded to adult prisons, even though houses of refuge and legal precedents that exempted minor children from penalties established for adult offenders already existed in the 19th century. In many jurisdictions, children who were less than 14 years of age were exempted from capital punishment and from other penalties, but these exceptions could be waived in certain circumstances. Judge Ben Lindsey in Denver and many social reformers in Chicago and elsewhere believed that mixing children with adult criminals was harmful to children and that confinement did not address familial, school, and other causes of delinquency. Because probation hardly existed as an option, even children who had committed minor offenses were institutionalized. * When children were tried in juvenile courts, judges and staff could explore their family situations, examine a range of options including probation, and, in principle, refer children to special juvenile institutions when they needed to be committed. In practice, however, judges still lacked innovative community programs to which they could refer juvenile offenders. Furthermore, funding was insufficient to hire the staff needed, the courts lacked bilingual staff able to converse with immigrant children and parents in their native tongues, and most judges lacked training in social matters. The idea of establishing a national Children’s Bureau originated in 1904 in the National Committee on Child Labor, was reaffirmed in a White House Conference on Care of Dependent Children in 1909, and was finally enacted in 1912; it received a meager budget of $25,640, compared with the $1.4 million that funded the federal Board of Animal Husbandry. Conservatives hobbled the agency still further by limiting its authority to data gathering and advisory functions that precluded it from providing resources directly to children or to local units of government. Its dedicated social work staff issued many seminal reports in the succeeding years, but the bureau did not provide a frontal attack on the poverty, malnutrition, or poor health of the nation’s children; furthermore, the bureau tended to avoid controversial issues, such as passage of national child labor laws. Its greatest triumph was the enactment in 1921 of the Sheppard-Towner legislation, which provided federal matching funds for states to provide clinics for pregnant women and young children. However, the American Medical Association (AMA) viewed the program as a competitor to private physicians and succeeded in precluding programs funded by the legislation from providing medical services; thus, the programs were limited to educational and social services. Even this small program was terminated in 1929 on the grounds that it violated states’ rights and represented socialized medicine. * Reformers believed that they had made a lasting breakthrough in 1916 when they finally obtained passage of national legislation to restrict the use of child labor. Specifically, the legislation prohibited interstate commerce of the products of firms that employed children who were less than 14 years of age and mines that employed children less than 16 years of age. However, reformers’ hopes were dashed when the Supreme Court nullified the legislation in 1918 on the grounds that the law fell outside the province of interstate commerce, which had been widely regarded as the only way that child labor laws could be constitutionally legitimized. Although the ruling did not frontally challenge the right of the federal government to regulate child labor, and the staff of the Children’s Bureau was able to obtain measures that prevented federal contractors from using child labor during World War I, the ruling had a chilling effect on social reform at the national level. * Moreover, in 1922, the Court declared unconstitutional a second anti-child labor law enacted in 1919 and based on the national power of taxation. Progressives did obtain minimum wage legislation for women in 15 states and the District of Columbia by 1923, and legislation that established maximum hours of daily labor in 41 states by 1921. For reasons we shall discuss later, these measures applied only to women; it was not until 1938 that federal legislation that covered all workers was enacted. Private Philanthropy When discussing progressives’ reforms, we should remember that they did not wish to supplant private philanthropy with publicly funded programs. Accustomed to the sectarian and privately run institutions that evolved in the 19th century, they strongly supported the continuation of these institutions, as well as the construction of hundreds of sectarian hospitals across the nation as physicians developed surgical and diagnostic techniques that shifted medical practice from their offices and patient homes to institutional settings. Indeed, some social workers opposed certain publicly funded programs, such as mothers’ pensions, on the grounds that they would wrongly supplant private charity. Nor did strict boundaries exist between public and private sectors. Mothers’ pensions were sometimes administered by private agencies. Judges sometimes committed neglected children to sectarian orphanages. Settlement houses often received contracts from public authorities. Middle-class progressive reformers who had not personally experienced social problems made determined efforts to live among immigrants by establishing settlement houses in Eastern and Midwestern cities. Hull House, the settlement house that Jane Addams established in Chicago in 1889, was modeled after Toynbee Hall in London, which had been founded by Arnold Toynbee, an English social reformer. Addams’s Hull House was a remarkable institution. She carefully documented living conditions and the ethnicity of area residents, often as a prelude to seeking corrective legislation from local and state governments. She recruited large numbers of volunteers, who provided an array of services to immigrants. Hull House became a mecca for social reformers in the nation and around the world and held numerous seminars on social problems. Addams sought to organize immigrants against the political machine on the grounds that it was corrupt and did not seek ameliorative reforms. More than 400 settlement houses had been established by 1910, many in white immigrant neighborhoods but some in African American neighborhoods in the North and the South. The settlement houses provided many services and programs, including arts and crafts, vocational training, cultural events, English language instruction, classes preparing immigrants for citizenship, assistance with unionization of workers, voter registration, and health services. Following Addams’s example, the staff of some settlement houses developed surveys of housing and other social conditions in their neighborhoods as a prelude to seeking regulations. We should not idealize the settlement house movement, however. Whereas Addams made social action an important part of Hull House’s program, other settlements were relatively inactive. Many settlement leaders were condescending to immigrants, whom they regarded as ignorant of hygiene, proper diet, and morality. Some sought to convert immigrants to Protestantism. Imbued with the racism of the period, some leaders moved their settlements out of a neighborhood when African Americans moved in, refused to serve them, charged them fees to keep them from receiving services, or opened separate and segregated facilities for them. (Even Hull House had no African Americans on its board as late as the 1930s.) In an era when government funds were rarely used to provide contracts or grants to nonpublic agencies, the settlements’ boards often consisted of affluent people with conservative ideology, which further constrained their social reform work. * Even enlightened settlement staff worked under difficult circumstances. They had to raise funds to support their work, often from conservative people and institutions. The settlements existed in turbulent communities, where successive waves of immigrants moved in and out in complex patterns. The immigrants themselves tended to view the affluent white volunteers and staff as authority figures, and political officials were inclined to view them as competitors for the immigrants’ allegiance. These criticisms of settlement houses ought not to obscure some of their achievements. Unlike the settlement staff, most affluent white Americans avoided the immigrant enclaves of major cities. Those settlement workers who did engage in social reforms provided a style of work that contrasted with that of other private agencies, which often focused on a narrow casework approach, opposed even to such modest policies as mothers’ pensions. The policy practice and advocacy tradition of social work very much derives from the work of reformers such as Jane Addams and other settlement house leaders. Limited Reforms for W orkers and Persons with Mental Illness Employers used a variety of legal defenses to place part or all of the responsibility for work-related injuries on employees. They argued that employees knew about dangers before they took employment; that employees were careless in their work; or that negligence of a fellow employee, rather than negligence of the employer, had caused work-related injuries. Litigation was so time-consuming that workers often died before awards were made to them. Its cost forced many workers into indebtedness and eventually into poor relief programs. Despite their legal successes, employers also found the costs of litigation to be prohibitive; ever-mounting awards to disabled workers and the costs of liability insurance increased their costs of doing business. Workmen’s compensation laws, which had been adopted by virtually all states by 1920, provided a partial remedy that was acceptable to many employers and to some unions. The laws established a state fund that received its revenues from a payroll tax levied on employers. Workers who were injured were entitled to obtain an award, the amount of which was determined on the basis of the specific type of injuries. Under the legislation, workers usually forfeited their right to sue employers. Workers soon discovered that workmen’s compensation was not a panacea. The payment schedules for specific injuries were appallingly low—indeed, far lower than jury awards that had preceded the enactment of workmen’s compensation. Nevertheless, the legislation took the edge off discontent, and consequently eased public pressure to improve workplace safety. Unions were divided in their attitudes to workmen’s compensation; some believed this legislation was an improvement, but others believed it helped employers more than workers. Moreover, workmen’s compensation covered only bodily injuries; in Great Britain, by contrast, industrial diseases were also covered. * The Progressive Era saw the introduction of an initial set of aftercare services for people who had been institutionalized in mental asylums. As late as 1905, virtually no aftercare services existed in the United States; released mental patients had to fend for themselves with no assistance from anyone. Beginning in New York State and expanding to other states, social workers were employed by mental institutions to follow their wards on release and to give them services. Moreover, the work of Clifford Beers, himself a former mental patient who had written about his ordeal in public institutions, led to the establishment of nongovernment societies for mental hygiene in various states, as well as the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, which pressured public authorities to improve mental hospitals and to develop programs to prevent mental illness. Even these reforms failed to assist most persons with mental problems in community settings because they reached only a small fraction of persons due to the poor funding of outpatient clinics by local, state, and federal governments. Analyze Health Reforms within a Flawed Capitalistic Model Contemporary Americans cannot easily understand just how precarious the health of many Americans was at the start of the Progressive Era. As many as 20% of the populations of entire cities were killed by such epidemics as cholera, typhoid fever, and malaria. Children died in great numbers from influenza, whooping cough, measles, and scarlet fever. These health problems partly derived from the poor state of scientific knowledge about health, but major scientific advances at the end of the 19th century meant that the United States could drastically curtail death and injury from these diseases if it found ways to get people inoculated for some of these diseases—and if sanitation was sufficiently improved to prevent the spread of cholera. Notable public health reforms took place during the Progressive Era. Some local governments and private charities established public health centers in many American communities where residents received newly developed inoculations. Hired by local governments, public health inspectors enforced regulations that required sanitary conditions in housing, restaurants, and other businesses—and assumed key roles in upgrading sewer and sanitation systems to avert the epidemics that had devastated cities during the 19th century with malaria, typhoid fever, and cholera. The spread of diseases such as tuberculosis was markedly cut through quarantines of persons with them. The education of physicians, too, was markedly improved with the establishment of licensed medical schools that replaced the odd assortment of unregulated places of training for physicians of the 19th century that sometimes did not even require completion of a high school degree. If medical care had largely taken place in physicians’ offices and patients’ LO 5-5 homes in the 19th century, the construction of hundreds of hospitals by many religious denominations in the early years of the 20th century provided a medical care setting that took advantage of ongoing improvements in surgery and medication. These improvements took place, however, within a flawed two-track model of medical care. Physicians and nongovernment hospitals were funded by fees charged to patients—and patients would pay for these charges from their personal income. Unlike schoolteachers, nurses, and social workers, then, physicians would not be salaried persons, but private entrepreneurs operating in a capitalistic model. This capitalistic model, however, placed many patients in jeopardy since many of them could not afford the fees, whether because they were poor or because they needed expensive care. Rather than using the mainstream model, then, they either went untreated or sought care from public hospitals and clinics funded by cities and counties across the nation. This publicly funded system was often far inferior to the mainstream system and required a demeaning means test. Its institutions were often poorly staffed—and patients were often put in large wards that were meagerly staffed. Many of these so-called medical institutions were part of poorhouses where destitute persons lived and where infirm elderly persons were warehoused. Realizing how unethical a two-track model of health care was, some prescient leaders of the AMA decided during the Progressive Era to explore public systems of health care that would be financed not by patients’ payments but by the government. They proposed that each state establish universal health care funded by tax revenues, but encountered angry resistance from other members of the AMA who contended that universal health care was “socialistic” and “un-American”—and would somehow destroy the patient–physician relationship. These dissenters voted the reform-minded leaders of the AMA out of office—and their perspectives prevailed in the AMA for the next 50 years. Almost single-handedly, the AMA prevented public officials from enacting some form of national health insurance during the Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman administrations —and almost blocked the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. (They cooperated, however, with the administration of Barack Obama to enact the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, which we discuss in Chapter 12 .)Critique the Limited Nature of Progressives’ Social Reforms EP 3a When viewed from the perspective of the 19th century, progressives achieved extraordinary reforms in a brief period of time; they passed a variety of regulations, reforms for women and children, and workmen’s compensation. These reforms required sustained effort over a period spanning 20 years. When viewed from a contemporary perspective, however, the progressives’ reforms underscore the reluctance of the American welfare state. Most important, progressives’ reforms did not require large government expenditures; they did not involve major benefit or service programs. As we have discussed, both mothers’ pensions and Sheppard-Towner services were minuscule programs. Government spending in the United States in 1920 was only 5.5% of the GDP, as compared with 19.1% in Great Britain and 25.5% in France, and a considerable portion of these American expenditures went to veterans’ payments—not only to the surviving veterans of the Civil War and the Spanish-American War but to recent veterans of World War I. * In addition to the political and cultural barriers to reform, which we shall discuss shortly, another serious obstacle was that state, local, and federal governments lacked revenues to fund major social programs, even had the progressives desired them. We have noted that local property taxes were the primary source of government revenues in this period—and they were used primarily for schools and public services. Congress had enacted a federal LO 5-6 income tax in 1894, only to have the Supreme Court declare it unconstitutional. In 1913, to bypass the Court, progressives secured the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which empowered the Congress “to lay and collect taxes on incomes,” but the rates were established at such low levels that most citizens paid no income taxes at all. When a substantial federal income tax was levied to help fund American military efforts in World War I, it was promptly cut drastically during the 1920s so that only about 5% of Americans paid any federal income tax by 1932. Cultural and Policy Realities that Limited Reform Despite their skill in uncovering the devious actions of corporate tycoons and exploiters of powerless populations, progressives were often naive in their approach to social reform. They assumed that regulations would bring dramatic changes when, in fact, they often had negligible effect. The naivety of progressives took two forms. First, their legalistic bias made them assume that laws would lead to dramatic changes in the behavior of wrongdoers, though they soon learned that persons and institutions subject to regulations were resourceful in evading them—whether by co-opting or bribing government officials or by escaping detection because regulatory agencies lacked funds and staff to adequately monitor compliance. Furthermore, their procedural bias led them to believe that changes in the procedures of government would make government dramatically more responsive to the needs of the people; thus, they fought for the passage of such laws as the initiative, the referendum, and the recall, which, respectively, allowed citizens to place legislation on the ballot, to hold popular votes on measures that had already been enacted by legislators, and to vote from office public officials who were believed to be corrupt or misdirected. These measures assumed that an aroused citizenry would vote for progressive legislation; as reformers soon learned, the same techniques could also be used to recall liberal legislators or to place conservative measures on the ballot. (It is an irony of history that conservative initiatives to cut government social spending, such as California’s Proposition 13 in 1978, were one legacy of progressive procedural reforms.) Few persons in the Progressive Era would have argued that regulations to control the actions of industrialists, politicians, and landlords were unnecessary. However, a law enforcement approach, which fostered the use of regulatory strategies, precluded the enactment of major social programs to deliver resources and services directly to these powerless groups. Some progressives sought unemployment insurance, health insurance, and other programs, but many emphasized regulations rather than an array of reforms. In fairness to them, the minimal resources of local, state, and federal governments, as well as the lack of a tradition of government social programs, provided a hostile context for broader reforms. Progressive reformers also diminished their effectiveness by relying on local governments—whether cities, counties, or state legislatures—to take the lead in addressing the mounting social ills of the nation. Child labor laws, workmen’s compensation, mothers’ pensions, and many other reforms were enacted locally; tens of thousands of regulations and proposals were advanced at local levels of government. Local reforms were needed, of course, but national programs offered certain advantages. A strategy of policy localism required expenditure of vast amounts of energy in reinventing the wheel in each of the states and local jurisdictions. Moreover, resistance to reforms in specific localities was often heightened by opponents’ argument that a specific local reform—such as prohibition of child labor—might make industry move to other localities where this restriction did not exist. Because most Americans and some reformers believed that social welfare issues belonged to local governments under the Constitution and by the precedent of the Poor Laws, efforts to secure national reforms occurred belatedly during the Progressive Era and were limited to modest reforms such as the Children’s Bureau. Other national initiatives included the 1916 child labor legislation and the 1910 Mann Act, which prohibited the transportation of women across state lines for immoral purposes. Efforts at the national level were further hampered by the Supreme Court, which continued to limit the power of the federal government—for example, in rulings that restricted the federal government to those functions specifically enumerated in the Constitution. * The range of their interests also diluted progressives’ effectiveness. At least six overlapping reform agendas existed: 1. Some progressives, who emphasized procedural reforms in government, sought policies to reduce corruption, to give more power to experts in governments, and to foster greater participation by citizens in government. 2. Some progressives sought to regulate the economic system, to restrict the size of corporations, or to develop federal controls over banking and currency. 3. Members of professions such as medicine, nursing, law, teaching, and social work sought to develop licensing laws and accredited educational programs to upgrade the knowledge and skills of professionals. 4. Some progressives sought legislation to restore morality to American life by curbing immigration, restricting gambling, ending prostitution, or limiting alcohol consumption. 5. Some reformers focused on regulations to limit the ability of corporations, owners of rental housing, and others to victimize workers or the public. 6. Some progressives pursued programs to redistribute resources to impoverished workers, destitute women, and other groups. Most progressives embraced more than one of these agendas. * The range of the reform agendas limited progressives’ impact in several ways. First, by devoting their energies to many causes and issues, reformers decreased the likelihood that they could significantly affect any one of them. Furthermore, the six agendas received unequal attention; reforms that assisted powerless and impoverished groups tended to attract less support than did other reforms. In particular, trust-busting, good-government reforms (such as the initiative, referendum, and recall), prohibition, and restrictions on immigration absorbed the attention of many reform leaders and the general public. * These emphases reflected the middle-class perspectives of many reformers. Middle-class citizens did not monopolize progressivism; trade unions, political bosses, and immigrant groups supported the six progressive agendas variously. Nonetheless, the middle class shaped the direction and content of many reforms. Relatively affluent persons often had scant personal knowledge of the problems that immigrants and factory workers encountered in their daily lives. Trust-busting, city beautification, civil service, professional licensing, and other such reforms did not directly address the appalling social conditions of poor persons. The prominence of moral reforms during the Progressive Era also suggests the imprint of middle-class reformers, many of whom sought temperance, termination of gambling, elimination of prostitution, and anticrime measures. Some progressive reformers were biased against immigrant groups and sought legislation to limit immigration. Despite valiant attempts, reformers like Jane Addams were unable to prevent Congress from passing anti- immigration legislation, which would have become public law had it not been vetoed by Presidents Taft and Wilson. We have already noted the punitive administration of mothers’ pensions to immigrant widows, who had to convince investigators that they were deserving before the pension would be granted. This middle-class imprint on reform can usefully be contrasted with England and other European nations, where strong political parties dominated by factory workers and radicals were beginning to emerge. While the Labor Party was still in its infancy by 1910, its presence led to competition between the conservative and the liberal parties for workers’ votes—a competition that partly led Lloyd George, the leader of the Liberal Party, to support a range of social legislation. (Ramsay MacDonald became the first prime minister from the Labor Party in 1924.) Even those progressives who most favored social reforms were often uncomfortable with class conflict and had little sympathy for groups that advocated sweeping reforms. * Political Realities that Limited Reform Even had they focused on helping immigrants and workers, the reformers would have had minimal policy successes. The Supreme Court, as well as local and state courts, impeded social reforms by making a succession of adverse rulings—for example, a state law that sought to limit hours of bakers to ten hours per day was ruled unconstitutional. Neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party focused on the needs of workers, persons with low incomes, or oppressed groups such as African Americans, because voters in the Progressive Era tended to vote not on the basis of social class but according to local and family traditions that stemmed from ethnicity and sectionalism. (To the extent that workers and persons of low income voted at all, they split their votes between the two major parties, though African Americans usually voted for the Republican Party because of its historic role in ending slavery.) Because party leaders lacked an incentive to concentrate on assistance to those in need, social reformers often found it difficult to get their attention. * Reformers also had difficulty obtaining assistance from the groups that most needed social reforms—immigrants, workers, and African Americans. Language barriers, ethnic rivalries, and residential segregation impeded political cooperation among immigrant groups. Immigrants often distrusted middle-class reformers, who proposed civil service and other reforms that seemed irrelevant to their practical needs, and resented reforms to curb corruption in politics—including the political machines that represented the primary vehicle for distribution of jobs and food to immigrants. * Unions, which largely represented skilled crafts, were uncertain allies for social reformers. Samuel Gompers, the leader of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), attributed the demise of the Knights of Labor in the 1880s to its diversion to extraneous political and social issues and resolved, in consequence, to concentrate exclusively on union members’ wages and fringe benefits and on organizing skilled or semiskilled white, native, and male workers. His tactical defensiveness was increased, moreover, by repeated court injunctions that declared specific strikes to be illegal. Gompers’s tactical decisions helped the AFL make gains in the early years of this century but at the price of indifference to social reforms and abandonment of workers who were unskilled, female, immigrants, or people of color. Furthermore, the trade union movement remained weak. Employers mounted a decisive counterattack by means of lawsuits, bloody repression, spies, scabs, and red-baiting. The fledgling labor movement was fraught with internal dissension and outmoded organizing techniques. In the 19th century, skilled craftsmen who possessed considerable autonomy and worked within highly defined trades had dominated factories. But in the 20th century, factories were dominated by machinery, which relegated workers to tedious and unskilled work under the scrutiny of central management. Instead of organizing the workers of entire factories, unionists still tried to rally those groups of skilled workers within factories who performed specific tasks; this approach left many workers unorganized and led to turf rivalry between competing craft unions within specific factories. Gompers’s decision to avoid political partisanship also limited labor’s ability to develop political power and to obtain support for minimum wage and collective bargaining legislation. Labor’s noninvolvement in politics was illustrated in 1908, when the AFL raised only $8,000 for electoral campaigns! * Even had they tried, trade unionists would have found it difficult to organize and politically mobilize unskilled and semiskilled workers, who formed a massive constituency. Immigrants, who composed 60% of the industrial workforce in 1913, had extraordinary economic and social needs and were not likely to protest low wages, particularly when they knew that they could be easily replaced by other immigrants. African American workers, who constituted more than 10% of workers in Northern iron and steel plants, felt beholden to foremen who had hired them in an era of intense racial discrimination and were reluctant to make trouble. Female workers, who dominated the garment industry, often hoped to work only for a brief period before they married. The nation possessed, then, an enormous pool of relatively passive laborers who were susceptible to victimization and feared retribution from local courts and police forces if they supported strikes. * Gompers did not provide much assistance to social reformers. The AFL often opposed health insurance to workers on the grounds that it would undermine union efforts to obtain fringe benefits from employers. Many union leaders opposed the development of workmen’s compensation laws on the grounds that workers could obtain larger awards from court litigation. A powerful radical movement might have pressured politicians to redistribute resources to the working class, but its power was limited. The Socialist Party, which was established in 1901, managed to elect 56 socialist mayors, but its power resided mostly in local jurisdictions, and its elected officials were often indistinguishable from other progressive reformers. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was organized in 1905 and had 100,000 members by 1916, but it had little power in large industries; it represented only extremely poor workers in mining, lumbering, and agricultural sectors. (Most of its members lived in Western states.) As the Socialist candidate in the presidential election of 1912, Eugene Debs, a fiery labor leader, succeeded in obtaining nearly 1 million of the almost 15 million votes cast, but he was not a serious threat to the major political parties. * Social reformers were themselves impeded by their lack of interest in partisan politics during much of the Progressive Era. Many of them were contemptuous of existing parties, which they believed were corrupt and not interested in promoting reforms. Because many believed that their strength derived from the morality of their positions buttressed by public exposure of wrongdoing and social ills in the mass media, they envisioned social reform as a nonpartisan activity to pressure leaders of both parties to support reforms. Nonpartisanship allowed the progressives to maintain their political purity, but it prevented them from developing a partisan reform constituency. Their efforts to obtain support from politicians in both political parties meant that they controlled neither of them. Relatively conservative persons remained in control of the caucuses and conventions of the two major parties and often dictated their policies—under the influence of corporate interests, who remained the major source of campaign contributions for many political candidates. * In many cases, reformers’ energies were depleted by the task of continually raising funds to maintain staff for their nonpartisan organizations. Thousands of reform groups and settlements were formed in local, state, and national settings; these organizations often vied with one another for philanthropic contributions, and their leaders sometimes found that they had to tame their activities to retain the support of affluent donors. * Women and Children: Seizing the Opportunity If these various cultural and political obstacles impeded the enactment of benefit and service programs, how did progressives enact considerable legislation that benefited women and children? Curiously, the Supreme Court, while overruling laws that limited hours of work and minimum wages for men, allowed similar legislation for women, as in Muller v. Oregon (1908), which upheld an Oregon statute. Were not women, after all, particularly vulnerable and weak, and did not the nation depend upon their health to produce progeny? Given a legal loophole that did not extend to men, women were not timid in seizing the opportunity. Women’s organizations were remarkably numerous and well organized in the Progressive Era. Unlike European nations, which hardly allowed women to obtain higher education, nearly one-third of U.S. college students were women in 1900; that figure rose to one-half by 1920. Not allowed to enter the professions or many occupations—and otherwise limited to nursing and secondary school teaching—many of these well- educated women invested themselves in social reform activity; in many cases, they even decided to forgo marriage. Starting from local literary clubs, the General Federation of Women’s Clubs became a massive national organization, with local chapters that had over 1 million members in 1911. The U.S. Women’s Trade Union League sought to organize trade unions among female workers. The National Consumers League, headed by Florence Kelley, sought child labor laws and protectionist legislation for women. A network of more than 400 settlement houses organized grassroots pressure for various reforms. While focusing on prohibition, the Women’s Christian Temperance Union also supported a range of social legislation that would help women and children. The female leaders of these organizations, frequently in contact with one another, maintained pressure on politicians through petitions, lobbying, and publicity. They formed alliances with male-dominated interest groups in state capitals. They were remarkably adept, moreover, in using moral arguments with male legislators, by contending that reforms for women and children were needed to protect them from victimization by employers. * Even the tactical ingenuity of these dedicated women, however, proved insufficient to obtain unemployment insurance, old age pensions, or major federal legislation. Indeed, the focus on women’s and children’s legislation merely underscores the reluctance of Americans to address a range of social needs that exist in any industrialized and urbanized society. Evaluate Social Reformers and the Bull Moose Campaign of 1912 EP 5c During the first decade of the 20th century, both the Republican and Democratic parties were often dominated on specific issues by conservative politicians who insisted that federal authorities ought not to assume social welfare roles; who believed that social activists were “demagogues,” “socialists,” and “sentimental idealists”; and who sought to focus party platforms on international, tariff, currency, national defense, and related issues. Various conservatives supported specific pieces of social legislation —many of them, for example, favored the establishment of the Children’s Bureau—but they often opposed specific reforms. Each party contained an insurgent wing that favored social legislation and other reforms, but conservatives in party-nominating conventions and in legislative arenas often outmaneuvered its members. Corporate officials continued to assume a dominant role in American politics and often tried to persuade candidates from both parties to oppose reforms such as lower tariffs; it was not until 1914 that Woodrow Wilson was able to slash tariffs and thus reduce prices of many commodities for workers and immigrants. * Social reformers such as Jane Addams and Paul Kellogg experienced many policy successes in municipal and state arenas during the first decade of the 20th century as they secured passage of mothers’ pension, workmen’s compensation, and juvenile court legislation. They grew more confident as they became national celebrities. Many were frequently requested to give LO 5-7 speeches, some authored popular books, and Jane Addams was called an American reform goddess—even voted as the most popular American in a number of polls (see Insert 5.5 ). Insert 5.5. Proﬁles in Policy Advocacy: Jane Addams (1860–1935) Jane Addams—recognized around the world as a pioneer in the field of social work—is best remembered as the founder of Chicago’s Hull House project and the recipient of the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize. Born on September 6, 1860, in Cedarville, Illinois, Jane was the youngest of eight children born to Sarah (Weber) and John Huy Addams, a founding member of the Republican Party and an Illinois state senator from 1854 to 1870. Sarah Addams died before Jane’s fourth birthday. Senator Addams, a Hicksite Quaker and an abolitionist, became a dominant force in Jane’s life, influencing her ambitions and helping to shape her political views. He instilled in Jane an appreciation for the meaning and value of hard work and civic duty, which became evident once she launched her own career. Despite her physical ailment— tuberculosis of the spine—and the challenges presented by those who opposed her efforts to effect positive social policy, Jane Addams earned a place in history as a social reformer committed to peace and the improvement of the human condition. Shortly after her illness forced her to drop out of the Women’s Medical College in Philadelphia in 1881, Addams focused her career interests on mission work in general and the operation of settlement houses in particular. She discovered the need for this type of service in 1887 while visiting the Toynbee Hall project in London’s East End. The Toynbee Hall project was a pioneer effort aimed at providing young members of the clergy with exposure to the lives of the area’s urban poor. The project’s purpose was to teach these individuals how to provide better services to those in need. Jane Addams was so inspired by the Toynbee Hall project that she returned to the United States with a vision of replicating what she had witnessed in Europe. In September 1889, Addams, accompanied by her friend and confidante, Ellen Gates Starr, left the safety and comfort of her home in Cedarville and moved into the Charles J. Hull mansion, which later became known as Hull House. Hull House was located in a blighted neighborhood on South Halsted Street in Chicago. Like the Toynbee Hall project, Hull House had as its main objective introducing middle- class individuals to the life of the urban poor. Unlike the Toynbee Hall project, however, the majority of people who became involved in learning about and providing social services at Hull House were young, middle-class American women. At its peak operating capacity, Hull House had 13 buildings staffed by 65 persons, most of whom were college-educated professionals. Aside from providing much- needed community services, the Hull House served as a real-world training center for several well-known and respected social workers, including Edith and Grace Abbott, Alice Hamilton, Florence Kelly, Francis Hackett, Sophonisba Breckinridge, Jessie Binford, and Julia Lathrop. Due to the success of its programs and dedicated personnel, the Hull House project, under the supervision of Jane Addams, became widely recognized as a leader in the settlement house and social reform movement. By 1895, Jane Addams had taken her leadership skills and reform- oriented thinking from the successful Hull House project to Chicago’s City Hall. Her new objective: municipal reforms, aimed primarily at improving the working conditions faced by the city’s workers. She gained insight into the problems faced by the municipal workers during her brief stint as the inspector of streets and alleys for the Hull House district. Addams became a labor rights activist and participated in the Pullman strike of 1894, the building trades strike of 1900, the anthracite strike of 1902, the Chicago Stockyards strike of 1904, and the textile workers strike of 1910. With the advent of the Spanish-American War in 1898, Addams’s interest in world peace and the promotion of social justice everywhere was broadened. To share her personal views on pacifism and social ethics with others, Addams began delivering public lectures, including several held at the University of Chicago in 1899. She subsequently published her first book, Democracy and Social Ethics, which was released in 1902. In it, Addams called for both the reform of municipal politics and an end to war. By 1909, Jane Addams had achieved national recognition and was widely respected as a leader in the peace and social reform movement. That year, she became the first woman to head the National Conference of Charities and Correction. Three years later, she found herself campaigning for Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Party. Addams would soon discover, however, that, with the coming of World War I, large segments of the American public, including Roosevelt himself, would lose their taste for her reform efforts and turn against her. Addams’s involvement with the Women’s Peace Party, her protests while at the International Congress of Women at The Hague in 1915, and her affiliation with Henry Ford’s Peace Ship placed her in the crosshairs of intense criticism and rebuke from interventionists—those who saw war as the only solution to the European crisis. Addams’s critics went so far as to charge her with being a communist revolutionary and German sympathizer, despite her unwavering commitment to improving the lives of her fellow Americans. Her membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution was revoked. Even her service in the Department of Food Administration during the Hoover years was not enough to calm the attacks that had been launched against her. Undoubtedly, for several years before, during, and after World War I, Jane Addams’s faith and devotion to her ideals were challenged beyond the point at which most others would have conceded defeat. Jane Addams, however, did not surrender in the face of adversity. She continued to work at Hull House for more than 15 years after World War I, seeking a variety of reforms. Her life serves as a testimony to what can be accomplished through hard work and attention to civic duty. To many of her critics, the life of Jane Addams was wasted chasing Utopian ideals. What was true for many skeptics then is still true for many skeptics today: Social reform and improving the human condition occur only in pipe dreams. Yet a close analysis of Jane Addams’s accomplishments shows that her work produced very real results, as seen in the lives of many Americans. For her tireless devotion and commitment to advancing social justice, Jane Addams received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931, four years before her death in May 1935. Addams was deeply disappointed by the social and economic arrangements that existed in American society. She wanted, above all, to find a “higher ideal” of cooperativeness and collaboration to replace the competitiveness and self-seeking ambition that she saw around her in a society with extremes of inequality. In each of her books, Addams wrote of her hope that a specific group might lead the nation to a higher moral ground, whether immigrants, youth, or women. Immigrants, she believed, were imbued with a culture of cooperation that they had obtained in the villages and peasant life of the European and Russian societies from which they had emigrated. Youth possessed an innocence that might, if not ruined by acculturation to baser values around them, lead the nation in more altruistic directions. Women, she believed, were inculcated with a cooperative ethic in marked contrast to the values of men that were found in competitive corporate endeavors. She even hoped that most mothers would refuse to send their children to war due to their cooperative and life-sustaining ethic, only to find that most of them supported American involvement in World War I. It is not surprising, then, that Addams sought to create in Hull House a microcosm of the nation she hoped to create. It operated on three planes. On the one hand, it provided personal services and assistance to immigrants from many nations who had settled in Chicago, including language skills, cultural activities, and case advocacy to help immigrants obtain necessary legal documents and citizenship. Addams realized that immigrants needed help simply to survive in their new, complex, and often hostile environment. It also provided policy advocacy in the neighborhood and city surrounding Hull House, as well as in the state capital of Springfield. Addams sought regulations against child labor, regulation of factory conditions, housing codes, and myriad other specific reforms from a range of public officials. At one point, Hull House even backed a political candidate to run against the notorious Chicago machine, which was a corrupt group of politicians mostly interested in perpetuating their power through patronage and collection of bribes. She soon discovered, however, that electoral politics was a challenging arena as the machine candidate easily bested her favored candidate. Hull House also served as a focal point for national reform. Many progressive reformers actually stayed in Hull House for varying lengths of time, with Addams presiding over many forums and discussions among them about political strategy for sustaining a national reform movement. She worked closely with a dizzying array of reformers including Alice Paul (who sought many public health reforms) and Theodore Roosevelt. Addams’s conviction that progressives had to be active in politics led her to become a key leader in the Progressive Party when it selected Theodore Roosevelt to be its candidate in 1912 against what Addams believed were relatively conservative Democratic and Republican candidates. She was the first woman to give a keynote address at a national political convention— and she worked closely with Roosevelt to develop a political platform that envisioned expanding the progressive reform drive to the federal level to bring reforms such as unemployment insurance. As a pioneer founder of the social work profession, Addams toiled endlessly to imbue it with a policy advocacy mission rather than only providing services to clients. She reasoned that persons such as immigrants, caught in a web of hostile institutions and lack of social programs, could collectively progress only if Americans created a humane welfare state. Addams’s political involvement extended to international affairs. As a pacifist, but also because she feared it would blunt the progressive reform movement, she strongly opposed American involvement in World War I, which she viewed as a conflict between corrupt and colonialist regimes. She was vilified by many Americans for this position, since the American public overwhelmingly supported American involvement. Her conviction that the profession should make policy practice and advocacy central to its work was her legacy to the profession—and it is the reason that I dedicated my book ( Becoming an Effective Policy Advocate, now in its eighth edition) to her. However, frustration also made many of the reformers want larger policy victories. The prodigious effort to enact legislation in many states and municipalities took its toll. Why not, some asked, obtain sweeping national legislation to regulate the working conditions of women and children, establish upper limits on the hours of work, establish a progressive tax system, set a minimum wage, and extend the vote to women? A few avant- garde reformers even favored passage of national health insurance, unemployment insurance, and old age pensions. * Many social reformers dreamed that a fundamental political realignment might occur so that voters could choose between a relatively liberal party (with a constituency of intellectuals, workers, immigrants, and social reformers) and a relatively conservative party (with a constituency of business-people and affluent persons). It seemed that this dream of realignment might come to pass in the election of 1912. Theodore Roosevelt, who became president in 1901 after the assassination of William McKinley, had gingerly broached various reforms in his first term but had refrained from supporting many controversial reforms so as not to alienate the conservative wing of the Republican Party, whose support he needed if he was to obtain the party’s nomination in 1904. He became bolder during his second term, however; on the eve of leaving office, he left a lengthy reform agenda to Vice President William Taft, which he hoped Taft would support if elected in 1908. Roosevelt’s hopes in Taft were misplaced. Taft became a captive of the conservative wing of the Republican Party during his term in office from 1909 to 1912. A large, phlegmatic man, Taft believed that major social reforms were not needed. As Taft became more conservative, the charismatic and energetic Roosevelt became more liberal. Dashing to and from his wild game safaris in Africa, he added support of national child labor legislation, a progressive income tax, and workmen’s compensation to his reform agenda. He proposed the creation of an industrial commission to conduct national economic planning, which would be charged with fostering economic growth and regulating trusts so that their power and job creation potential could be realized. Feminists persuaded him to support a constitutional amendment to give women the vote. Taft feared that Roosevelt, backed by social reformers, would try to regain control of the Republican Party by seeking its presidential nomination in 1912. Many reformers had maintained a nonpartisan stance prior to 1912 and had supported neither of the two major parties, but a number of them, including Jane Addams and Paul Kellogg, openly advocated supporting Roosevelt for the nomination. The stage was set for a confrontation at the Republican convention in Chicago in the summer of 1912. However, the hopes of social reformers were dashed when Taft and entrenched party leaders secured the nomination for Taft in a series of power moves. They were further disheartened when the Democratic Party nominated Woodrow Wilson, the governor of New Jersey and former college president, who favored states’ rights and focused on trust-busting and lowering tariffs. Instead of realignment, both parties seemed to be following a conservative course. Many social reformers believed that realignment might still occur if a new political party was established with Roosevelt as its leader. With lightning speed, reformers called a convention of the Progressive Party in Chicago and persuaded a reluctant Roosevelt to accept its presidential nomination. The new party and its nominee were hardly rabid social reformers—only 25% of its platform, as well as of his acceptance speech, was devoted to social reforms—but they were far more reformist than alternative parties and candidates. Their platform included support for social insurances, workmen’s compensation, a minimum wage, women’s suffrage, and a child labor law. Jane Addams became the first woman to address a major political convention when she seconded the nomination of Roosevelt. Party members entered the campaign in an atmosphere of religious and moral fervor, but many practical problems bedeviled them. They had to secure a place on the ballot in the various states, obtain campaign funds, and develop a massive constituency in a nation that was wedded to the Democratic and Republican parties. Roosevelt doubted that he could prevail in the election of 1912, but he and others hoped they could educate the public sufficiently that workers and liberals would support the Progressive Party and that it would replace the Republican Party. * Wilson, who had supported some progressive reforms as governor of New Jersey, tried from the outset to portray Taft as an extremist on the right and Roosevelt as an extremist on the left. He persuaded Samuel Gompers and many other union leaders to support him, by promising them that he would seek legislation to improve the legal status of organized labor. When he was portrayed as a left-winger by both Wilson and Taft, Roosevelt counterattacked vigorously by arguing that Taft and Wilson held outmoded and conservative ideas. He succeeded in differentiating his positions from those of Wilson by questioning Wilson’s assertions that a minimum wage would depress prices, by arguing that a welfare state was needed in an industrial society, and by insisting that states’ rights had to be superseded by national planning. He drew enormous and enthusiastic crowds at his campaign appearances. When the results were tallied, Roosevelt made a respectable showing but lost the election because ethnic and regional loyalties, as well as the allegiance of many immigrants to political bosses, led many Democratic voters to support Wilson. Wilson won, not because he was overwhelmingly popular—he received less than 50% of the popular vote—but because the Republican vote was split between Taft and Roosevelt. * Many persons who had voted for Roosevelt still believed that political realignment was possible if the Progressive Party could be kept intact and if it waged successful campaigns in the congressional elections of 1914 and the presidential election of 1916. The reformers hoped that Roosevelt would win in 1916, that the Republican Party would die, and that conservatives would gravitate to the Democratic Party. To ensure that the Progressive Party maintained its reforming mission, social reformers succeeded in creating a national department of the party, directed by Jane Addams, that focused on social research and the development of social policies. Promisingly, 20 members of Congress declared their allegiance to the party, as did a number of local officeholders. Practical realities doomed the reformers’ dreams of political realignment to failure, however. Political experts decided that party funds should be devoted to hiring political experts and financing campaigns, and so, to the dismay of reformers, the social service department of the party was terminated. The party was unable to raise the funds necessary to get on the ballot in some jurisdictions. Most damaging to the Progressive Party, however, was Woodrow Wilson’s unexpected support for social legislation during his presidency. Although he had argued in the campaign of 1912 that federal authorities should not enact a minimum wage or place restrictions on child labor and had lambasted the idea of a welfare state as paternalistic, he realized in the aftermath of his victory that he could significantly add to the political base of the Democratic Party if he adopted some of the reforms proposed by the Progressive Party. He even cautiously wooed social reformers like Jane Addams. He enacted child labor legislation, banking legislation, tariff reductions, and eventually women’s suffrage. * The fate of the Progressive Party was virtually sealed by its poor showing in the congressional elections of 1914. Except in a few scattered locations, the party was defunct well before the presidential election of 1916. Roosevelt tried to secure the Republican nomination in 1916 but was again rebuffed by party conservatives, who nominated Charles Hughes. Wilson again ran successfully on the Democratic ticket, with the assistance of many progressive reformers. The failure of the Progressive Party during and after 1912 demonstrated that social reform could not proceed beyond the limited policy successes of the Progressive Era unless reformers could obtain a power base by capturing a major party that had significant support from liberals, the working class, and people of color. The demise of the Progressive Party also illustrated the precarious position of social reform in America, despite growing social problems in the cities. It would take a catastrophic depression in the late 1920s to galvanize workers, the poor, and people of color behind social reforms—and it would be a distant cousin of Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who would finally accomplish the political realignment that the progressives had sought. Recognize the Oppression of V ulnerable Populations or Outgroups in the Progressive Era EP 3a EP 3b It would be a mistake to view progressivism as a reform movement fought for, by, and on behalf of the immigrants who constituted such major portions of the nation’s urban population. Americans of this era harbored very contradictory opinions about this huge population; though they freely used—and depended on—immigrants as cheap labor to fuel industrial growth, they resented, and sometimes even feared, this population for reasons of eugenics (would intermarriage dilute the Anglo-Saxon race?), social unrest (could America have a revolution if “agitators” awoke these immigrants, and did the big-city political machines constitute a threat to democracy?), public health (did the immigrants pass diseases, such as tuberculosis, to others?), and culture (did Catholicism, Judaism, and ethnic cultures threaten Protestant values and American culture?). Nor were the progressives, aside from many settlement workers and certain other reformers, free from racism; indeed, no significant civil rights legislation was enacted or seriously considered in this period, and some decided setbacks occurred. Although women were often in the vanguard of social reform in the Progressive Era and made some economic and other gains (e.g., regulation of their working conditions and hours), they remained shackled by traditional notions of their role in society. LO 5-8 The Oppression of W omen As we discussed in Chapter 4 , women’s suffrage became the central reform issue of the women’s movement with the formation of the National American Women’s Suffrage Association in 1890. Between 1890 and 1905, women presented many petitions requesting state legislatures to modify their constitutions so as to grant women the vote, but they had scant success. Even many women regarded the issue as tangential to their economic and social needs. The male and female leaders of antisuffrage organizations contended that female voters would destroy the unity of households by voting for their own interests and would fall prey to demagogues because of their “hysterical” tendencies. Moreover, the liquor interests strongly opposed suffrage on the grounds that women would support temperance. More progress was made after 1905 because feminist leaders had developed sophisticated organizing skills and because women’s prominent roles in the Progressive Era made the issue seem less radical. Indeed, 12 states had granted women the vote by 1916. Instead of emphasizing feminist arguments, suffragettes argued that female voters would support progressive reforms on education and family issues—an argument that was received favorably by males imbued with the 19th-century belief that women’s superior moral qualities and temperament made them best suited to attend to family matters and children. (See Figure 5.3 .) Immigrant husbands increasingly supported suffrage for women, who were providing a major source of labor for the garment industry. Militant suffragists, who used disruptive organizing tactics, alienated some voters but dramatized the issue. A dramatic breakthrough occurred during World War I, when Woodrow Wilson finally agreed to support the issue, after such leaders as Carrie Chapman Catt threatened to target Democratic candidates for defeat and argued that suffrage was needed to maintain national unity during the war. The Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution was finally enacted in 1920. * Figure 5.3. Details UPI/Time & Life Pictures/Getty Images Women representing three states at a march of 25,000 advocates for suffrage. Although suffrage got the most attention, other developments were of equal importance to women. There were major increases in female employment in industrial settings, as well as clerical, stenographic, and sales positions. (These occupations, as well as teaching, social work, and nursing, were gender-segregated and poorly paid, however.) Moreover, there was a sizable increase in the number of married women who worked; whereas only 14% of all women workers were married in 1900, more than 24% were married in 1910. But economic gains ought not to be overstated. Protective labor laws were developed to “protect” women from exertion that could endanger their reproductive functions or expose them to excessive mixing with men, who might debase them morally and sexually. Abramovitz argues that these laws served to preserve “a sex-segregated labor market, the relative subordination of women to men, and the overall marginalization of women workers.” Women were rarely unionized and represented a relatively docile labor force, although there were some dramatic strikes in the garment industry, such as the 1909 shirtwaist strike, in which tens of thousands of women in New York City and Philadelphia protested unsafe working conditions and low wages. If 20% of men were union members according to a national survey of 15 occupations in 1905, only 3% of women belonged to unions. Mothers’ pension laws, which might have been fashioned to provide major resources to single heads of households—or to help them obtain child care so that they could continue to work—were primarily developed with the needs of children in mind. As in prior eras, it was assumed that women with children ought not to work, and so the pensions were devised to provide just enough money so that mothers could stay at home. Little organized day care existed for working women in this period. * Moreover, obstacles to women’s sexual freedom persisted. The repertoire of birth control techniques had expanded to include condoms and diaphragms, but women learned of these techniques only by word of mouth and through vaguely worded advertisements, rather than at public family-planning clinics; even physicians often opposed their use on the grounds that they interfered with the natural reproductive functions of women or reduced the growth of the white population. Moreover, the obscenity laws of most states prohibited public discussion of these techniques or the distribution of birth control devices. As we noted in Chapter 4 , the Comstock Law, enacted in 1873, outlawed the distribution of birth control information through the federal mails. Margaret Sanger founded a birth control movement, but its leaders were frequently jailed under obscenity laws. Realizing the futility of trying to change obscenity laws, Sanger focused increasingly on persuading physicians to prescribe birth control, because they could legally do so when medical needs existed. Her efforts gradually gained support in the medical profession, which often prescribed birth control by the late 1920s. Most low-income persons lacked personal physicians, however, and did not have access to birth control because public birth control clinics were still outlawed in many jurisdictions. * During this period, women were subjected to medical practices that contemporary Americans can scarcely fathom. Assuming that women’s reproductive systems were the cause of many of their physical ailments, physicians performed large numbers of hysterectomies. Indeed, some physicians assumed that women’s normal state was to be sick. Menstruation, menopause, and childbirth were viewed as essentially medical conditions that required endless medications and surgeries. As “delicate” people, women had to be shielded, moreover, from those occupations that required physical (or even mental) exertion. Women were also commonly believed to be subject to bouts of hysteria—a condition that required bed rest in darkened rooms for weeks or even months at a time, on the theory that the absence of stimuli would allow them to recover. * By 1930, little progress had been made in dispelling the cult of domesticity for married women, which had originated a century earlier. It consigned women to childbearing and domestic duties, while precluding them from entering the professions or business. Women were endlessly exhorted to use materials from child psychology and home economics in perfecting the science of homemaking and to refrain from careers or other employment. Men objected if eminent women were nominated to serve on commissions or in administrative positions, even within the emerging social work profession. Moreover, women’s access to law, medicine, and business, which had increased in the Progressive Era, eroded in subsequent decades. Many women were midwives at the turn of the century—a respected profession—but male physicians increasingly supplanted them by defining childbirth narrowly as a medical condition that required licensed (male) physicians. (By contrast, most babies were and are delivered by midwives in many European nations.) * The Oppression of African Americans The civil rights gains of freed slaves were nullified following the Civil War; Southern whites regained their political power when Northerners withdrew military and legislative pressure on the South and when the Supreme Court rendered federal civil rights laws useless. Republicans hoped to regain their Southern constituency, but Democrats had become the dominant party of the South by 1900 and staunchly resisted federal efforts to protect or help African Americans. Most African Americans lived in rural areas as tenant farmers; low wages and indebtedness to plantation owners enmeshed them in grinding poverty. Increasing numbers moved to Southern cities where, aside from a small elite group of affluent African Americans, they were unemployed or worked as domestic servants or in other low-paying and unskilled jobs. Rich or poor, they all lived within a segregated society. Americans had developed, in effect, a social system that approached apartheid and was maintained by Jim Crow laws, police, courts, and white racism. * The situation was more favorable for African Americans in the North, but only modestly so. Poverty and lack of jobs in the South led to a steady and growing migration of African Americans to Northern cities, where their presence was still relatively small in 1915. The enticement of jobs in burgeoning industries like meatpacking and steel drew African Americans to the North, where their wages, though low, were nonetheless considerably higher than what they could earn in the South. Neighborhoods occupied by African Americans were even more blighted than those occupied by other immigrant groups, were more likely to be the headquarters of organized crime and drug interests, and had virtually no health or other services. African Americans experienced extraordinary discrimination in job markets; they were excluded from skilled trades and unions, were often used as scabs to break unions, and were subject to race riots and mob violence when they competed with whites for jobs. Most African Americans in the North, like their urban counterparts in the South, worked in unskilled jobs. * African Americans in both the North and the South evolved ingenious strategies for coping with adversity and for seeking social reforms. African American women assumed even more assertive roles than white women in promoting self-help and charitable projects. They developed mutual benefit societies that provided insurance for sickness and funerals. They participated in church groups such as the Women’s Convention of the Black Baptist Church, which had 1.5 million members in 1907. They formed Women’s Clubs to promote charities, such as the National Association of Colored Women. They formed their own settlement houses, and they established 200 hospitals and nurse-training schools. Unlike white women, African American women placed particular emphasis on education; they regarded schools—from kindergarten to college—as a kind of antipoverty program. In the South, educational needs were extreme. Because local jurisdictions underfunded public schools for African Americans, private support had to be found. Even as late as 1940, only 1% of African Americans, male and female, had four or more years of college; and many Southern colleges for African Americans were only the equivalent of secondary schools. * In the broader African American community, a conflict between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois reflected the dilemma of oppressed people. Washington, the son of a slave woman and her white master, preached accommodation; he wanted African Americans to conquer racism through honesty, hard work, and the help of kindly patrons. But Du Bois wanted African Americans to develop political power so that they could obtain civil rights laws and get access to the same educational advantages as whites. Du Bois and other African American leaders formed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909 and succeeded in getting 6,000 members by 1914, mostly from the African American middle class. The Oppression of Asian Immigrants Asian immigrants on the West Coast also suffered discrimination and poverty. As we noted in Chapter 4 , hundreds of Chinese immigrants came to California in the late 19th century to work on the railroads and in the mines and were followed by Japanese immigrants over the next two decades. Many Americans viewed Asians as sinister and untrustworthy people and worried that they brought diseases to America; editorialists wrote hatefully of the “yellow peril.” To survive, many Japanese Americans capitalized on their ability to farm hillside land, and both Chinese and Japanese immigrants developed specialized niches in urban America; they ran laundries and small businesses. However, both groups frequently encountered prejudice and adverse policies. California enacted Alien Land Laws in 1913 and 1920 to prohibit land purchases and ownership by Japanese residents. Even in this period, long before World War II, many people feared that the Japanese would overrun the West Coast and even attack the United States. Many Americans urged extension of the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to the Japanese but had to content themselves with measures such as the Gentleman’s Agreement of 1907, in which Japan agreed to stop the migration of laborers to the United States. (For diplomatic reasons, Roosevelt did not want to antagonize the Japanese government by legally prohibiting Japanese immigration. * ) In both Hawaii and California, the Japanese immigrants fashioned an ingenious survival strategy. Taking advantage of a shortage of craftspeople and artisans and also of entrepreneurs, the Japanese quickly filled these economic positions. In Hawaii, their access to supplies from Japan and the difficulty of obtaining supplies from the United States, because of the distances involved, allowed them to develop a monopoly of retail grocery and dry goods stores. In California, bringing skills in hillside and irrigated farming from Japan, they leased or owned substantial acreage and were able to monopolize the burgeoning fresh vegetable crops. As in Hawaii, Japanese Americans were adept at becoming entrepreneurs; by 1919, they owned 45% of the hotels and 25% of the grocery stores in Seattle. Both Chinese and Japanese Americans achieved these stunning successes by pooling funds in their own communities to allow one another to invest and thus sidestepping the restrictive lending policies of commercial banks. Far weaker on the West Coast, unions did not systematically prevent Asian Americans from entering the trades, unlike unions in the East and Midwest that denied entry to African Americans. * The Oppression of Spanish-Speaking Persons In the Southwest lived large numbers of Latinos whose land had been taken from them in the mid and late 19th century. Mexican immigrants, who were able to move freely across a relatively unrestricted border until 1924, when the U.S. Border Patrol was created, swelled their numbers. It is impossible to know precisely how many Latinos came across the 2,000-mile border, but some scholars estimate roughly 195,000 migrated between 1900 and 1920; their numbers grew dramatically in the wake of the economic dislocation accompanying the Mexican revolution of 1910. By 1930, the U.S. population included more than 2 million people who had been born in Mexico. These immigrants, as well as the indigenous Latino population, became the labor force for the irrigated cotton, vegetable, and fruit enterprises of the Southwest. Along with ranching and meat processing, these enterprises expanded enormously after the Reclamation Act of 1902 provided large federal funding for irrigation projects. Latinos worked not only in the fields but in numerous canning and food-processing plants. They lived in barracks in remote rural areas and were subject to the punitive labor policies of large landowners, who paid low wages and brutally suppressed protest. Like many rural African Americans in the South, they were denied education and excluded from economic opportunities that developed in urban America. Nor were conditions much better for those Latinos who settled in growing urban areas of the Southwest, where employers used them as a reserve labor force to break strikes and depress wages. Those few business ventures that were owned by Latinos were located in Spanish-speaking communities and were mostly small stores. * As a strictly regional population in the Southwest (only 15% lived outside the Southwest even as late as 1930), Latinos were isolated politically and subject to local and regional groups, such as growers, who wished to subjugate them. The Mexican government frequently protested the working conditions and suppression of the Latino population to the U.S. State Department, but to no avail. * These Spanish-speaking persons in the Southwest differed markedly from European immigrants—and from African Americans. Like African Americans, they met the labor needs of white landowners, who could tap an inexhaustible supply of workers who migrated back and forth across the border. Indeed, in the wake of the Mexican Revolution, about 10% of the population of Mexico had emigrated to the United States; most were “unofficial immigrants,” who evaded various fees, visas, and (after 1917) literacy tests. Also like African Americans, they could not easily enter the economic mainstream because they had limited access to schools, lived in areas where industrialization had hardly emerged, and lacked capital or the capital-raising techniques used by Asian immigrants. * Unlike African Americans, however, these Spanish-speaking people had not been forcibly taken from their homeland or placed in bondage. Moving back and forth frequently between Mexico and the United States, they developed a “sojourner mentality”—a belief that they would soon return to Mexico. However, this mentality impeded their development of economic roots—for example, by preventing them from buying homes—it allowed them to retain their culture, with its emphasis on Catholicism, families, communities, and mutual assistance. Communities organized mutualistas, or mutual aid funds, to provide insurance, funeral, and limited welfare benefits. They observed Mexican holidays and traditions. This vibrant culture allowed Latinos to maintain their equilibrium even when they confronted oppressive conditions and grinding poverty. * As a sojourner group that served the economic needs of white agricultural entrepreneurs, Spanish-speaking people of the Southwest would be linked in ensuing decades to immigration policy. Growers, who craved cheap labor, wanted no limits on immigration or else lax enforcement. They counted on ineffective border patrols and often sought exclusions for Latinos when restrictionist immigration policy was passed at the national level. For example, they had Western hemisphere people exempted from restrictive quotas in the National Origins Act of 1924 (though Asian immigration was eliminated altogether). Growers also sought to define a special class of immigrants, known as braceros, who would be allowed to enter the nation only for specific harvests or brief periods; this program was first initiated in 1917, when almost 80,000 workers were admitted. With a relatively open border in the 1920s, many Mexican immigrants came to the United States. Considerable prejudice against Latinos in the broader population, however, led to strident efforts to restrict the flow of migration in the 1930s and subsequent decades, as illustrated by the 1994 passage of California’s Proposition 187—a measure that proposed to bolster border patrols and deny “illegal” Latinos educational, health, and other benefits. * Understand the Alliance of Progressivism and Racism EP 3a Many progressive reformers saw no contradiction between social reform and racism, as the actions of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson demonstrate. Roosevelt raised storms of protest when he invited Booker T. Washington, the African American leader, to the White House for lunch during his first term. Although Washington, unlike Marcus Garvey, was no militant and favored accommodation to existing policies, this luncheon led Roosevelt’s foes to portray him as a radical on racial issues; even as late as 1912, the luncheon was cited as evidence that Roosevelt was a “nigger lover.” Roosevelt was hardly a defender of civil rights, however. After the luncheon with Washington, he refrained from all public meetings with African Americans. He took no actions against Jim Crow legislation in the South, sided with white authorities in the infamous Brownsville incident in 1906 (in which African American soldiers were executed on undocumented charges that they had raped white women), and did not contest lily-white delegations to Republican conventions from Southern districts. Jane Addams vainly protested Roosevelt’s acceptance of white Southern delegations to the convention of the ostensibly reformist Progressive Party in 1912. Like most white Americans in this era, Roosevelt upheld a racial ideology that extolled the virtues of the Anglo American race to the detriment of other races, including African Americans, Asians, Latinos, and Native LO 5-9 Americans. The racial doctrines that had fueled manifest destiny, which we discussed in Chapter 4 , lived on in many white Americans, who believed that the superiority of Anglo Americans was proven by scientific evidence (later discredited) such as alleged differences in skull size and intelligence. Roosevelt’s ideological orientation and his desire to obtain white Southerners’ support for the Republican Party led him to neglect the problems of African Americans and other people of color. * Woodrow Wilson was even less sympathetic than Roosevelt to the needs of African Americans. Raised in the South, he had adopted the racial orientations of affluent Southerners. Moreover, he was the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party, which had relied on race baiting throughout the late 19th century to secure the support of Southern whites. If Roosevelt had given African Americans some token posts in government, Wilson refused even to give the ambassadorship to Liberia to an African American, openly supported segregated rest-room facilities in federal departments, and condoned lynching in the South. So detestable were his policies to African Americans that most of them continued to vote Republican, even though many social reformers switched their allegiance from the defunct Progressive Party to Wilson in 1916. * The courts reinforced prevailing attitudes. In the infamous ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the U.S. Supreme Court condoned a Southern state’s law that mandated that African Americans travel on separate railway cars from Caucasians—a ruling in marked contradiction to civil rights legislation passed by the Congress in the wake of the Civil War. Even before this ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court had upheld rulings of other courts that federal civil rights legislation of the Reconstruction era applied only to the discriminatory acts of individuals rather than to the laws of state and local governments. * These rulings dealt a death blow to civil rights in the United States because they upheld the legality of Jim Crow legislation (discussed in Chapter 4 ) that required African Americans to use separate restrooms and rooms in restaurants and other public places, that consigned them to separate areas of trains and buses, and that imposed literacy tests and other devices to stop them from voting. Save for the actual institution of slavery that had been prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the South had virtually returned to the same policies that had brought the nation into the Civil War about 40 years earlier. Many progressive leaders, including Presidents Roosevelt and Wilson, failed to speak out against these unethical court rulings that would take about 60 years to be rescinded with the Civil Rights Acts of 1954 and 1965. Jane Addams and a small band of social reformers were exceptions to the alliance of progressivism and racism. She supported the establishment of settlement houses in African American communities, sought to improve schools, and urged better protection of African Americans from lynching and race riots. She argued that African Americans possessed qualities of altruism and gentleness that made them superior in some respects to the dominant population. Her beliefs were not shared, however, by most policy makers in the North or South or by most Americans. * Analyze the Imposition of a Racist Policy of Immigration EP 3b We have discussed the torrent of immigration to the United States from European nations in the period from 1880 to 1920. With the frontier closed, immigrants concentrated in major cities and became a low-paid labor force for the industrial system of the United States. Deliberating in a nation already dominated by immigrants, the founding fathers finally decided to make no mention of immigration in the Constitution and to allow Congress to shape the relevant policy. In the succeeding years, Americans adopted an extraordinarily liberal policy for white immigrants; they applied no annual limits, required no literacy test, and allowed people to naturalize within five years. No one anticipated, however, that immigrants would arrive in such numbers in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century—or that many of them would not be Protestants. As Higham suggests, Americans have oscillated between periods of confidence, when they believed the nation could absorb immigrants without threat to their culture or economy, and periods of fear, when they believed the nation could be endangered by the immigrants’ religions and culture; when they feared immigrants would take their jobs; and when they feared that immigrant anarchists or radicals would bring social unrest. We have already discussed nativism during the Irish immigration of the 19th century. However, confidence reigned supreme in the first decade of the 20th century, when many Americans believed that the LO 5-10 nation could socialize and convert immigrants to American culture. Moreover, immigrant groups, such as the German-American Alliance, Irish groups, and Jewish groups, developed considerable political power; they fought efforts to limit immigration by threatening not to vote for candidates who supported restrictive immigration policies. * Even during this period of confidence, however, groups such as the Immigration Restriction League devised ways of limiting immigration—for example, by imposing literacy tests. The racist ideas associated with the doctrine of manifest destiny in the 19th century—for example, the fierce concern to prevent the “dilution” of Anglo-Saxon stock through intermarriage—began to resurface with the continuing influx of immigrants, who averaged 650,000 per year between 1907 and 1917. (Immigrants of non-Caucasian races, such as Asians, were perceived as a particular threat.) * Anti-Catholicism, always present, began to reemerge. The rise of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a radical labor group, was linked by many people to “foreign agitators.” A sharp economic downturn during and after 1913 led to a growing sense that immigrants threatened local jobs. And the immigrants of this era, like the Irish before the Civil War, were widely believed to bring with them diseases; a popular book of the era stated: The new immigration contained a large and increasing number of the weak, the broken, and the mentally crippled of all races drawn from the lowest stratum of the Mediterranean basin and the Balkans, together with hordes of the wretched, submerged populations of the Polish ghettoes. Our jails, insane asylums, and almshouses are filled with human flotsam and the whole tone of American life, social, moral, and political, has been lowered and vulgarized by them. * Those seeking to restrict immigration found that their power increased steadily in the years preceding World War I. One victory was to enact a literacy test for immigrants who wished to become citizens in the Immigration Act of 1917. However, a curious combination of industrialists (who wanted immigrant labor) and friends of immigrants (such as the National Liberal Immigration League) held off restrictionist legislation; President Wilson vetoed legislation enacted by Congress in 1914. World War I and its aftermath vastly increased fear of foreigners; Americans were angered by various European powers and alarmed by the Russian Revolution. A “crusade for Americanization” developed during and after the war to make foreigners speak English and to identify and prosecute “bolsheviks” in a red scare that led to the imprisonment of many foreigners. After passage of a series of lesser measures, the Immigration Act of 1924 not only limited overall rates of immigration but also gave preference, within the diminished flow, to people from Northern Europe; it accomplished this by the ingenious device of limiting immigration to 2% of the population of the corresponding nationality in the United States in 1890, when relatively few Japanese, Italians, Eastern Europeans, or Russian Jews had arrived. Thus restricted, Italian immigration dropped from 42,000 to 4,000 persons per year and Japanese immigration to 40 per year. Only Mexican immigrants escaped the restrictions, probably because their regional isolation in the Southwest made them less frightening to nativists and because agricultural, food-processing, and railroad interests in the region wanted to exploit them as cheap labor. * Discuss the Resilience of Jane Addams and Her Allies EP 2a Progressive reformers such as Jane Addams tried to develop social reforms in a society where individualism and competitiveness blinded its citizens to social problems. Unlike European reformers, who received support from trade unions, American reformers had to raise funds from the wealthy to establish organizations for social reform. There were few social welfare precedents, aside from local poorhouses and charities. Reformers had to obtain statistics about the incidence of various social problems, educate the public, fashion legislative testimony, engage in lobbying, network with reformers in other jurisdictions, and build coalitions. Despite their national popularity, they encountered extraordinary hostility from corporations, political machines, affluent citizens, conservatives, and even groups they sought to help, such as trade unions and immigrants. When Addams courageously attacked U.S. involvement in World War I, she was reviled as a traitor, even by many of her fellow reformers. The persistence of the reformers was striking. Many began their work in the 1890s and continued to seek reforms until the United States entered World War I in 1917. During and after the war, when the nation turned toward conservatism, many collapsed from exhaustion, left the country, converted to conservatism, or turned to psychotherapy, which was in vogue in the 1920s. Some reformers bucked the conservative trend even during the 1920s, however. Addams continued to reside in Hull House, sought many LO 5-11 new reforms, and correctly predicted that the United States would need to address the needs of the expanding African American population in Northern cities.Understand the Emergence of Social W ork EP 5b An important question had to be answered during the Progressive Era: Who was to staff those social agencies that helped immigrants, poor people, children who could not remain with their natural families, and so many other troubled individuals? By 1920, a new profession, called social work, had developed schools in which people were trained to give these kinds of services. The development of social work was marked by considerable tension between different factions, each of which left an imprint on the profession; these complex origins foreshadowed much controversy about the direction of social work during the remainder of the 20th century. In particular, there was a striking difference in approach between those who came from settlement houses and those intent on developing a methodology for helping people in one-on-one transactions. Recall from Chapter 4 that, even as early as the 1840s, various agencies in Eastern cities undertook to systematize relief-giving to people in poverty by using volunteers to interview them, determine whether they were truly needy, and supervise them while they received assistance, with an eye to making them independent as soon as possible. In some cases, agencies compared their records so as to be certain that people were not receiving assistance from more than one source. In the decades after the Civil War, these early attempts to turn relief giving into a disciplined process were enlarged in many jurisdictions. Local, nongovernment agencies—called charity organization societies (COSs)— LO 5-12 developed in most cities to provide assistance to destitute people. Initially, these agencies did not actually give relief to individuals; instead, they sought to coordinate relief giving, with an eye to preventing people from seeking simultaneous assistance from two or more agencies. The agencies were administered by a paid male who recruited and supervised female volunteers—usually relatively affluent, white, English-speaking women; these women who came to be known as friendly visitors were supposed to provide moral uplift to impoverished people. Some COS agencies eventually came to give out relief themselves, thereby joining the various sectarian agencies that had long provided aid to destitute persons. To coordinate and systematize their growing operations, private relief-giving agencies began to hire staff, usually women who remained in non- administrative posts. Relief giving by private agencies in the latter part of the 19th century was a grim undertaking. Friendly visitors and paid staff were taught to engage in a careful diagnostic and supervising process, as they screened, aided, and finally discharged poor people who needed assistance. Above all, they were to avoid giving indiscriminately or letting their emotions dictate their actions. Indeed, it was their duty to turn away, or refer to poorhouses, those people who were not bent on achieving independence and moral improvement; these qualities were monitored both at point of intake and throughout the helping process. The friendly visitors did detailed research on the motivations, history, and living arrangements of families as they decided whether and how to help destitute people. Moreover, they were to provide instruction to their wards, both through teaching (such as how to keep a clean house and prepare decent meals) and through personal example. As models of hard work, thrift, and morality, they could, it was hoped, inculcate those virtues in their clients. These friendly visitors probably exhibited contradictory tendencies in their work—both punitive attitudes and a desire to help. In screening “undeserving” from “deserving” poor people, they were certainly punitive. As white, English-speaking people, their immigrant wards perceived them most likely as condescending and/or harsh. They were often unaware that the poverty of the immigrants stemmed not from faults of character, such as laziness, but from the lack of available work or discrimination in hiring. Yet they could be advocates for their wards with local police, educational, and other agencies and provided hands-on assistance by actually visiting the homes and neighborhoods of their clients. Some leaders of the charity societies formed quasi-public organizations at the state level to inspect state mental institutions, to collect data about pauperism and other social problems, and to combat patronage and corruption in public institutions. A national organization, the National Conference of Charities, was established in 1879 after members of various state boards of charities, who had been meeting annually in the American Social Science Association, decided that they needed their own organization; it convened annual conferences of leaders in this emerging field. (In 1884, it changed its name to the National Conference of Charities and Corrections.) Admission was also open to people engaged in private, nongovernment charity in local agencies, who soon dominated the organization. * The paid staff who supplanted volunteers in the last decades of the 19th century were the forerunners of the social work profession; they articulated a helping methodology called casework, which explained the techniques charity workers should use when helping individual clients. We can now contrast the charity organization societies with people who administered and worked in settlement houses. These two factions were quite different, even though they both attended the annual meetings of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections. Settlement staff tended to be somewhat more reform-oriented, more inclined to decrease the personal distance between paid staff and neighborhood residents, and less convinced that helping could be reduced to a science. These differences sparked frequent conflict between the two groups. For example, during the Progressive Era, many charity organization leaders opposed the development of mothers’ pensions, which, they argued, represented an unwarranted intrusion into the work of nongovernment agencies. By contrast, Jane Addams and many other social workers who were identified with social reform militantly supported mothers’ pensions. (Even as late as 1932, some social workers believed that private agencies could manage the economic destitution that accompanied the Great Depression, which began in 1929. * ) How was a profession to be molded from these two disparate factions? Both charity workers and settlement staff realized that extended training was necessary if they were to develop a profession—and training had mostly taken the form of practical experience on the job, brief seminars, or courses in sociology, which had begun to be taught in universities in the 1890s. Wenocur and Reisch contend that the charity organization movement seized the initiative, with the assistance of the Russell Sage Foundation. * Mary Richmond, who was a noteworthy theorist in the methodology of investigating and assisting individuals and had worked extensively with the Baltimore Charity Organization Society, had long espoused the development of a training school to be affiliated with a university. Her fledgling efforts, such as a 6-week summer program of the New York Charity Organization Society in 1898, whetted appetites for more ambitious projects. The training period was extended to one year and then, with the establishment of the New York School of Philanthropy in 1910, to two years. (This program later became the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work.) In quick succession, other schools were established in Boston and at institutions of higher education, including Bryn Mawr, Ohio State, Indiana University, and the University of Minnesota. Casework became the dominant curriculum focus of these various schools, although smatterings of other subject matter were included. In 1907, settlement leaders in Chicago founded the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, which later became the School of Social Service Administration of the University of Chicago. However, its existence did not fundamentally challenge the dominance of those who saw the profession essentially as an extension of the charity societies’ work. The emerging casework, as articulated by Richmond in her classic book Social Diagnosis, lacked the punitive qualities of much of the charity societies’ work and was geared toward helping individuals with personal problems rather than toward determining whether they “deserved” monetary assistance, but it still focused on one-on-one transactions. * The founders of the Chicago School worried that the emphasis on casework, so entrenched in many of the early schools, would prove to be an excessively narrow focus for the new profession. Wenocur and Reisch contend that the leaders in this early movement to develop a profession were constrained by economic realities. The budding profession depended, after all, on affluent philanthropists and university elites to provide resources and institutional support for the new training programs and agency services. From this vantage, the emphasis on personal casework was an ideal choice, for it was far less controversial than the social reform practiced by some settlements. Moreover, it seemed scientific in its emphasis on careful investigation and diagnosis, by comparison with the mix of social reform, recreational, and socialization services offered by settlements—and the leaders of the new profession could convincingly argue to universities, philanthropists, and the Russell Sage Foundation that this “core technology” required extended training in professional schools. (To obtain public support, professions needed to convince others that, without the training they provide, consumers would be endangered—an assertion the leaders of the new profession made unabashedly as they argued that good intentions and altruism, by themselves, were insufficient to provide assistance to destitute families, disrupted families, mental patients, and other people in need.) The emphasis of the new profession on training staff to work in nongovernment agencies was also attuned to an era that had few government services, aside from poorhouses, mental institutions, and correctional facilities. * If we place the emerging profession in the larger context of the Progressive Era, we can see that its leaders were captive to the intellectual currents and political assumptions of the period. Many of them were content to seek the regulation of child labor, women’s working conditions, and other specific situations; they did not envision major social programs such as those in the New Deal. Many of them sought reforms of government, including the eradication of patronage and corruption from the administration of mental institutions and poorhouses. Many brought into the profession a preoccupation with the investigation and diagnosis of dispossessed and impoverished individuals that derived from charity projects in the 1840s and later decades. Just as social reformers often stood at the periphery of progressivism, which was mostly preoccupied with the establishment of “good government,” trust-busting, and moral issues like temperance, they often were at the periphery, also, of the emerging profession. Indeed, Richmond believed that the settlements’ mixture of social reform, recreation, and socialization work was an unsuitable methodology for the new profession—and even inimical to its survival. Like the leaders of the charity societies, most leaders of the new profession assumed that nongovernment agencies would provide the focus of its work. Indeed, they looked with considerable cynicism at patronage-ridden public agencies such as mental institutions and poorhouses. It was too soon to tell, in 1920, precisely how the new profession would develop. Given that both the charity society and settlement movements shared an emphasis on helping people in poverty, that aspect of social work was likely to continue. A social reform impulse deriving from the influence of settlement workers and certain charity society people, such as Homer Folks, was likely to remain. But a clever prognosticator might have guessed that tensions in the profession at its inception would also persist. Might not casework, soon to be married to the just-emerging tenets of Freud (and later the tenets of so many other psychological theorists), lead some practitioners to want to serve neurotic individuals from the middle and even upper classes rather than poor people? Might not the descendants of Jane Addams within the profession—those who wished to emphasize macro matters such as policy, administration, organizing, and social reform—be marginalized in a profession whose organizing principles reflected the person-to-person transactions of the charity societies? Would not endless disputes emerge about the precise educational content of the professional schools—and even whether a master’s degree in a graduate facility was necessary or whether certain tasks could be performed by people with only a bachelor’s degree? (We will discuss in Chapter 6 and elsewhere how some of these tensions emerged over the next few decades.) Lest we imply that social workers alone were subject to the limitations of their time, consider physicians and attorneys, who tightened the educational requirements of their disciplines in this era and made salutary advances but also made decisions that set back the course of social reform in the United States. Although the medical profession had existed for centuries, it did not possess a monopoly over health care in the mid 19th century. Prior to the discovery of bacteria and an understanding of their role in illness, herbalists and other folk practitioners seemed as credible as physicians. The revolutionary scientific discoveries in Europe in the last four decades of the 19th century, which led to the development of inoculations, safer surgical techniques, and effective medications, checked scourges such as cholera, syphilis, and typhoid fever—and lent to physicians, who claimed credit for these new findings, a credibility that rival professions lacked. Seizing the moment, physicians organized a grassroots campaign—conducted by chapters of the AMA—to have state legislatures pass licensing laws that would require providers of surgical and pharmaceutical remedies to hold a medical degree. Like social workers, they linked their training facilities to universities and required a bachelor’s degree for admission to them. Who would dispute the fact that this profession made salutary contributions to society as it waged war on ancient epidemics? But the medical profession also retarded social reform and, in some cases, restricted human rights. As we have already noted, the profession medicalized many of women’s health conditions, such as childbirth, and subjected women to strange remedies such as months of bed rest and an epidemic of hysterectomies. Many physicians opposed the use of birth control on the grounds that women should not interfere with natural processes of reproduction. Moreover, physicians were not reluctant to profess knowledge of sexual matters; their pronouncement that homosexual behavior was medical pathology was not reversed until the 1980s. Leaders of the AMA had entertained the notion of government health insurance (by the various states) in the early 20th century, as they observed successful projects by the English and Germans, but swung against the notion in the years before and after World War I. Indeed, they launched a campaign of virulent invective against the proponents of health insurance, which included many progressive reformers and social workers; health reformers were called “bolsheviks,” “communists,” and a threat to “the physician–patient relationship.” When they coupled this invective with a well-financed lobbying campaign in all states that were entertaining the idea of health insurance, they established the AMA as the primary lobbying group in the health field. The AMA’s campaign helped convince large segments of the public that health insurance was un-American. It was so effective that it sabotaged the enactment of health insurance in the 1930s, the late 1940s, and the 1970s—and nearly blocked passage of lesser measures such as Medicare in the 1960s. The AMA also retarded the development of a strong public health system in the United States by arguing on many occasions that even inoculations should be done only by private physicians. * The AMA’s reactionary tendencies were illustrated by its strident opposition to the Sheppard-Towner bill, a modest measure initiated by social workers in 1918 that sought to improve maternal and child health facilities and services in rural areas through federal grants to state health departments. Although the legislation was enacted in 1921, its proponents had to overcome charges that it represented “state medicine.” Pathetically small, this program struggled to survive and finally succumbed in 1929, largely because the medical profession “sought (successfully) to wrest control of infant and maternal health from female-run public clinics and place it, instead, in the hands of private, male physicians.” * The legal profession also threw roadblocks in the path of reform. Recall that progressives were interested in regulatory reforms, mostly in state and local jurisdictions. As we have already noted, the Supreme Court struck down legislation to limit hours of work for men and to prohibit child labor. Moreover, many Supreme Court justices continued to believe that the Constitution did not sanction the federal government’s intrusion into social matters, except under very limited conditions that involved a specified power of the federal government, such as its jurisdiction over interstate commerce. (Recall from Chapter 3 that the Constitution reserved to the states all powers not specified in it—and, aside from vague clauses like the general welfare clause, the Constitution was silent on social policy matters.) Social reformers thus had to ponder how to frame social legislation so that it would conform to the narrow and specific wording of the Constitution. Amending the Constitution, although possible in principle, was difficult in practice. Congress passed a constitutional amendment in 1924 to authorize federal laws regulating the labor of youth under the age of 18, but the amendment failed to gain ratification by three-fourths of the states, and thus did not pass into law. The intransigence of the courts, and particularly the Supreme Court, enraged progressive reformers like Theodore Roosevelt. Because the Constitution gives Congress the power to organize and establish rules for the Supreme Court, progressive reformers proposed taking the powers of constitutional review from the Supreme Court by legislation—or increasing the size of the Court to dilute the power of its sitting justices. These projects were not successful. In 1916, however, reformers did succeed in securing the appointment to the Court of Louis Brandeis—an attorney who advocated “sociological jurisprudence,” which would factor the effects of laws on the well-being of citizens into constitutional rulings—over an avalanche of protests by many jurists and conservatives who alleged that he would disregard the intentions of the framers of the Constitution. Similar conflicts between progressives and the Supreme Court would emerge in the succeeding decades, including in the administration of Barack Obama. These legal disputes in the Progressive Era gave the Supreme Court a central role in the unfolding of social reform. Until about 1938, as we will note in ensuing chapters, a succession of adverse rulings by the Supreme Court enormously delayed the federal government’s assumption of responsibility for social policy. Even after the Court had acceded to the notion that the federal government could establish social programs and regulations, it remained a key player in shaping the content of those decisions. (We note in later chapters how relatively liberal rulings of the 1950s and 1960s assumed enormous importance in speeding social reforms and how a succession of more conservative rulings in the 1980s through 2011 aligned the Court against social reformers.) * Analyze the Evolution of the Reluctant W elfare State Progressives dramatically expanded social obligation to include a host of regulations, as well as a limited set of social programs such as mothers’ pensions and workmen’s compensation. These accomplishments may not appear dramatic or far-reaching to contemporary citizens, but they constituted remarkable innovations in a society where social policy had previously been restricted to poorhouses, mental institutions, prisons, schools, and houses of refuge. The progressives made a contribution to the development of the modern welfare state by championing the role of government in addressing social problems, although their emphasis was usually on regulation at state and local levels. Government, they believed, could serve as a force for the amelioration of social needs rather than as merely a passive umpire that preserved law and order. Further, many progressives believed that government need not merely provide funds and concessions to affluent persons and corporations but also ought to assist vulnerable populations such as women, children, immigrants, and factory workers. In a sense, then, progressives legitimized a vision of positive and compassionate government that had not hitherto been expressed as widely or as articulately in a nation preoccupied with laissez-faire doctrines and the deification of moneyed elites. The policies that they enacted, in turn, served to educate the nation’s citizens to the possibilities of government action, as workers, renters, and consumers benefited from improvements in working conditions, housing, and public health. Nonetheless, the progressive movement must be viewed as having made only modest social welfare innovations in a nation with extraordinary social needs. Regulations hardly constituted frontal assaults on poverty, low LO 5-13 wages, or industrial accidents. Workmen’s compensation and mothers’ pensions were limited programs by any standards. The nation instituted notable public health reforms, but within a larger flawed model of medical care. When compared with European nations, the United States spent paltry sums on domestic programs—sums that were not markedly increased by the progressive reformers. Few Americans empathized with the social needs of African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans; indeed, many progressives were deeply suspicious of these groups and were also prejudiced against immigrants. Many reformers realized that low-income and working-class Americans would need to rally behind a reform-minded president if the nation were to develop more far-reaching reforms. But it was unclear how such a reform constituency could develop; the failed campaign of the Progressive Party in 1912 illustrated how far there was still to go. As we will discuss in Chapter 7 , it took the catastrophe of the Great Depression to push the nation to develop major federal social programs, and it took the leadership of President Franklin Roosevelt—a relative of President Theodore Roosevelt —to achieve the political realignment that the progressives had fantasized might be possible. Link the Progressive Era to Contemporary Society What W e Can Learn from Policy Advocates of the Progressive Era EP 4c Moral outrage at such indignities as those suffered by children laboring in factories, immigrants toiling for virtually no pay, and tenants living in squalid conditions was the catalyst for the policy practice and advocacy of Jane Addams (see Insert 5.5 ). We now present a profile of Paul Kellogg. See Insert 5.6 . Insert 5.6. Proﬁles in Policy Advocacy: Paul Underwood Kellogg (1879–1958) Paul Underwood Kellogg believed that, if citizens had access to the facts of social justice in America, they would take action to improve the human condition around them. As a journalist, he also believed that presenting facts to the citizenry was most effective when the facts were expressed in terms of real people and real situations. Paul Underwood Kellogg’s contribution to the social reform movement of the early LO 5-14 1900s was his ability to keep the public well informed of labor conditions in America and social justice everywhere. Kellogg was born on September 30, 1879, in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He was the youngest son born to Frank Israel and Mary Foster (Underwood) Kellogg. His father owned a lumber business until the early 1890s. Shortly after the company failed, Kellogg’s father abandoned his family and moved to Texas. Kellogg’s interest in journalism began when he was a teenager. In high school, Kellogg was named class historian. After graduating in 1897, he was given a job on the editorial staff of the Kalamazoo Daily Telegraph. In 1901, Kellogg left Michigan to attend Columbia University in New York City. In the summer of 1902, he studied at the New York Charity Organization Society’s Summer School of Philanthropy. In that same year, Kellogg was hired by Edward T. Devine as assistant editor of Charities, the Society’s official publication. By 1903, Paul, who was now joined by his brother Arthur Piper Kellogg, worked on expanding the scope of Charities, which they accomplished by merging it with the Commons, the official publication of the settlement house movement. In February 1905, Kellogg married Helen Hall, administrator and head resident of New York City’s Henry Street Settlement, a settlement house where the couple resided for many years. Although Kellogg contributed many articles to the literature on social conditions in America, he is best remembered for his work on the Pittsburgh Survey. Together with a team of scholars and community leaders from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Kellogg gathered information on nearly every aspect of life in the city. He subsequently published the group’s findings in articles and later in a six-volume series. His methods of gathering information in general and the Pittsburgh Survey in particular served as a model for later sociological surveys. More important, the Survey was instrumental in keeping the citizenry informed of facts related to working conditions, housing conditions, and other areas in need of reform. (The Pittsburgh Survey led to reform efforts to shorten the industrial workweek, improve housing, and provide workers’ compensation coverage.) Between 1907 and 1908, prior to returning to his New York office, Kellogg headed the Pittsburgh Survey research team. Once back in New York, he began reshaping Charities and the Commons into the Survey, which later became social work’s semi-official journal. The Survey was widely recognized as a stalwart reporter of the social decay in America and the policies and programs that sought to reverse it. In 1912, Paul Underwood Kellogg became editor-in-chief of the Survey, and his brother Arthur became managing editor. In keeping with his conviction that a well-informed public would support social reform, Kellogg kept the Survey’s agenda broad enough to include coverage of issues that other publications stayed away from. The Survey dealt with major issues of urban and rural America during the first half of the 1900s, including housing, recreation, urban renewal, improvement of industrial conditions and workers’ benefits, social insurance, regional planning, public health, and environmental conservation. The Survey also allowed the editorial staff to explore other issues in depth, including issues on the African American community, coal mining and labor conditions, Mexico, fascism, unemployment, juvenile delinquency, and many other subjects. The Survey’s small staff of writers was made up of many early 20th-century reformers, who often worked for little or no pay. Between 1911 and 1913, Paul Kellogg was secretary to the Committee to Secure a Federal Commission on Industrial Relations and was founder and director of the Foreign Policy Association. Throughout his career, he was extremely supportive of and active in the National Federation of Settlements, the American Association of Social Workers, and the National Conference on Social Welfare. In 1934 and 1935, he served as vice chair of an advisory council to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Committee on Economic Security, which helped create the framework for the Social Security Act. Paul Underwood Kellogg’s life and career were devoted to informing the American public about the social conditions many of his critics would have preferred to ignore. Kellogg, who was not a trained social worker, used his expertise in journalism to promote social reform by appealing to the American conscience. If Addams possessed organizing and leadership skills that are needed by policy advocates, Paul Kellogg—her close friend and ally—provided pivotal data that buttressed progressives’ arguments that large numbers of Americans lived in abject poverty. Paul Kellogg made it clear that social science and policy advocacy go hand in hand (see Insert 5.6 ). Progressive reformers often possessed relatively little empirical data about the social conditions they wanted to correct, such as the actual number of immigrants, their income levels, and their social conditions. We take for granted in contemporary society the collection of such statistics by an array of government authorities, such as the U.S. Census Bureau, and private research groups, such as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Urban Institute, and the Brookings Institution. Compared with modern policy advocates, progressive reformers had scant information—a condition that Kellogg hoped to partly correct through a survey of Pittsburgh, a prototypical industrial city that relied heavily on immigrant labor. The so- called Pittsburgh Survey exposed the sheer magnitude of harsh economic and social conditions that immigrants experienced. A false dichotomy is sometimes evident among academics even in contemporary society between those who seek policy reforms through “policy analysis” (which uses data extensively) and “policy activism” (which uses community and political organizing). Both data and organizing are needed to achieve policy reforms. Kellogg also illustrated how policy advocates need to make extensive use of the mass media to heighten public awareness of social conditions that need to be addressed through policy reforms. He edited a series of publications that disseminated information to the American public, including the influential magazine, The Survey, that was a kind of ongoing documentary of social conditions that needed to be reformed, as well as promising policy proposals. What W e Can Learn from the Persistence of Unmet Needs and Policy Issues during the Progressive Era After the nation enacted restrictive and racist immigration legislation in 1924 that greatly reduced immigration from non-European nations, it was widely assumed that massive immigration to the United States had permanently ended. In fact, tens of millions of immigrants entered the United States from the mid-1960s to the present with a radical shift from European nations to Mexico, Central America, and Asia. These immigrants came to the United States for many reasons and in many ways. Some of them were refugees from civil conflict and civil wars in such places as Bosnia, Kosovo, Guatemala, El Salvador, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. Large numbers came to the United States in the wake of the Vietnam War. Others were persons seeking asylum from dictatorial regimes in Russia and Eastern Europe. Some came through the established immigration procedures such as obtaining so-called green cards to perform specific work and get specific education in the United States. Others received amnesty from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which granted amnesty to three million undocumented workers—mostly from Mexico and Central America—who could prove they had lived in the United States for at least four years. Still others were undocumented persons who came into the United States to find work or to join family members—an estimated 12 million persons in 2007. While most of these immigrants voluntarily entered the United States to better their economic condition, just like immigrants of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many encountered abysmal conditions. Take the example of New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. When low-income African Americans fled the city, corporations aggressively advertised in Mexican and Asian cities for workers who could legally enter the United States, but only if they worked for specific named corporations. Promised fair wages and good working conditions, they soon found themselves exploited by American corporations that often paid them less than the minimum wage or not at all, failed to provide them with work safety equipment even as they often demolished buildings containing asbestos and toxic chemicals, often required them to work for 12 hours per day, and stated or implied they would be sent to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for deportation if they complained about their pay or working conditions. They lived in motels with as many as 10 persons in a room. The United States has engaged for decades, then, in a hypocritical game of exploiting immigrants’ labor at low wage rates for jobs that many Americans will not accept, accepting their Social Security payments and other taxes, yet not granting them the right to safety net programs and protections that other working Americans receive. Afraid of deportation, immigrants rarely report theft or violence against themselves to the police. Some are even reluctant to send their children to public school for fear of exposure to the INS. The plight of immigrants from Mexico is particularly appalling because, as we learned in Chapter 4 , most of the American Southwest, parts of Colorado, and California ought to belong to Mexico. This land was ceded to the United States only because it invaded Mexico, conquered Mexico City, and forced the Mexican government at gunpoint to sign the Treaty of Guadalupe. Even Abraham Lincoln concluded that American conduct in the Mexican-American War was ethically reprehensible. As this edition goes to press in 2018, the federal government has been unable to fashion immigration legislation that would grant amnesty to millions of immigrants currently in the nation, while establishing a humane system for providing work visas to others in coming decades. If President Obama’s effort to secure this legislation was gridlocked in 2014, President Trump was hostile to immigrants. What W e Can Learn from Failed Policy Strategies of the Progressive Era While progressive reformers are to be lauded for trying to create some social reforms in a society with only a primitive welfare state, they failed sufficiently to expand their horizons to the federal government. Social problems such as unemployment, poverty, and oppression of vulnerable populations require substantial federal direction and resources if they are to be addressed adequately. It took the Great Depression in the 1930s and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s to make clear that state and local governments, left to their own devices and resources, cannot address national problems adequately. In their defense, progressives sought reforms in a context that was not hospitable to bolder reforms, so progressives’ failure to develop more ambitious reforms reflected these realities. In some ways, progressive reformers can be viewed as showing that government can assume a proactive role in addressing social problems, even if their reforms represented only a small step toward the creation of a more humane American welfare state. What W e Can Learn from Promising Strategies of the Progressive Era Most persons think about social programs when they discuss welfare states, such as the various safety net programs like SNAP, Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and subsidized housing. Few persons realize that any humane welfare state must also contain many regulations—the kinds of regulations that progressives initiated. Free-market conservatives often contend that government regulations are both unnecessary and ineffective. They correctly note that corporations often must expend considerable amounts of resources to achieve compliance. They correctly contend that government expenses must expand to monitor compliance with regulations. They often argue that free markets work best when regulations do not exist. Conservatives fail to remember, however, the social conditions of the late 19th century when almost no regulations existed. Minus regulations, unethical businesses, professionals, developers, landlords, public officials, and others had free rein to exploit clients, workers, and the general public. Had not progressives and several succeeding generations of reformers developed myriad regulations to protect vulnerable populations—and Americans in general—from exploitation by corporations, landlords, owners of child care and nursing home institutions, and others, many Americans would be unnecessarily victimized. As our discussion of exploited immigrants in post-Katrina New Orleans suggests, yet additional reforms are needed to protect vulnerable populations such as immigrants. The need for government regulations over banking and the financial system became clear during the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009 and beyond. As we discuss in Chapter 12 , speculative activities by banks and investment houses precipitated the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. We also discuss bank and credit-card regulations in Chapter 12 that afford consumers protections and that provide some safeguards from excessive speculation by banks. What We Can Learn from the Progressive Era about the Structure of the American W elfare State Social workers need to be familiar with the regulatory side of the American welfare state. For example, they need to be able to refer clients to local authorities when they reside in inadequate structures that violate local building codes and to refer clients to authorities that regulate work conditions when they are exposed to unsafe conditions. Progressives were the prime movers in developing these regulations, as indicated in Box 5.1 , which lists the major progressive reforms that regulated the political process, banking and economic institutions, conditions of employment, food and drugs, employment of immigrants, and housing. Although most were enacted in local jurisdictions, they also gave state and federal governments new policy roles. Box 5.1. Selected Regulations Enacted in the Progressive Era Regulations of Industrialists Curtailment of the size of trusts (federal) Limitation of working hours of women and children (local) Regulation of working conditions in plants (local) Regulations of the Food and Drug Industry Restrictions placed on the content and labeling of food and drugs (federal and local) Regulations of Developers and Owners of Rental Properties Housing codes (local) and development of zoning laws to govern construction Regulations of Politicians Passage of initiative, referendum, and recall procedures (local) Restrictions on lobbying and campaign contributions (local) Limitation of patronage through passage of civil service legislation (local and federal) Curtailment of the power of machines and bosses through the establishment of nonpartisan elections and commissions (local) Protections for Immigrants Controls on persons who hire immigrants (federal and local) Protections for Women Curbs on interstate transportation of nonconsenting women to prevent kidnapping for prostitution (federal) and laws to restrict prostitution (local) Development of Fire Codes Controls on construction of industrial facilities as well as housing (local) Regulations of Taverns and Distilleries Enactment of prohibition (local) Regulations of Immigration Many proposals advanced to restrict immigration (federal) Regulations of Banks Laws regulating reserve requirements of banks (federal) Regulations Governing Professional Activities Enactment of licensing laws for medical, dental, legal, and other professional activities (local) Public Health Regulations Laws regulating disposal of sewage and garbage as well as food processing in restaurants (local) Working Hours of Women and Children Laws regulating hours and working conditions of women and children (local and federal) Working Hours of Federal Employees Federal legislation limiting the hours of work of federal employees Many regulations have been enacted, of course, in the decades following the Progressive Era up to the present. As just one example, civil rights legislation from the mid-1960s to the present has greatly expanded regulations that diminish discriminatory actions against members of vulnerable populations. We will discuss discuss many of these regulations in succeeding chapters.

Social Policy in a Relatively Liberal Era Introduction The Progressive Movement had initiated some initial social policies in local and state government in the first decades of the 20th century, but had mostly failed to obtain policies at the federal level of government. Part 4 discusses social policies in three eras of the 20th century that did develop hundreds of social policies over a period of more than 43 years that addressed an array of residents’ economic, medical, housing, mental health, nutrition, education, preschool, seniors’ child-welfare, childcare, employment and other needs. They were able to finance these programs with revenues mostly collected by the federal income tax that had been enacted in 1913. (States and localities often shared these costs with the federal government.) In other words, the United States finally had a “welfare state” even if was a reluctant one that failed to address residents’ needs sufficiently. As you read chapters about Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, L yndon Johnson’s Great Society, and Richard Nixon’s reforms, ask what political, cultural, and economic factors contributed to the rise of the American welfare state, as well as to its major omissions.

Could the still-primitive American welfare state find ways to address the social needs of a population devastated by this catastrophe—and at a time when knowledge about how to restore economic growth was scant? Social policy was transformed during this decade as Americans finally fashioned a series of social reforms that far surpassed the local and regulatory reforms of the Progressive Era and brought the federal government into a position of policy prominence. Government institutions, the presidency, politics, and the courts were also transformed during this fateful decade. Bold as its reforms were by the standards of preceding decades, the social reforms of the 1930s were far too timid to address the nation’s social needs —or to end the Great Depression. Reforms during and immediately after the Great Depression can best be understood by analyzing the unfolding of reform in five periods: 1. During the era of denial (1929 to March 1933), Americans were so stunned by the economic catastrophe that they took little corrective action. 1941 America enters World War II; Executive Order 8802 prohibits discrimination in war industry 1942 Some 120,000 persons of Japanese ancestry evacuated to relocation centers 1945 Roosevelt dies and is succeeded by Harry Truman 2. During the period of emergency reforms (March 1933 to January 1935), Americans supported a bewildering number of reforms but tended to believe that prosperity would soon return and that these reforms were temporary. 3. During the era of institutionalized reform (January 1935 to January 1937), Americans made a number of reforms permanent. 4. During an era of policy stalemate (January 1937 to December 1941), the momentum of New Deal reform was decisively broken. 5. During the era of pullback in World War II (December 1941 to August 1945), many of the New Deal programs were rescinded, but a core of New Deal reforms remained intact and became the foundation of the modern American welfare state. At the end of this chapter, we discuss what we can learn in contemporary society about policy advocacy, social policy, and the structure of the American welfare state from the worst economic catastrophe in U.S. history. We explore similarities and differences between approaches used by Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Barack Obama in addressing major economic crises. Understand the Turn toward Conservatism in the 1920s EP 3a EP 5c The progressive reform momentum was shattered when Americans focused on preparations for World War I, the war effort, and postwar diplomacy, including an ill-fated League of Nations. However, this period did yield a few reforms, such as federal directives requiring recipients of war contracts not to use child labor. * In the 1920s, as in the 1950s and the 1980s, many Americans believed that economic activity carried out by private enterprise, left unfettered by government, would bring unlimited prosperity. The nation was presided over by three Republican presidents, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover, who strenuously resisted efforts of a small cadre of social reformers. * Harding stated his philosophy succinctly when he said, “What we want in America is less government in business and more business in government.” A second American industrial revolution occurred during the 1920s. Steel, mining, and railroad industries had developed during the first revolution; the second focused on consumer products—such as cars, radios, and refrigerators—and on the electrification of homes and industries. Enormous consumer needs remained unmet in the United States; only 1 in 10 urban homes was electrified in 1920; only 1 in 100 households possessed a radio; LO 6-1 and only 1 in 3 families had a car. Consumer appetites for new products were whetted by the rise of a large advertising industry. * A trickle-down economic philosophy was dominant. Officials believed that economic assistance to affluent persons and industry stimulated investments that could bring jobs to poor and working-class Americans. The low tariffs of the prewar era were supplanted by protective tariffs for American industry; federal taxes had been increased to pay off the national debt in the wake of World War I, but new tax laws reduced them to one-quarter of their previous level; and many regulations that had been enacted during the Progressive Era were relaxed, not implemented, or struck down by the courts. * Policies that empowered industry and affluent persons were supplemented by vigorous suppression of organized labor. Companies sought to obtain the goodwill of employees by developing stock-sharing schemes, providing fringe benefits, and starting company unions that ostensibly gave workers a mechanism for negotiating higher benefits and wages. When unions tried to organize, their leaders were often intimidated or fired—and strikes led to unabashed use of scabs, local police, the National Guard, and injunctions from courts that were usually favorable to management. * Social reformers were on the defensive during the 1920s; some were stigmatized as radicals, communists, or traitors. African Americans continued to live under oppressive Jim Crow laws in the South, encountered race riots and residential segregation in the North, and found it difficult to obtain jobs in the industries that were now producing consumer goods in the second industrial revolution. Although African Americans were a significant presence in many Northern cities, most continued to work for white planters in the South. * Latinos and Asian Americans continued to experience rampant prejudice and adverse policies in the West and Southwest. * Women experienced new sexual freedoms in the era of the flapper, but found that their voting privileges did not lead to major policy reforms that would give them access to more remunerative work or to the professions. * Americans were intrigued by social change and often tended to glamorize technology and science, but they were also fearful of new ideas; in the famous Scopes trial in 1925, for example, a schoolteacher was successfully prosecuted for teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee school. (The verdict was later overturned on a technicality.) Prohibition, enacted in the form of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution in 1919, was supported by many Protestants, who insisted that local and federal officials strictly enforce the legislation. * Many Americans supported stringent reductions of immigration, whether on racial grounds or because they believed the nation could no longer absorb immigrants. The Immigration Act of 1924 was blatantly racist; its goal was to maintain the “racial preponderance [of] the basic strain of our people.” A limit of 150,000 people was placed on immigration each year, with quotas for each nationality in proportion to its size in the existing population. This policy was intended to reduce the proportion of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. A complete prohibition was placed on Japanese immigration. * In contrast to these conservative reforms, which sought to restore traditional American values, there was a new interest in exploring sexual liberation and the psyche. Sigmund Freud was not taken seriously in his native Europe, but his theories—though not immediately adopted by social work practitioners—swept America, much as those of Herbert Spencer had done in the Gilded Age. * The profession of social work grew rapidly during the 1920s. By 1929, 25 graduate schools existed, several professional associations had developed, and three journals disseminated information. Casework emerged as the central skill during the decade; its practitioners outnumbered other kinds of social workers by a threefold margin. Mary Richmond’s classic treatise during the Progressive Era had emphasized familial, neighborhood, and societal realities, but in the 1920s, some caseworkers became excited about the personality—so much so that they risked ignoring environmental realities as well as the need for social reforms. Caseworkers tended to be employed in not-for-profit agencies and were often relatively contemptuous of public agencies, which some of them believed should aid only paupers and persons with chronic and severe mental conditions. * Some still proposed more fundamental reforms, but they were decidedly on the fringes of American society. Surface impressions of prosperity in the 1920s were misleading because unemployment ranged from 5% to 13%, and agriculture was in a state of depression throughout the decade. Although the upper third of the populace conspicuously purchased consumer products, the lower third were often unemployed or lived near or below the poverty level in a society that had few government income transfer programs. * Analyze Why the Depression Began EP 2a The Great Depression began with the collapse of the stock market in October 1929. A speculative frenzy during the 1920s had led to higher and higher stock prices, with many investors relying on credit for stock purchases. When stock prices plunged, panicked investors rushed to sell their stocks—leading to even greater declines in stock prices. The panic soon spread beyond the stock market to banks, which had also overextended themselves by making loans without retaining sufficient reserves. As the word spread about the banks’ growing insolvency, people rushed to take their savings from them—adding to the banks’ insolvency. With the collapse of the stock markets and banks, the rest of the economy was doomed. As consumers lacked resources to purchase goods and services, businesses slashed prices to encourage consumption of their products—a strategy that lowered their profits and forced them to lay off workers. As unemployment precipitously rose to encompass 25% of all workers, demand for products declined yet further and precipitated even more layoffs, creating a vicious circle. Persons of all social classes were devastated by economic suffering and resorted to desperate and improvisational survival strategies. Some moved into tents in the countryside during the summer; three or more families shared apartments; groups of single women shared apartments and lived from the wages of a single worker; people tried to grow produce in gardens; and teenagers roamed the countryside when their families could not support LO 6-2 them. Lorena Hickok, a reporter who was commissioned by Eleanor Roosevelt to tour the country in a car, documented the suffering of members of all social classes in daily letters to the first lady. * White-collar Americans feared foreclosure or evictions, had to pawn family possessions, were ashamed that their neighbors might discover they were on relief, and shunned clothes made in the sewing rooms of relief programs. Malnutrition and starvation were widely reported; thousands of children were placed in summer camps to give them adequate food. Medical care was lacking for members of all classes, as many physicians and hospitals refused service to persons with no money. Even on welfare, many individuals lacked funds to heat or light their homes or to purchase clothing. Foreclosures, evictions, layoffs, family disruption, and suicides were commonplace. When touring major American cities in 1932, Harry Hopkins observed that the hundreds of thousands of Americans who lined the streets to watch Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s procession did not protest, yell, or applaud but stood in stunned silence. * This widespread suffering persisted throughout the decade, despite periodic upturns in the economy. (See Figure 6.1 .) Even when the economy improved slightly, however, vast numbers of persons could not find employment. When Congress impatiently imposed a rule in 1939 that no one could receive more than 18 months of work relief, investigators found that more than two-thirds of recipients had to return to work relief because they could not find jobs. * Figure 6.1.

Controversy exists about the precise causes of the Great Depression in 1929. * Some theorists contend that the nation’s economic expansion was halted because industry and affluent persons had insufficient capital at their disposal. However, the aforementioned trickle-down policies placed vast sums of money in the coffers of affluent persons and corporations. Other theorists argue convincingly that the Great Depression occurred because the majority of American consumers lacked sufficient resources to purchase consumer goods. Some economists implicate excessive speculation and protective tariffs. Whatever its precise causes, the Great Depression of 1929, like the depression of 1893, put an immediate and decisive halt to prosperity, suggested that trickle-down policies were not a panacea, and alerted Americans to the realities of poverty, unemployment, and economic injustice. Assess the Period of Denial: 1929–1933 EP 2a EP 7a The immediate reality of massive unemployment, depressed stock prices, lost fortunes, bankrupt companies, and deflated prices was obvious to everyone in 1929, including Herbert Hoover, the incumbent president. Americans had experienced many economic downturns in their history; however, most persons assumed that economic growth would resume. Herbert Hoover at first seemed ideally suited to solve the nation’s problems. A civil engineer who had orchestrated a massive food relief program for starving Europeans after World War I, he prided himself on a problem- solving style in which political considerations were given a minor role. He believed, like most Americans, that modest tinkering with the economic system would bring the nation out of its economic doldrums. In accordance with trickle-down economics, he favored passage of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which processed $2 billion for loans to corporations and banks, as well as various projects to encourage economic activity by bankers and corporations. To appease critics, and because he did not believe in major government programs, however, Hoover implemented these policies in a restrictive manner; he insisted, for example, that corporations and banks prove that they were on the verge of bankruptcy before they would be eligible for loans under the RFC. * LO 6-3 Hoover also believed that private agencies, principally the Red Cross and family service agencies, could address the needs of unemployed and poverty-stricken Americans without government assistance. He shared Franklin Pierce’s ideology—enunciated in the Pierce veto of nearly a century earlier—that welfare issues belonged to local government and to private philanthropy. Some historians have emphasized progressive elements of Hoover’s ideology, but the preponderance of evidence suggests that he was an inflexible conservative who adhered to Social Darwinism and equated federal social programs with socialism. * Hoover’s measures did not address the mounting economic needs of local governments, which were moving toward bankruptcy as their welfare expenditures increased. Pressure from the Congress to help local governments finally led to passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act in 1932, which authorized federal loans to local governments that could prove they had become bankrupt. However, as the depression worsened, some Americans began to wonder whether more drastic measures were needed. A small group of liberal politicians in the House and the Senate proposed measures that seemed radical to many Americans, such as federal funding of major public works projects, the development of federally funded employment offices, federal funding of unemployment and old age insurance, the development of dams, and reforestation projects to create jobs and economic growth in rural areas. * Senators Robert Wagner of New York, Robert La Follette of Wisconsin, and Edward Costigan of Colorado led this small cadre of reformers. They drew from some proposals fashioned in the 1920s by the American Association of Old Age Security, a reform group headed by Isaac Rubinow, who introduced to the United States concepts of social insurance that had been pioneered in Europe. * Even relatively conservative big-city bosses, such as Mayor James Curley of Boston, urged job creation and public works programs that went beyond the timid measures of Hoover. * Hoover became more conservative, however, as the nation gradually moved toward more liberal ideas. An inflexible man who was isolated from, and insensitive to, political realities, he resorted to budget balancing and various monetary solutions to complement his woefully inadequate programs. He bitterly attacked liberals for advocating policies that he viewed as socialistic measures that would compound the nation’s economic problems (see Insert 6.1 ). * Insert 6.1. Critical Analysis: Which Social Problems Are Recognized? When Hoover failed to recognize the extent and duration of unemployment from 1929 onward, he illustrated a recurring tendency of policy makers to deny the existence of important problems. 1. Identify some major social problems in recent American history that policy makers failed to recognize or to take seriously, such as failure by most economists to realize the United States teetered on the edge of a major recession in 2006. 2. Identify other social problems that policy makers did take seriously (e.g., by proposing major legislation or allocating major funding to address them). 3. What political, cultural, economic, or other factors seem to make policy makers deny some problems while taking others seriously? 4. Can advocates for specific social problems speed up the clock? In other words, is there some way they can gain policy makers’ attention more promptly? (See the policy advocacy framework in Figure 2.1 , which discusses the agenda-building task of policy advocates.) The nation’s confidence in business—and in Hoover—began to waver by 1930. Hoover had won a sweeping victory in 1928, but the Republican Party suffered such extensive losses in the congressional elections of 1930 that its majority was reduced to a narrow margin. Most Democrats were as confused by the situation as Hoover, however, as they, too, tended to favor budget cutting, tax reduction, and trickle-down economics to cope with the depression. Though many social workers supported Roosevelt, Jane Addams and some other reformers voted for Hoover in the pivotal election of 1932. * Trace the Emergence of Franklin Roosevelt as a National Figure EP 6a Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was an unlikely person to develop the most sweeping social reforms that the nation had yet seen. He was born into an affluent family in New York State. He seemed destined to have a distinguished political career when he became assistant secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson, but it was cut short when he developed polio in 1921—a devastating disease that meant he could no longer walk without assistance from others and from the use of a heavy apparatus tied to his legs. A ware that public knowledge of his malady would end his political future, he and his family carefully concealed his disease even up to the last months of his presidency in early 1945. Above all, Roosevelt strove to give the appearance that he could walk—finally mastering this deception by relying on his arms to support himself, and with two men on each side of him, as he approached a podium. Polio transformed Roosevelt. His experience made him more sensitive to others whose lives were devastated by polio and other problems such as poverty. * He expended a considerable share of his personal wealth to develop a place where persons with polio could get physical therapy for the illness in Warm Springs, Georgia. He was married, moreover, to a remarkable woman—Eleanor Roosevelt— who pushed and prodded him continually not only to continue his political LO 6-4 career but also to use his power to help others, including women, African Americans, and unemployed persons. She maintained contact with political leaders in New York State as he recovered in the years after he developed polio, allowing him to successfully run for the governorship of New York State in 1928. His governorship was highly successful and positioned him to successfully seek the nomination of the Democratic Party for the presidency in 1932, running against incumbent Herbert Hoover. Roosevelt was not intrinsically a radical, however, and he even disliked persons with strong ideologies on the left or the right. Rather, he was a liberal pragmatist who also had some reservations about large ongoing public programs. As a pragmatist, he was acutely aware of the political context in which he worked, so he took a relatively conservative posture in the presidential campaign of 1932. While he expressed more sympathy for the unemployed than did Hoover and talked vaguely of reforestation schemes, he advocated a balanced budget and conservative fiscal policies and even derided Hoover for spending too much federal money. Roosevelt was different from Hoover, however, even before he became president. He was an innovator, willing to experiment with new initiatives to deal with the massive suffering of unemployed persons until he found something that worked. He carefully slipped into his campaign speeches a proviso that he would have to spend sufficient federal money to avert “dire suffering and starvation” even if that meant running federal deficits. He had already spent large amounts of federal resources as a public official. He had participated in the mobilization of national resources by the federal government as assistant secretary of the Navy in World War I. As governor of New York State between 1928 and 1932, he had initiated the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration (TERA) to provide state funds to local units of government for outdoor relief to the unemployed. He knew many social workers, including Frances Perkins, who headed the Labor Department, and Harry Hopkins, who had worked in private philanthropic agencies and directed the TERA. Roosevelt and the Democrats won a sweeping victory in 1932 primarily because, after three ineffectual Republican presidents in the 1920s, Americans wanted to give the Democrats a chance to address the nation’ s problems. Roosevelt’s infectious optimism was appealing to Americans during a time of trouble, presenting a sharp contrast to Hoover’s dour demeanor. Evaluate the Era of Emergency Reforms: 1933–1936 EP 7a EP 7b EP 7c EP 7d When FDR won his decisive victory in November 1932, policy drift was no longer possible because the banking system was threatened with collapse owing to insufficient funds to cover withdrawals of panic-stricken depositors. Local governments encountered staggering welfare burdens because 20% to 60% of Americans were unemployed in many cities and neighborhoods. Millions of Americans, many of them youths whose parents could no longer support them, roamed the nation; obtained beans, coffee, and floor space from local police; and were told to move on the next day. Economic inequality, which had always been severe, became even more obvious at a time when unskilled and uneducated persons and people of color were massively unemployed. Many farmers lost their farms as they suffered catastrophic losses in a worldwide depression of prices of agricultural produce. Still other farmers fled an extraordinary drought that had developed in Oklahoma and adjacent states, a region that became known as the Dust Bowl. * LO 6-5 American business was in disarray. Prices of products decreased as demand plummeted and as exports were slashed because of the depressed economies of European nations. Consumer demand decreased further when employers reduced their workforces. Businesses went bankrupt as they slashed their prices in a desperate effort to retain customers. The suicide rate of investors, bankers, and company executives rose sharply. * Unions, which had made slow but steady progress in the late 1920s, went into virtual collapse since most workers were too desperate for jobs to contest employers’ wage-cutting policies. Roosevelt knew that if he followed Hoover’s course of timid reforms, the Great Depression would almost certainly continue. He also knew that people would actually die from starvation or be seriously harmed if he did not spend huge amounts of federal resources to get them money that they could use to meet their survival needs. Caught between American dislike of federal deficits and big government and the human suffering caused by the Great Depression, Roosevelt displayed a side of his persona that became his lasting legacy: a proactive ability to put forward unprecedented federal initiatives in an improvisational manner. Yet his reforms were tempered by conservative forces in the context in which he worked. The actual reforms that were enacted in 1933 and 1934 can be understood only in the context of this set of contradictory forces. The Conﬂicted Context: Forces that Promoted Major Reforms Roosevelt’s sweeping personal victory in 1932 was the largest plurality a president had received since 1864, and it provided him with a power base during the remainder of the decade. The progressives’ dream of a relatively liberal political party, which failed in 1912, was partially realized when Roosevelt obtained the votes of an unprecedented proportion of working- class citizens who wanted government to take an active stance in addressing unemployment and poverty. (Republicans, by contrast, obtained most of their support from middle- and upper-class voters.) This substantial realignment of parties on the basis of social class, which continued throughout the 1930s and into succeeding decades, was crucial to the development of social reforms in the Roosevelt administration and beyond. * Roosevelt had extraordinary power because he had gained support not only from the working class but also from a sizable portion of the middle class. Roosevelt appealed to the middle class because he exuded confidence, because they no longer believed that Republicans could solve the economic problems of the nation, and because many of them had been directly affected by the depression. * As the Progressive Era had demonstrated, major reform cannot take place until considerable support exists within the American middle class so as to offset opposition from corporations, affluent persons, conservatives, and middle-class persons who oppose reforms. The strongest pressure for reform derived, however, from the magnitude of human suffering that existed during the 1930s. It is not possible for persons in contemporary society to grasp the extent of this economic catastrophe, which affected persons of all races and social classes, persons of all ages, and both rural and urban Americans. Used to relatively brief recessions, we also must struggle to comprehend an economic catastrophe that lasted more than a decade—finally lifting only in 1941. Anyone who attacked New Deal programs was countered by the harsh realities that Americans confronted— including the constituents of conservative legislators from both parties. Roosevelt’s freedom of action was enhanced by the disarray of Republicans and conservatives following his overwhelming defeat of Hoover. * Business interests, which had traditionally provided considerable support for conservative politicians, were discredited by the economic collapse because their speculation and greed were widely perceived as one of its causes. The catastrophe of the depression shook the nation to its foundations, making residents want bold leaders willing to contemplate policies that would have been unthinkable several years earlier.

Roosevelt and his aides were often in disarray themselves, but they came into office with relatively well-developed ideas and many areas of consensus. * They rejected Thomas Jefferson’s belief that the federal government should mostly attend to international affairs, as well as Adam Smith’s laissez-faire economics and John Locke’s restricted definition of government—beliefs that had dominated American politics from 1800 to the Great Depression save for the interlude of the Progressive Era. Roosevelt and his inner circle of advisors—the “brain trust”—did not know the precise solutions, but they reasoned that interventions could be devised in a trial-and-error fashion until something worked. Nor should we forget the crucial role played by Roosevelt’s wife, Eleanor. She pressured him, almost nonstop, to attend to an endless list of domestic needs. She placed notes in a box near his bed so that he could read her social reform suggestions as he retired in the evening—prompting him at one point to plead that she restrict her suggestions to a specific number per day so that he could respond to all of them! The Conﬂicted Context: Forces that Limited Roosevelt’ s Initial Policy Initiatives Roosevelt realized that conservatives were a potential threat to social reforms. The conservative National Economic League had fought even the limited reforms of the Hoover administration. Although many businessmen supported specific pieces of New Deal legislation, they tended to be suspicious of Roosevelt both for his rhetoric—he often singled out the wealthy, bankers, and speculators for criticism—and for his expansion of federal power. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce stoutly resisted reforms in local and national arenas. * Roosevelt encountered formidable political opposition from both political parties throughout the decade. Coopted by corporate interests during the 1920s, the leadership of the Democratic Party favored high tariffs, limited assistance to poor persons, and a small federal bureaucracy. Roosevelt’s victory over Newton Baker in the Democratic convention in 1932 was a decisive blow to this traditional leadership, but it maintained a strong—and hostile—presence in the party and often opposed Roosevelt’s initiatives. * In the early 1930s, most churches were profoundly conservative; Boston clergy from most faiths, for example, opposed federal and state programs to help the poor. * Many leaders of the Catholic Church became staunch defenders of the New Deal, but its bishops nonetheless opposed passage of child labor regulations, which they believed interfered with the privacy of the family. * Even though more than half the American population lived in cities during the 1930s, local, state, and national legislatures were dominated by rural legislators, who were often insensitive to the needs of city dwellers. * Labor leaders tended to take a lukewarm stance toward social reforms during the New Deal because they were preoccupied with securing the right to organize. At the start of the decade, fewer than 3 million American workers were organized (which was 2 million fewer than in 1920), and most were skilled workers in various American Federation of Labor (AFL) craft unions. In the early 1930s, considerable unrest developed among assembly-line workers and miners under the leadership of men such as John L. Lewis, who headed the United Mine Workers. But the AFL eyed these unskilled workers nervously because they were unlikely candidates for skilled electrical, carpentry, and other unions. Prompted by worker unrest, and sensing that the New Deal provided workers with a less hostile environment than they had encountered under prior administrations, Lewis impatiently prodded the AFL to allocate resources to unions of unskilled workers. In 1936, giving up on the AFL, he formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which finally provided a home for steel, auto, mining, and other unions. But the bloody strikes and the sheer effort of organizing these unions meant that Lewis and others devoted limited effort to securing broader social reforms for American workers. Indeed, in roughly one-half of the strikes during the New Deal, the goal was to obtain the right to form a union rather than to secure higher wages. * By 1936, labor had become the major single contributor to the campaigns of Roosevelt, but labor was uncertain in its support for some New Deal legislation and was hampered by internal dissension. * The AFL maintained a relatively conservative posture throughout the decade, sometimes even arguing that government work programs represented forced labor even as it often fought opportunistically to obtain jobs in government programs for its own members. It rarely initiated policy ideas and even feared the development of government policies that might facilitate the organizing of unskilled workers by rival unions in automobile, steel, and other plants. * The specter of adverse rulings by the Supreme Court hung over the New Deal from the outset. The court had declared federal child labor legislation to be unconstitutional in 1918, on the grounds that the federal government’s power to regulate interstate commerce was not applicable in that case. In the New Deal era, four of the justices, known as the four horsemen, consistently opposed federal social legislation on the grounds that it was not an enumerated power in the Constitution; when joined by two moderate justices, they were able to overrule social legislation. (Only three relatively liberal justices were on the court. * ) The United States also lacked fiscal and government institutions to implement sweeping reforms. The federal income tax was initiated in 1913, but taxes had been drastically cut during the 1920s and only modestly increased by the Federal Revenue Act of 1932; less than 5% of Americans paid a federal income tax even after this legislation. The government financed social welfare programs by running deficits in its budget, but many Americans, including some of Roosevelt’s advisors, believed that deficits exacerbated the economic problems of the nation. * A federal civil service system was in place, but federal bureaucracies were relatively small in 1932 and riddled with patronage and corruption. When Frances Perkins was appointed secretary of labor, for example, she found that many of its top officials were receiving payoffs in return for obtaining immigration papers and visas for political supporters; they were hoping she would stay away from her office so that they could continue to receive these payoffs. * Local government institutions were even more archaic. Many public welfare offices, for example, were staffed by cronies of local politicians; welfare funds often found their way into the pockets of politicians; and punitive policies, such as publicizing the names of recipients, were used in some jurisdictions. * Legislatures at national and local levels and even the presidency itself were unpromising vehicles for social reform. Many state legislatures met only every two years and busied themselves primarily with pork barrel and patronage matters. Congress was saddled with a seniority system that rewarded older, Southern, and conservative legislators who chaired key committees. Committees generally lacked staffs to help them analyze legislation and develop positions. Patronage was frequently entangled with policy; when legislators or presidents broached policy recommendations, it was often assumed that their major motivation was to secure patronage jobs for loyal supporters. * The institution of the presidency was unequipped to develop policy. The presidency had become a symbolic post during the 1920s, when presidents satisfied themselves with budget-balancing and patronage functions. Roosevelt dramatically changed the presidency from a symbolic institution to a policy-initiating institution in his first year, when he presented a full legislative package to Congress. * Another factor that slowed the pace of reform was the absence of a well- developed radical movement in the United States such as existed in the stronger union and socialist movements in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s. When a challenge from the left did develop in 1934 and 1935 (which we shall discuss later), it was poorly organized and focused primarily on the personal agendas of charismatic leaders. * Local organizations of unemployed persons sprang up spontaneously in many localities, but their national impact was limited because they were not nationally coordinated, and their emphasis was on obtaining higher benefits from existing work and relief programs. * Local agricultural protest movements flourished but also focused on improving the benefits provided by existing programs, as well as on the implementation of policies to stem the tide of foreclosures. No alliances formed between groups that represented urban workers and distressed persons in rural areas; indeed, many farmers turned against the New Deal in the late 1930s because they resented its emphasis on urban reforms. * Reform momentum was also impeded by dissension among Roosevelt’s advisors, some of whom favored conservative policies. The inner circle of advisors included budget-conscious persons, such as Henry Morgenthau (secretary of the treasury) and Lewis Douglas (director of the Bureau of the Budget), who sought to reduce social spending and often contended with Harry Hopkins (Roosevelt’s most powerful social welfare advisor), who favored increasing social spending, even when it required massive deficits. Some advisors, such as Frances Perkins, sought federal policies that ceded major policy roles to the states, in contrast to advisors like Harry Hopkins, who tended to favor federal policy roles. Louis Brandeis, the attorney general, believed that a trust-busting strategy should be used, whereas Senator Robert Wagner, a key ally of Roosevelt, believed trust-busting hurt economic growth. Roosevelt often received contradictory advice and was himself confused about various issues, such as the merits of deficit spending. * We have mentioned, as well, that Roosevelt was not a radical. He did not favor the ongoing assumption of major welfare programs by the federal government; he liked social insurance programs that were funded by payroll deductions rather than from general revenues; and he often acceded to advisors who advocated cuts in social programs to decrease federal deficits. * Finally, Southern Democrats chaired the major committees of Congress and constituted a substantial voting bloc in the Democratic Party. Throughout the decade, Roosevelt realized that his social reforms could be enacted only if he kept the support of these conservative legislators, who might otherwise form a majority of the chamber if they voted with Republicans. Battling for Resources as a Prelude to Reform Roosevelt’s greatest challenge in developing social reforms to help millions of unemployed persons was to find resources to fund them. He knew that he could not easily raise taxes in a nation that disliked them. He knew that even the revenues from the small federal taxes had been halved to only $2 billion by the Great Depression as businesses went bankrupt and as the taxable income of citizens dwindled. He knew that the federal government already faced a deficit from the Hoover presidency—and that many Americans opposed increasing this deficit even to help destitute people. And he knew that no precedent existed in the United States for lar ge peacetime spending in a nation whose federal budget totaled only $4.2 billion in 1933 or merely 10.8% of the gross national product (GNP) compared with more than 20% in contemporary America. So Roosevelt developed a clever strategy to disguise his intention to increase federal spending and to diminish political opposition to vast new expenditures once he launched the New Deal. He only vaguely suggested he might have to increase spending to relieve “starvation and dire suffering” during his campaign in 1932. Drawing upon the advice of an advisor , he segregated “emergency spending” from the “regular” or ordinary budget of the government soon after he took office. (If the emergency budget would consist of spending to relieve the suffering of unemployed people, the regular budget funded the ongoing costs of government, such as the War Department and the Post Of fice.) If the emergency budget would be funded by government borrowing through the sale of bonds to investors, the regular budget would be funded by tax revenues. This division of government finances into two budgets allowed Roosevelt to promise simultaneously to balance the (regular) budget while seeking billions of dollars of funds for federal relief and work relief programs throughout the 1930s in the second (emergency) budget. Roosevelt did balance the regular budget by periodically cutting the spending of programs funded by it—often boasting to conservatives who opposed his “big spending” that he was a fiscal conservative. At the same time, he more than doubled spending of the federal government by expanding his emergency budget that was funded by the sale of bonds outside the regular budget process. It was a politically ingenious strategy. When conservatives complained that he was spending excessively, he would cut spending in the regular budget, usually balancing it by cutting spending on veterans’ programs, slashing the number of federal employees, cutting the War Department, and achieving many additional economies—while simultaneously incurring huge deficits to fund the emergency budget by selling bonds. Yet he frequently obtained funds for the emergency budget that funded New Deal programs—an emergency budget that usually exceeded the size of the regular budget. The New Deal was, in short, financed by borrowing and deficits, more than doubling the size of the annual federal budget from $4 billion to roughly $8 billion. If only 20% of the federal budget had been devoted to social programs when Roosevelt took office, more than 50% was devoted to work relief and economic relief programs from 1934 through 1939. Even as they complained about Roosevelt’s unprecedented spending, conservatives were poorly positioned to attack it because huge numbers of their constituents were unemployed and needed assistance from New Deal programs. They often voted almost unanimously to approve the sale of bonds to finance the emergency budget. Using the Funds to Finance Emergency Relief Having solved the problem of resources, Roosevelt immediately created unprecedented social programs to address “dire suffering” as he had promised during his campaign of 1932. He began creating the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) in early 1933 to address the plight of many states and localities that verged on bankruptcy because of mounting welfare costs and diminished revenues. It provided funds to states for persons who needed financial assistance and was virtually a carbon copy, though on a larger scale, of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration (TERA) that Roosevelt had developed in New York. * The legislation did not give a carte blanche to state and local governments. Hopkins, who was placed in charge of the FERA by Roosevelt, was a man of strong convictions who realized that Poor Law traditions in states and localities were often punitive, particularly to persons capable of working— the very group that now made up the bulk of the population that needed welfare. He was also incensed by the orientations of many private agencies, which insisted on intensive casework screening of applicants as a condition of relief at a time when tens of millions of Americans were unemployed through no fault of their own. Hopkins did not hold the widespread belief that the poor should receive in-kind relief or food vouchers to prevent them from spending welfare funds on alcohol, tobacco, and other luxuries. If wealthy persons can drink martinis, he asked, why not allow poor persons to drink beer? Hopkins also realized that firm federal administration of relief giving would be needed if corruption and patronage were to be avoided. He did not want intensive case work to be used with recipients, but he wanted trained social workers to be hired in supervisory positions, so as to enhance the professionalism of welfare services and provide services to those who needed them. * The subsequent legislation, which evolved in the course of consultations between Hopkins, Perkins, Senator Robert Wagner, and Roosevelt, contained provisions to minimize these various dangers. It required each state to designate a state commission that was separate from the existing welfare apparatus, both to underscore the temporary nature of the federal assistance and to establish new agencies that would not be punitive. The state commissions were required to establish offices in the various counties and to establish uniform eligibility processes to be used throughout the state. Federal officials had veto power over high-level appointments, to guard against patronage appointments, and required the use of social workers in key supervisory positions. The legislation gave federal authorities the right to federalize FERA programs in states where irregularities such as corruption or excessive patronage were discovered. It authorized $500 million in federal aid to destitute persons, of which half was given to states in a one-to-three match; the other $250 million was used as grants to states that could prove they lacked funds. The FERA was technically supposed to provide welfare payments only for unemployed persons, but many states also gave funds to the working poor, many of whom were unable to survive on their low wages. Its major thrust was to help states and localities with the costs of sustaining unemployed persons, but the FERA also funded and ran camps for transients, helped college students with loans, funded cooperatives among farmers, and purchased more than 1 million acres of land for resale to tenant farmers. * The FERA was a startling departure from prior American welfare traditions. It represented the first major federal welfare program in the nation’s history. The country was divided into five regions, whose federal administrators worked closely with directors of state emergency relief organizations to ensure that federal guidelines were followed. They were often greeted with hostility by local and state officials, who resented federal intrusion and sought to maintain patronage systems and punitive practices. The regional and federal administrators were not afraid to persevere to correct local abuses; indeed, they federalized FERA operations in six states because of irregularities. * Although the FERA was innovative, it also had conservative features. Convinced that public welfare rightly belonged to states and local jurisdictions and that the depression would quickly end, Roosevelt hoped to terminate the FERA. (Note how he placed the word emergency in its title.) The legislation did not require local units of government to give recipients a minimum level of benefits because this policy would have been widely interpreted as undue interference with local prerogatives. Although federal authorities expected local government to use FERA funds to supplement their existing welfare expenditures, many cut their local funding, so that welfare recipients scarcely benefited from the infusion of new federal money. * Some local governments continued to give in-kind benefits—and residents of some states refused to enact state bond issues needed to raise local matching funds so that federal funding was terminated for brief periods that were called “food-less holidays.” The federal government instituted a range of food programs during the Great Depression, even though Hopkins and others preferred cash assistance to in-kind assistance. These included a Food Stamp Program for federal workers who could show evidence of need and a massive surplus commodities program that distributed agricultural produce to the nation’s poor. * Moving from Cash Assistance to Creating W ork Programs Critics pointed out that the FERA mostly provided funds instead of trying to find jobs for unemployed persons. Some observers even suspected that, by allowing states to provide FERA funds to people who were working but still poor, the program encouraged employers to reduce wages. Accepting those criticisms of the program, Hopkins himself argued in the summer of 1933 that the FERA dole was holding back large numbers of persons who were able and willing to work. * Moreover, Roosevelt and Hopkins realized that work relief would be far more politically popular in a nation with a poorhouse tradition that had always been averse to providing cash assistance to nonworking persons. To create a work relief program, Aubrey Williams, an assistant to Hopkins, proposed the use of FERA funds to create public works to be administered through county offices of the FERA in the various states. Its work projects would be developed by local FERA staff in consultation with local government officials. Roosevelt, who also disliked the use of doles for the able-bodied poor, quickly concurred with Williams’s scheme by creating, through executive order, the Civilian Works Administration (CWA) as part of the FERA in 1933. CWA funds came from the FERA budget, as well as surplus funds commandeered from the PWA program. Between November of 1933 and January of 1934, the federal government initiated 190,000 work projects that employed 16 million Americans—a remarkable feat by any standard, even though the CWA still did not reach most unemployed persons. The program was funded by a federal–local matching formula, in which the federal government paid most of the direct costs. Most work projects were proposed by local officials, who submitted tens of thousands of ideas, not only because they wanted to help the unemployed but also because an enormous backlog of road repair and other public needs existed in bankrupted local jurisdictions. The projects were approved by local officials and state FERA officials, except for those that were initiated by federal staff and approved in the Washington headquarters of the FERA. Road-related construction projects accounted for 8% of CWA funds; other local improvement projects under the program included recataloging books in public libraries, constructing retaining walls, digging drainage ditches, and cleaning local parks. * Many practical eligibility and reimbursement details had to be quickly solved to allow these projects to be implemented in 1933 and 1934. Hopkins angered unemployed persons who were not on FERA rolls when he decided to require that 50% of the enrollees come from FERA relief rolls, but he remained adamant because he felt welfare recipients should receive priority. (He also feared that unions, which saw the program as a chance to obtain employment for unemployed union workers, would dominate the recruitment process and insist that virtually all jobs go to their members, to the detriment of FERA recipients.) State employment offices certified that CWA workers were unemployed and had tried to find jobs in the private sector. Reimbursement levels were established in Washington that gave workers in jobs that were classified as unskilled far less pay than ones classed as skilled positions—and adjustments were made to reflect regional wage and cost-of-living levels. (Hopkins succeeded in allocating most of the job slots to unskilled persons so that the program would not be monopolized by skilled workers.) CWA wage levels were hardly munificent; indeed, workers with relatively large families often had to supplement their CWA paychecks with FERA assistance to survive. Roosevelt also had to contend both with Republicans’ fears that the CWA would be used for patronage purposes by his administration and with Democratic officials who wanted to reward party members with jobs. Determined not to appease those Democrats who desired patronage, Roosevelt insisted that the federal FERA staff carefully screen the thousands of applicants for project supervisor positions and reject persons who lacked requisite skills, even when they were nominees of Democrats. Given the size of the operation (it involved 190,000 separate projects) and the speed of its implementation, it is remarkable that only 240 charges of serious irregularity were ever proved. * The CWA was a bold initiative that gave new social welfare roles to the federal government. It was a massive program, even by today’s standards, but was nonetheless an emergency measure that gave minimal benefits to destitute persons and reimbursed unskilled labor at significantly lower levels than skilled labor. Even before he was elected, Roosevelt had promised to enact a scheme that would address unemployment among the nation’s youth by devising conservation projects in national and state parks. No reform measure was more popular during the New Deal than the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which was enacted in 1933 and provided assistance to 2.5 million young men. (See Figure 6.2 .) Its popularity stemmed from its assistance to youth; from its conservation projects, which were often located in the districts of conservative legislators who might normally have opposed the program; and from its reduction of welfare rolls. Figure 6.2. AP Images CCC workers in the Great Depression. Eligibility was restricted at first to males between the ages of 18 and 25 who were currently on welfare rolls, but by 1937, in response to widespread protest against this restrictive eligibility policy, officials allowed any unemployed youth to apply. To spread CCC benefits to as many youths as possible, Roosevelt tried to limit enrollees to 1 year’s residence but then allowed youths to extend their stay for another year because of their difficulty in finding jobs in the private economy. Recruits were paid as little as $1 a day and required to send half their wages to their parents. The army and the Department of Interior jointly administered the CCC, with the Army administering the camps under a strict regimen supervised by sergeants, while the Department of Interior planned and oversaw the work projects in the national and state forests to which the youths were sent each day in small work groups. It would be hard to overestimate the meaning of the CCC to unemployed youths. Because the unemployment rate among youths was often double the rate for adults, many young persons would have been consigned to welfare for years had the CCC not existed. Transported great distances from Midwestern and Eastern cities to parks in the West, the participants underwent an extraordinary and broadening experience. The program was implemented with remarkable speed; 300,000 youths were placed in camps by the summer of 1933 and 500,000 by 1934. Nevertheless, the program was not perfect. Critics feared that the CCC was militarizing America’s youth by placing them in regimented settings under the control of the army. Others noted that the CCC did not prepare the youths for jobs after they had left the CCC, did not provide technical skills, did not emphasize remedial education, and did not offer employment counseling. The program was not large enough to meet the needs of the vast numbers of youth who needed jobs during the Great Depression. It also placed African American youths in segregated camps and did not address the needs of young women. * Developing a W ork Relief Program for Complex Projects The CWA and CCC focused on work projects that could be speedily implemented and that emphasized unskilled labor, so they could not construct relatively complex projects that were needed to make internal improvements in the United States—for example, to address such natural disasters as floods and droughts or to build airports, roads, bridges, and military installations. Work on these projects, Roosevelt contended, served both the public interest and the needs of unemployed Americans. Accordingly, he developed the Public Works Administration (PWA) in 1933. Because large-scale projects can easily become enmeshed in corruption and patronage, Roosevelt appointed Harold Ickes to be its director. Ickes was a stern perfectionist who insisted on the highest technical standards. His administrative style and philosophy contrasted with the free-wheeling Harry Hopkins. Ickes believed that the hurriedly arranged projects of the CWA did not provide lasting economic benefit to the nation —and he was furious when Hopkins was able, repeatedly, to raid PWA funds for the CWA and its successor, the Works Progress Administration (WPA). * Ickes subjected each project to an identical—and lengthy—review process that made extensive use of engineers and other experts to convince legislators that projects were funded on their merits. He took care to assemble a skilled workforce, project managers, and contractors who could build a project to precise specifications. Because he distrusted corporations, which he regarded as placing profits ahead of the public interest, he contracted projects to the private sector only with reluctance and monitored them carefully. As the first massive peacetime involvement by the federal government in complex public projects, the PWA had constructed by 1937 astonishing numbers of bridges, airports, dams, and school buildings. It had to surmount politics and troublesome lawsuits, as political and community rivals developed alternative projects or even alternative versions of the same project. Because the PWA required local units of government to contribute a large share of the cost of specific projects, many projects had to be canceled when local funds were not forthcoming. The PWA also had to overcome opposition from conservatives who questioned whether the federal government was competing with private business and thus overstepping its proper role. * Prior to 1933, only 23 states had developed employment offices to help unemployed workers find jobs. But with the passage of the Wagner-Peyser Act in 1933, federal funds were made available to the states for that purpose, creating a national network of state employment offices. As well as helping unemployed workers find jobs, these offices were used extensively to recruit and screen persons for work in the CWA, CCC, and PWA. * Trying to End the Great Depression Itself Increasing Federal Spending The FERA, CWA, CCC, and PWA rescued persons for brief periods from economic misery, but they did not directly address the collapse of the economic system itself, which had created the economic misery in the first place. Because the trickle-down theories of Herbert Hoover had not worked, Roosevelt proposed a combination of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and market support strategies. Indeed, Rosen argues that Roosevelt valued these economic policies even more than his welfare and jobs programs. * Hoover had feared federal deficits, but Roosevelt drastically increased social spending and produced unprecedented peacetime deficits that were funded by selling tens of millions of dollars of federal bonds. Innovative as this policy was, Roosevelt and his aides did not understand that far more drastic increases in social spending would have been a potent economic weapon against the depression because of widespread revulsion against deficits. * (Aggregate federal spending in the New Deal amounted to only 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) as compared to federal spending of 20% of GDP during the 1950s and subsequent decades. Federal spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security alone made up almost 10% of GDP in 2008.) Roosevelt’s deficits were modest, too, compared to those during World War II or those from 1981 onward, save for a brief interlude during the presidency of Bill Clinton. The theories of the English economist John Maynard Keynes, which provided a rationale for incurring large deficits during recessions and depressions, were not widely publicized or accepted in the United States until 1936. * Even had Roosevelt wanted to increase spending on his New Deal by two or three times, he would have met stiff bipartisan resistance from Congress, since the nation had resorted to truly big budgets only during World War I. Restoring Conﬁdence in Banks In another strategy to end the Great Depression, Roosevelt hoped to restore confidence in the nation’s banks. During the 1920s, many banks had insufficient reserves to provide a margin of safety for large numbers of withdrawals by account holders or to cover bad loans and investments—as happened in 1929 when the Great Depression began. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, established in 1933, provided federal insurance to cover deposits when banks became insolvent. Attacking Speculation in Stocks Roosevelt also tried to prevent another catastrophic depression by placing restrictions on stock trading so that investors could not rely excessively on credit when investing in stocks. He established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1934 to establish regulations to forestall undue speculation by investors and stockbrokers. * Stopping the V icious Circle of Job and Price Cuts in Industry Roosevelt’s most difficult problem, however, was to arrest the vicious circle of economic developments that kept the Great Depression going. As consumers lost their jobs and had their wages cut, the demand for products and goods declined—prompting businesses to cut prices. As they cut prices, however, they had to lay off more employees or curtail production—a strategy that led to even greater inability by consumers to purchase their products—which, in turn, led to further layoffs and wage cuts in an escalating cycle. To interrupt this vicious circle, Roosevelt enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, which established the National Recovery Administration (NRA). It convened business leaders in various economic sectors, such as the steel, coal, and mining industries, to agree on prices they would, together, charge for products in their sectors. By establishing a set price, Roosevelt hoped to stop the cuts in prices that had forced cuts in employment and slashes in wages. To further guarantee that employers would not slash wages, the NRA required business leaders to establish common wage levels for their workers, with regional variations to account for differences in the cost of living. To avert the production of surplus goods that stimulated cuts in prices, the NRA also asked business leaders to establish production quotas for each company. * Critics feared that businesses would use this participatory process to make excessive profits by establishing self-serving policies—whether through excessively low wages, high prices, or low levels of production to drive up prices. Some persons claimed the NRA was unconstitutional because it allowed businesses to use monopolistic practices, such as price and wage fixing, that were forbidden by the Sherman Antitrust Act. To forestall these abuses, the NRA required business leaders to establish prices that were fair, to refrain from using child labor, to allow workers to join unions, to honor specified minimum working conditions, to exclude women from dangerous occupations, and to include union representatives in industry-wide negotiations. Roosevelt tried, in effect, to use the NRA not only to establish a process to stabilize prices and wages but also to advance indirectly the cause of social reform by abolishing child labor and legitimizing unions. * Its goals were ambitious, but the NRA was hampered by many problems. Liberals who argued that the NRA put foxes in charge of the henhouse found their fears realized when some NRA negotiations led to price increases and production cutbacks that decreased employment while adding to the burdens of consumers. Employers who honored the minimum wage requirements of the NRA often worked their employees to exhaustion to recoup wage increases, whereas others resorted to a policy of labor turnover to reduce their labor costs. Many employers ignored provisions of the NRA by 1934, when they became convinced that it was unconstitutional. * Businesses also found ways of harming labor. Because the provisions that allowed workers to organize unions were exceedingly vague, many employers formed company unions to thwart the establishment of independent unions and then told the NRA that their workers were already organized. General Hugh Johnson, the director of the NRA, took an aggressive stance in opposing efforts to form longshoremen’s unions in California and even urged the use of federal troops to repress some legitimate unions on the grounds that their organizers were communists. Southern firms often succeeded in keeping extremely low wage levels for jobs held by African Americans by contending that regional wages were lower than in the North. * The NRA was terminated in 1935 when the Supreme Court declared that its delegation of power to business leaders was unconstitutional. However, its demise had been widely predicted because it had not been effective. An elaborate bureaucracy was required to arrange and oversee negotiations in thousands of industries; price and labor codes were established in virtually every industry—including, for example, firms that made fishhooks. Because federal administrators could not effectively monitor so many codes, companies’ compliance was far from perfect. Finally, the National Labor Board, which was established to monitor the provisions protecting workers who sought unionization, had too few staff and too little power to help most workers. Stopping the V icious Circle of Price Cuts and Increased Production in Agriculture Roosevelt similarly tried to stop the vicious circle of prices and employment in the agricultural sector. As the demand for agricultural products declined as consumers were unable to purchase as many of them due to unemployment or slashed wages, farmers would cut the prices of their goods—which drove millions of them toward bankruptcy. Moreover, many of them would try to grow more crops so they could sell more products that would offset the lower prices they received—but the greater acreage of production would further depress prices in a vicious circle. To address this agricultural depression, Roosevelt established the Agricultural Adjustment Agency (AAA), which was financed by levying a tax on food processors. * The AAA convened producers of each of the major crops, such as cotton and corn, to negotiate the amounts of acreage they would grow, and then reimbursed farmers for not planting some of their land to avert the drop in prices for agricultural goods—allowing more farmers to remain solvent. The worst casualties of the agricultural depression were tenant farmers and sharecroppers. They were desperately poor—and were often evicted by farmers when their profits decreased. The AAA developed safeguards to forestall abuse of tenant farmers by landowners; but because it lacked the staff to monitor landowners, evictions continued. The AAA required landowners to pass on to tenants a specified percentage of the monies they obtained from the government for withdrawing acreage from production, but many landowners gave sharecroppers a smaller percentage or nothing at all. In 1934, the Southern Tenant Farmers Association was formed to try to stop evictions, but grassroots advocacy was difficult because the tenant farmers and sharecroppers, many of them African Americans in the South, were geographically dispersed and impoverished. * As with the NRA, however, large producers often used the AAA to advance their own financial interests. They established production policies that were favorable to themselves but harmful to small farmers and took their poorest land out of production to avoid having to reduce their overall output. Many of them pocketed their growing profits as the prices of agricultural goods stabilized—and evicted many tenant farmers and sharecroppers. A verting Foreclosures Roosevelt tried to provide assistance to millions of farmers and homeowners threatened with foreclosure. Farm mortgages were directly purchased and refinanced by the government when the Emergency Farm Mortgage Act and the Farm Relief Act were enacted in 1933. In assisting homeowners, the Roosevelt administration decided to take an indirect role; rather than helping homeowners directly, the National Housing Act of 1934 established the Federal Home Administration (FHA) to insure mortgages and home improvement loans, so that banks could refinance them at lower rates of interest and so banks would not become insolvent if consumers could not make their mortgage payments. * Reviving Economies in V ast Regions Why not, some persons asked, use the power of the federal government to orchestrate the economic development of entire regions? With federal assistance, vast river systems in the United States, including the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, could be made to yield power if dams, generators, and transmission lines were constructed. The most prominent legislative advocate of regional development schemes was George Norris, a progressive Republican senator from Nebraska, who had made river development his major interest and who worked closely with Roosevelt to secure its passage. The first project, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), was initiated in 1933 and governed by a commission that was established to oversee development of a network of dams and generating plants. The TVA sold electricity to power cooperatives and nearby towns, manufactured and sold fertilizer, reforested vast amounts of land, and built flood control projects. It was partially responsible for the economic rebirth of a vast region; and thanks to the proceeds from the sale of power and fertilizer, the cost to the government was minimal. Private power companies, which often charged excessive fees for their power, protested vigorously that the federal government was competing unfairly with them. Their many legal and political strategies to sabotage the TVA included attempts to place allies on the commission that established TVA policy. Defenders of the TVA were able to institutionalize the experiment, however, even if they were unable to extend their bold design to the Missouri and other large river systems. * Identify Conservative Pressures on Roosevelt between 1934 and 1936 Events of early 1934 were not encouraging to social reformers. Roosevelt, under severe pressure to cut spending to reduce deficits, terminated the CWA in 1934, despite protests from reformers. * Slowing the momentum of social programs also had a political rationale. Although Roosevelt had won a sweeping victory in 1932, as well as control of both houses of Congress, he feared that widespread grumbling about welfare cheaters and loafers in the FERA, CWA, and PWA would fuel a conservative resurgence in the congressional elections in November of 1934. Many Americans were uneasy about the sudden assumption of major policy roles by the federal government in a nation that had been dominated by state and local governments. Business and conservative interests, which had been on the defensive and in disarray in 1933 and early 1934, had also begun to develop a political counteroffensive—accusing Roosevelt of seeking to build a political dynasty by using New Deal programs for Democrats. Moreover, Roosevelt had his own doubts about the advisability of a strong federal role in public welfare, as he had always favored giving local governments the responsibility for welfare problems. He had developed the FERA because states were verging on bankruptcy in 1932—not because he wanted to institutionalize it. He did not want the federal government to assume a permanent job creation role. He continued to hope that easing of the economic depression would permit a reduction in size of the federal programs, though advisors like Hopkins feared that the government would have to continue to fund public works indefinitely. * It was unclear in the summer of 1934 whether most New Deal reforms would prove enduring or whether they would be rescinded when the Great Depression finally ended. Because such strong forces existed in the 1930s that opposed sweeping social reforms even when the nation was devastated by the worst economic catastrophe in American history, it is interesting to speculate when major federal reforms would have emerged had the Great Depression not occurred (see Insert 6.3 ). Insert 6.3. Critical Analysis: When W ould National Reforms Have Emerged without the Great Depression? Hypotheticals—that is, surmises about the course of history if certain historical incidents had not occurred—are sometimes useful because they force us to analyze history and to place specific developments in a broader perspective. Speculate whether major social programs would have been enacted at the federal level had the Great Depression not occurred. If they would not have been enacted in the 1930s, would other pressures or forces have eventually forced Americans to develop major national social programs? How would we view Franklin Roosevelt had he not presided over the nation during the Great Depression? When Roosevelt won a smashing victory in the congressional elections in November 1934, Harry Hopkins and other social reformers believed they could finally prevail over both Republicans and budget balancers within the Democratic Party. Hopkins said to fellow reformers: Boys, this is our hour. We’ve got to get everything we want—a works program, Social Security, wages and hours [regulation], everything— now or never. Put your minds to work in developing a complete ticket to provide security for all the folks of this country up and down and across the board. * Hopkins proposed the End Poverty in America (EPIA) plan, which included an ongoing federal jobs program, a massive low-cost housing program, a set of insurance programs, establishment of large manufacturing centers, and new rural programs to help poor farmers acquire land and equipment. * Liberals generally supported the New Deal programs; more radical groups and individuals, while endorsing the goals of Roosevelt’s reforms, wanted him to go much further. Huey Long, the charismatic and demagogic senator from Louisiana, pressured Roosevelt to place heavy taxes on incomes and estates of millionaires, to greatly expand federal works programs, and to pay a higher wage to workers in public works projects. He believed that the NRA and the AAA did little more than protect the interests of large industrialists and landowners. He criticized the low wages paid by the CWA and attacked the budget-cutting inclinations of Roosevelt. As a militant defender of small farmers and small businessmen, he believed that their economic opportunities remained limited, he resented affluent elites, and he tended to dislike the large New Deal bureaucracies. * Father Charles Coughlin, a Jesuit priest from Detroit, attracted a massive audience to his national radio show when he proposed a variety of federal regulations of the banking system and monetary reforms. His initial support for Roosevelt turned to opposition when FDR failed to support his economic measures. * (Coughlin later turned sharply to the right and became virulently anti-Semitic.) Other reformers concentrated on single issues. Francis Townsend, a dentist in Long Beach, California, proposed and popularized a scheme to pay a monthly pension of $200 per month to all American citizens over the age of 60 on the condition that they pledge to spend it within 30 days and agree to give up all other income. It was to be financed from a federal sales tax. He hoped the scheme would simultaneously relieve grinding poverty among the elderly and revive the economy by requiring them to spend their monthly pensions before the end of each month. He obtained 20 million signatures on a petition by 1936. * Representative Ernest Lundeen of Minnesota proposed a scheme of unemployment insurance in 1934 to pay compensation from the general revenues of the nation to all persons who were unemployed through no fault of their own. (Unemployed workers were to receive benefits equal to prevailing wages, and persons with part-time work were to have their wages supplemented to bring them up to the prevailing standard.) The scheme was to be administered by workers’ and farmers’ organizations. * A bipartisan cadre of liberals often voted together on public housing legislation, legislation protecting the rights of unions, legislation to oppose lynching of African Americans, and fair labor standards. Senator Robert F. Wagner, a leading figure in this liberal bloc, initiated reform measures without FDR’s approval as a means of pressuring the administration to be more daring. * Roosevelt experienced mounting pressure from reformers and social workers. An influential contingent of social workers from New York State had assumed a particularly important role in supporting reforms during the early years of the New Deal when they offered suggestions and assumed key positions within the administration. (Hopkins and Perkins were merely the most visible members of this community.) * Many of them had become disenchanted with the New Deal by 1934, however. They resented the termination of the CWA, the opportunistic exploitation of the NRA by many businessmen, and the low levels of relief provided by the FERA and the CWA. Their anger mounted during 1935, when they believed Roosevelt hoped to discontinue federal assistance to many unemployed persons and destitute families. A radical contingent of the social work profession, led by Mary van Kleeck, urged social workers to become radical critics of the New Deal rather than be coopted by Roosevelt. * Pressure for reform also came from the burgeoning unions that represented unskilled workers. These workers and their organizers had been radicalized by the inhumane labor practices of the corporations, high rates of unemployment among unskilled workers, and the bloody suppression of strikes in automobile and steel plants and in coal mines. Union leaders such as Walter Reuther in the auto industry and John L. Lewis in mining developed growing constituencies and power. Although they had supported the establishment of the NRA because of its protections for unions, they wondered why the Roosevelt administration seemed content with the vague and poorly enforced provisions of the NRA to protect collective bargaining. * In 1934, the Southern Tenant Farmers Association (STFA) was formed to protect millions of agricultural laborers who found their lot even worse after passage of the AAA. A few African American sharecroppers were helped by the FERA and the Resettlement Administration to obtain their own land, but most remained enmeshed in poverty and heavily indebted to landowners who charged them excessive prices for seed, fertilizer, and food. To make matters worse, as landowners curbed production to reap payments from the AAA, they evicted their tenant farmers. The STFA asked the administration to stop this wave of evictions and to help landless persons obtain their own farms. * Although workers, liberals, and African Americans were often critical of Roosevelt, they nonetheless regarded him as preferable to Republican leaders, who became even more conservative and opposed to reform after the 1934 election. This support from the left emboldened Roosevelt to initiate and support reforms, not only because he wanted to keep their support but also because he wanted to prevent the emergence of a more radical rival. A poll in 1935 suggested that Huey Long would receive 6 million votes if he were to run for president in 1936—possibly drawing enough votes from Roosevelt to give a Republican candidate a chance to beat Roosevelt. * Father Coughlin and Townsend supported the Union Party, which frontally attacked Roosevelt as too conservative and sought to defeat both the Democrats and Republicans in the elections of 1936. Rivalry among leaders and groups on the left, the assassination of Huey Long in 1935, and Roosevelt’s sheer popularity and tactical brilliance doomed the political aspirations of many of these leaders, but they pushed Roosevelt to consider policies that he might otherwise have neglected. * A determined group of social reformers, including Isaac Rubinow, pressured Roosevelt and his aides to enact old age pensions, unemployment insurance, and national health insurance. Some of them had sought such legislation in the Progressive Era—and had continued their work during the 1920s by advocating so-called social insurances in various states. Although they differed over program details, these reformers were convinced that economic security would never be realized in the United States if these reforms were not enacted. Identify Pivotal New Deal V ictories: 1934–1936 EP 5a EP 5b Despite the conservative pressures on Roosevelt, the New Deal reached its zenith of success in 1935 and 1936 with enactment of the Social Security Act, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the Works Progress Administration (WPA), and the National Youth Administration (NYA); but the form and size of these initiatives often reflected compromises with conservatives. LO 6-6 The Social Security Act The Social Security Act, which is the foundation of the American welfare state, contained many programs to address a variety of social problems. Roosevelt wanted to decide, once and for all, which relief functions would be maintained by federal and local governments. He also wanted to prevent destitution by developing social insurances to address the economic needs of persons who were unemployed and elderly. Finally, he wanted to develop some permanent and ongoing programs to constitute his legacy to the nation. Roosevelt had many policy interests, but he wanted a single piece of legislation to encapsulate them, because he realized that some relatively controversial measures, such as unemployment insurance, would not pass unless they were part of a larger piece of legislation that also contained more popular programs such as old age pensions and welfare assistance for older persons. He reasoned as well that the Supreme Court would find it more difficult to attack specific programs if they were part of multi-faceted legislation. (See Figure 6.3 .) Figure 6.3. National Park Service Franklin Delano Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act. To plan this legislation, Roosevelt appointed a Committee on Economic Security in June of 1934. The committee, chaired by Frances Perkins, included the secretary of the treasury, the attorney general, the secretary of agriculture, and the administrator of the FERA. A large advisory committee and a technical committee were also formed. The committee accomplished its complex task with remarkable speed and was able, after marathon sessions during the Christmas holidays, to issue its final report on January 15, 1935. The legislation passed overwhelmingly in the Congress and was signed into law by Roosevelt in August 1935. The Social Security Act contained two social insurance programs, three relief programs, and other smaller programs. * Social insurances, principally unemployment insurance and old age pensions (Social Security), were attractive to Roosevelt for several reasons. They were self-funding programs; their benefits were financed from payroll taxes levied on employers and employees. Roosevelt favored the payroll tax so that future generations would not have to fund these programs from general revenues. He also believed that these insurance programs would reduce the size of welfare rolls, as the benefits paid to older persons and unemployed workers in these programs lifted them above the threshold of poverty. Moreover, he knew that insurances were politically acceptable to many Americans because they represented earned benefits rather than welfare payments. * Roosevelt initially showed little interest in Social Security because he was preoccupied with the needs of unemployed workers, but he vigorously declared his support of it when critical stories appeared in the press in 1934. * Despite the political popularity of these programs, Roosevelt believed he needed to make concessions to conservatives to ensure their passage. Over the protests of some liberals, he supported a regressive system of payroll taxes that levied stiffer taxes of Social Security on low-income wage earners than on more affluent persons, and he refused to contribute general revenues to Social Security. (Liberals believed the use of general revenues would have been more equitable and would have allowed major increases in the size of benefits.) Some liberals also opposed his decision—supported by Southern agricultural interests—to exclude farm and domestic workers from both unemployment and Social Security benefits. * Although Roosevelt made concessions to conservatives, he also made policy choices that defied them. Some persons believed that participation in Social Security should be voluntary, but FDR insisted on mandatory participation. Frances Perkins, a believer in states’ rights, initially favored allowing each state to keep its own Social Security fund, but FDR rejected this policy on the grounds that movement of workers between states would make it unworkable. * Originally conceived as a measure to provide pensions to retired workers, Social Security was broadened in 1939 to include family members of the worker. Arthur Altmeyer, chair of the Social Security Board, explained that “this system, formerly a plan to provide old-age annuities for individual wage earners, has become a broad system of family insurance, which protects not only the wage earner but his wife and children, and if they are dependent on him, his aged parents.” * Social Security was amended to include benefits to the wives, widows, and children of retirees—a salutary step even if it was grounded in a patriarchal notion of the family, in which men were regarded as breadwinners and it was assumed that women would not work. * Senator Wagner and other liberals had introduced various versions of a federal unemployment insurance program since 1933, but much controversy existed about how best to proceed. Should funds collected by a payroll tax on employers be kept in a central pool in Washington or in each of the states? Should a general fund be established, or should separate accounts be maintained for each industry? Should the federal government take the lead in administering the funds, devise the level and duration of unemployment benefits, and levy taxes? Should employers’ participation in the scheme be mandatory or voluntary? The unemployment insurance program embodied in the Social Security Act represented an ingenious compromise between these policy alternatives. A payroll tax was levied on employers by states; participation was technically voluntary, but participating employers were given generous federal tax credits to offset most of their payroll taxes. States collected the payroll taxes, but they gave the revenues to the federal government, which maintained a central fund for each state that was then used to pay unemployment benefits to workers. The federal government paid the states’ costs of administering their programs. Although this plan sounds complicated, it was a rather simple scheme to allow the federal government to bear most of the costs of unemployment insurance while lending the appearance that participation by employers was voluntary. * Each state enacted its own unemployment insurance law that specified benefit levels and duration. Many liberal critics contended that the legislation penalized states with high levels of unemployment, whose funds would be more severely burdened than states with low levels of unemployment. Others feared that conservative states might choose to pay low benefits to unemployed persons. Why, some liberal critics asked, should workers have to be unemployed for four weeks before obtaining benefits? Many liberals favored federal contributions to the program to enable it to pay higher benefits for longer periods. They feared that workers would be forced onto welfare rolls because they could not survive on the meager assistance, which was limited to about 14 weeks in many states. Liberals were also unhappy that Roosevelt had capitulated to special interests when he excluded domestics, cannery workers, and farm laborers from coverage. They were nonetheless delighted that FDR supported the concept of unemployment insurance and that he had withstood pressure from conservatives for each state to have its separate unemployment program. * Most liberals supported the Federal Emergency Relief Administration because it gave relief to a broad range of needy Americans—including families, single persons, older persons, and nonworking and working poor persons—and they were furious when it became apparent that Roosevelt had decided to scuttle the FERA and replace it with federal relief programs to only three groups of persons in need—elderly persons (Old Age Assistance, or OAA), children in families with one caretaker (Aid to Dependent Children, or ADC), and blind persons (Aid to the Blind, or AB). * All other destitute persons, including single nonelderly persons and families with two parents, were returned to local or general assistance welfare programs, which were entirely funded by state and local resources. Many of these poor relief agencies were punitive in orientation and racist in their practices. These three programs followed a similar format. States received matching or formula funds from the federal government. Under OAA, for example, the federal government paid one-half of local grants for each eligible person, as long as local grants did not exceed $30 per month. (The federal government paid only one-third of ADC grants.) Federal authorities insisted that a state agency be designated to implement the programs, that uniform standards of eligibility be established within each state to preclude specific counties from developing relatively punitive policies, and that fair hearings be established so that aggrieved recipients could appeal eligibility decisions. * Liberal critics were pleased that Roosevelt had developed some permanent programs, but they were displeased that many persons were shunted to local welfare programs. They contended that the legislation gave states undue power to establish eligibility standards and levels of benefits. Would not Southern and relatively conservative states, they asked, make their programs so restrictive that they would deny assistance to vast numbers of poor persons and people of color? As federal authorities were given no power over the states’ personnel decisions and were not required to use social workers in supervisory positions, critics wondered if patronage would dominate local agencies. * Some liberals were also unhappy that the ADC program restricted assistance to families with a single parent or that the welfare grants to these families included funds only for the children and not for the parent. The policy limiting the grants to children was not amended until 1950, when the name of the program was changed to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). Even this restrictive program was more liberal than a version advocated by some social workers, who wanted relief to be given only to those children who were found, on casework investigation, to reside in “suitable homes,” on the grounds that many destitute mothers provided improper care. * As liberals had predicted, eligibility standards and grant levels were far more restrictive in Southern and rural states than in industrial states, and Southerners kept benefits low, partly to force African American women and their children to labor for miserable wages in cotton and tobacco fields, and partly because Southern states lacked the tax revenues to fund more munificent programs. * Roosevelt confronted important ethical issues when he gave so much power to the states in the ADC program (see Insert 6.4 ). Insert 6.4. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: Federal Leadership versus Deferring to the States The central innovation of the New Deal was its development of the federal government’s social policy roles. States and localities were the prime movers in social policy before the New Deal, as our discussion in Chapters 3 , 4 and 5 suggests. 1. Using the New Deal as an example, analyze the ethics of FDR’s decision to make assertive use of federal power. What ethical criticisms would he have encountered had he not developed national programs in the Great Depression such as the CWA, PWA, TVA, unemployment insurance, and Social Security pensions? Consider the fiscal resources of the federal government (e.g., its tax and borrowing powers) when compared with state governments, particularly during the Great Depression, when many states verged on bankruptcy and lacked the ability to issue and sell bonds on the magnitude used by Roosevelt to fund his emergency budget. Consider, as well, some other reasons why states often cannot or will not develop social policies, such as state officials’ fears that corporations will relocate if state taxes are raised to pay for social programs or the bias against urban areas in many state legislatures. 2. Discuss whether Roosevelt gave states too much power in ADC, OAA, and AB. Keep in mind that Southern Democrats, a key part of Roosevelt’s coalition, adamantly insisted that states have considerable powers, partly because they did not want many African Americans to get welfare rather than to work for starvation wages on large Southern farms. 3. Fast-forward to the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009. Were states able to fund the unemployment, education, and welfare costs linked to this economic downturn—or was President Obama’s stimulus bill necessary to help them fund them? Limited as they were, OAA, ADC, and AB were the first permanent and major federal relief programs. Many persons believed in 1935 that these programs would be extremely small. Social Security benefits, it was thought, would allow elderly persons to escape the OAA program; ADC did not attract much attention as most people thought it would be a federal– state version of mothers’ pension programs; and AB applied only to a relatively small population of persons with a specific disability. * Had they guessed the future size of OAA and ADC rolls or realized that Aid to the Blind would be expanded in the 1950s and subsequent decades to include persons with mental and physical disabilities, many conservatives—and possibly Roosevelt himself—might have thought twice about establishing these federal programs. Reformers were able to obtain provisions in the Social Security Act that provided grants to localities for child welfare and maternal health programs (Title V) and public health programs (Title VI). The amounts of money involved were small; $1.5 million was authorized for the child welfare funds, but the money was allowed to be used only for the administrative costs of state agencies. These small grant programs nonetheless represented grudging acceptance of the notion that local governments needed federal assistance in providing a range of social welfare services. Not until the 1960s were federal programs enacted to fund a range of mental health, health, and other services. The Social Security Act created programs that would have been unthinkable five years earlier. (See Table 6.2 for a summary of its major provisions.) It committed the federal government to permanently fund an assortment of programs. However, many concessions were made to Southern Democrats and other conservatives in the specific programs, and many programs were missing from the legislation altogether. Roosevelt had contemplated including national health programs in the act, but he changed his mind because he feared that opposition from the American Medical Association and conservatives could imperil its passage. A public works program was not placed within the Social Security Act because of the controversy it would have generated. * Table 6.2. Summary of the Major Provisions of the Social Security Act Title I: Grants to States for Old Age Assistance Nature of grants Secretary of treasury pays to each state 50% of the sums expended in a year for assistance to people over age 65 who are not inmates of public institutions , but not including that portion of payments that exceeds $30 per month—and 5% of the federal payments are used to administer the programs by the states . Requirements that states must meet Each state must: have a state plan for old age assistance that is in effect in all political subdivisions of the state and that is mandatory on them pay for the nonfederal share of the costs of assistance designate a single state agency to administer the plan (or supervise the plan if local jurisdictions administer part of it) establish an opportunity for a fair hearing before the state agency for anyone who is denied assistance provide for methods of selecting personnel and administering the grants that are found by the Social Security Board to be necessary for the efﬁcient operation of the plan provide to the Social Security Board any information and data that it requests pay to the United States one-half of the net amount collected by any state (or its subdivisions ) from the estate of any recipient of old age assistance Requirements that the Social Security Board cannot impose on the states An age requirement of more than 65 years ; any residence requirement that excludes any resident of a state who has resided therein ﬁve years during the nine years immediately preceding the application and who has resided therein continuously for one year immediately preceding the application Title II: Federal Old Age Beneﬁts Establishing the trust fund An account is created in the U.S. Treasury , known as the Old Age Reserve Account , to which funds are appropriated for each ﬁscal year in an amount sufﬁcient to provide for the payments under this title to retired persons . Deﬁnition of eligibility People who are at least 65 years of age who have received after December 31, 1936, and before reaching age 65 a total amount of wages not less than $2,000. Ineligible categories of work include : agricultural labor domestic service casual labor not in the course of the employer ’s trade or business service performed as an ofﬁcer or member of the crew of a vessel documented under the laws of the United States or of any foreign country service performed in the employment of the United States government service performed in the employment of state governments or political subdivisions thereof service performed in the employment of not-for-proﬁt agencies Amounts of beneﬁts If total wages after December 31, 1936, and before the age of 65 are not more than $3,000, the old age beneﬁt shall be at a monthly rate of one-half of 1% of such total wages . If these total wages are more than $3,000, the monthly rate will be one-half of 1% of the ﬁrst $3,000 plus one-twelfth of 1% of total wages that exceed $3,000 and do not exceed $45,000. Title III: Grants to States for Unemployment Compensation Administration But in no case shall the monthly rate exceed $85. If someone dies before reaching 65, there shall be paid to his estate an amount equal to 3.5% of the total wages determined by the Board to have been paid to him with respect to employment after December 31, 1936. The federal government authorized appropriated funds to help states administer their unemployment compensation laws (Title IX discusses the actual unemployment program ) provided that the state provides fair and efﬁcient methods of implementing the program , including fair hearings . (If a state agency denies beneﬁts unfairly , the Board can stop making further payments to that state .) The Social Security Board , on collecting funds in the unemployment fund of each state , will give it to the secretary of the treasury , who will place it in the Unemployment Trust Fund . Each state agency administering the program pays its beneﬁts from funds from the Unemployment Trust Fund that are forwarded to it by federal authorities . Title IV: Grants to States for Aid to Dependent Children Nature of grants States make payments to needy dependent children with the federal government paying to each state an amount equal to one-third of the total of the sums expended in a given quarter , but not counting the amount of grants that exceed $18 per month with respect to one dependent child (in a family) and $12 per month with respect to each additional dependent child. Eligibility The term “dependent child” means a child under age 16 deprived of parental support by reason of death , continued absence from the home , or physical or mental incapacity of a parent—and the child must be living with his father , mother , grandfather , grandmother , brother , sister, stepfather , stepmother , stepbrother , stepsister , uncle , or aunt in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home . Requirements that states must meet The requirements are similar to those for Title I, but states cannot deny aid to any child who has resided in the state for one year immediately preceding the application or who was born within the state within one year of the application if the child’s mother has resided in the state for one year immediately preceding the birth. Title V: Grants to States for Maternal and Child Welfare There are ﬁve parts to Title V: Part 1 Provides funds to be paid to the states to enable them to extend and improve services for promoting the health of mothers and children , especially in rural areas and in areas suffering from severe economic distress . States must have plans for the services funded by the part approved by the chief of the Children’ s Bureau . (The state plan must include state contributions to the services and administration or supervision of the spending by the state’s health agency .) Part 2 Provides federal funds to help each state extend and improve services for locating children with disabilities and providing them with medical , surgical, corrective , and other services and care , particularly in rural areas and areas with severe economic distress . State plans must be approved by the chief of the Children’ s Bureau . Part 3 Provides funds for the purpose of enabling the Children’ s Bureau to cooperate with state public welfare agencies to establish , extend , and strengthen public welfare services , called child welfare services , for the protection and care of homeless , dependent , and neglected children , and children in danger of becoming delinquent . Part 4 Provides funds to the states to allow them to extend and strengthen their programs of vocational rehabilitation of people with physical disabilities— and to allow them to continue to carry out legislation enacted in 1920 to provide vocational rehabilitation to persons disabled in industry or otherwise to help them return to employment . Part 5 Provides funds for the maintenance of the Children’ s Bureau . Title X: Grants to States for Aid to the Blind Nature of the grant The federal government pays one-half of the funds expended by a state for aid to blind persons but not counting expenditures exceeding $30 a month—and 5% of the federal funds are to be used to administer the program . Inmates of public institutions cannot receive assistance under this title. Requirements that states must meet The requirements are similar to those for Title I. Protecting W orkers’ Right to Strike The National Labor Board that was established under the NRA had mediated conflicts between thousands of employers and employees. Senator Wagner proposed legislation that more clearly defined specific procedures to be followed when employees wanted to initiate a union and proposed establishment of an independent board to enforce the rights of union organizers. He fervently believed that such legislation would not only eliminate conflict but would bring economic recovery by increasing consumer purchasing power through the wage increases that would follow the growth of unions. * He proposed that employees should be allowed to circulate petitions to their fellow workers if they wanted an election to choose a collective bargaining agent and that secret elections, to be monitored by a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), should be required if more than 50% of employees requested it. Employers would have to officially recognize any collective bargaining agent that received support from a majority of employees in the secret ballot, could not fire or intimidate organizers, and could not claim that a company union sufficed when workers wanted to hold elections. When Senator Wagner introduced his legislation in 1934, Roosevelt withheld his support because he wanted union organizing to proceed gradually, so as to avoid a political backlash from business and the general public. He also wanted to place the NLRB within the Department of Labor rather than establishing it as an independent agency, so that Frances Perkins could administer it. When the NRA was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in May 1935, however, Roosevelt supported Wagner’s legislation, which had already been enacted in the Senate. * Despite strong opposition from business, the Wagner Act was enacted in 1935. It was partly responsible for an upsurge of union membership, which increased from 3.3 million workers in 1935 to 14 million workers in 1945. The growth of union membership had extraordinary political implications. Unions became the pillar of the Democratic Party from 1936 until the 1970s, providing it with the bulk of its campaign finances as well as tens of millions of voters. The Works Progress Administration and the National Youth Administration Soon after he terminated the CWA in early 1934, Roosevelt decided to develop a new work program to consolidate existing federal jobs programs into one piece of legislation. The legislation, entitled the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, was enacted in 1935 and required most of its funds to go directly to wages rather than to administrative overheads and to be spent quickly rather than held back for long-term projects. He mandated socially useful projects to be allocated to areas in relation to the number of workers who were on welfare rolls. * The intense rivalry that had existed between Ickes and Hopkins in 1933 continued following passage of the legislation. Both men wanted to head this new consolidated agency and sought Roosevelt’s support. Roosevelt favored Hopkins, but he had to move gingerly so as not to alienate Ickes, congressional conservatives who disliked Hopkins, or congressmen who wanted to exercise patronage in the massive new jobs agency. (Congress insisted that appointments of all persons earning more than $5,000 be subject to the consent of the Senate.) Roosevelt developed regulations that allowed the work programs to avoid undue patronage and placed them under Hopkins’s control. He made himself the nominal head of the agency to curtail efforts by senators to place political friends in key jobs. He placed Ickes in charge of a large decision-making committee that had the official power to decide which work projects to fund, but he placed Hopkins in charge of a division that was empowered to recommend small work projects and to veto other project applications. As mayors, governors, and other local officials initiated thousands of modest street, library, and public improvement projects, Hopkins forwarded them to the decision-making committees, which had to fund them to meet Roosevelt’s guideline that work funds be spent immediately—thus not diverting most of the funds to Ickes’s PWA. Hopkins used his veto power to defeat many of Ickes’s large and complex projects, on the grounds that they competed with the private sector or that insufficient skilled labor existed to implement them. When the frustrated Ickes obtained a ruling that all projects of more than $25,000 should be given to the PWA rather than to Hopkins’s division, Hopkins merely divided the larger projects into bundles of smaller ones. * The programs of Hopkins’s division, named the Works Progress Administration (WPA), dominated Roosevelt’s public works strategy from 1935 onward. Between 1935 and 1940, $14 billion was allocated to it, and 7.8 million persons received work relief. The WPA completed a remarkable array of projects and assumed a major role in disaster relief work, including the aftermath of floods, droughts, and hurricanes. Millions of Americans took on some semblance of dignity as they worked on these projects. The WPA inherited the local, state, and federal staff of the FERA, which was phased out following passage of the Social Security Act. Ultimate approval of projects came from Washington, but district or state branches of the WPA initiated and approved projects in consultation with local and state officials. Various administrative arrangements were established; some projects were completely supervised by local officials and others by WPA staff. Local units of government were usually required to contribute some 20% of a project’s budget through provision of in-kind costs such as materials and wheelbarrows. * The WPA was criticized from both the left and the right. Conservatives believed that it provided make-work jobs, that it enticed some people to become dependent on public jobs rather than seeking employment in the private sector, and that it competed with the private sector. Hopkins’s tireless advocacy of the program and his troubleshooting to deal with periodic crises in the field proved enough, however, to offset conservative criticism. Organized labor demanded that the WPA pay prevailing wages, but Roosevelt preferred a so-called security wage that was pitched between relief benefits and prevailing wages. Critics questioned Roosevelt’s decision to restrict the WPA to persons who were already on welfare rolls, as this policy penalized many destitute persons who had avoided welfare. (Roosevelt consented to a compromise policy in which roughly 85% of WPA enrollees came from welfare rolls.) Other critics objected to the discrepancy between the wages of unskilled and skilled workers; the former received half the wages of the latter. To distribute WPA jobs broadly, only one member of a family was allowed to participate; this policy often meant that women and adolescents could not receive work relief because administrators gave jobs to male heads of household. The WPA did not provide training to its workers or match workers to jobs so that they could increase their employment prospects while holding WPA jobs. It did not enjoy good working relationships with public welfare and employment offices, which lacked the staff to make sufficient referrals to it. * The WPA was never funded at levels that would allow it to help more than two-thirds of eligible persons, and Roosevelt declined to institutionalize it by placing it within the Social Security Act because some of his advisors did not want temporary programs included within the act. * Both Congress and the president seemed to fear that a declaration of a permanent works program implied an admission to voters that the administration had failed to correct the nation’s economic problems, and so the program struggled along with an uncertain future. * Despite its shortcomings, however, the WPA was remarkably successful and virtually free of fraud. Above all, it gave hope to millions of Americans who were unemployed. At the insistence of Eleanor Roosevelt, who was a determined advocate for youth, the National Youth Administration (NYA) was established within the WPA, with Aubrey Williams as its director. A broad range of programs was established, including college aid for impoverished students, aid for high school students, public jobs in recreation centers and municipal services, and camps for rural youth to provide them with trade skills. In 1936 and 1937, 600,000 youths, many of them in extreme poverty, were aided by the NYA, even though NYA wages were only one-third of prevailing wages. * Backsliding in the Supreme Court? The Supreme Court gave legal sanction to the conservatives when it declared the NRA and AAA unconstitutional in 1935 and 1936, respectively; indeed, between January of 1935 and June of 1936, the Court issued 12 rulings against the New Deal that rested on an assortment of constitutional objections. Roosevelt wondered whether virtually all major New Deal programs might be rescinded by the Court. * He wondered, too, if the Supreme Court would even declare the Social Security Act to be unconstitutional. Identify Roosevelt’ s Landslide V ictory over Republicans in 1936 EP 3a Roosevelt won a resounding victory in 1936, with the support of a liberal coalition of intellectuals, workers, Jews, and people of color. As much as 80% of the working class voted for him as compared with only 42% of affluent persons. He also retained the support of the conservative South, which had traditionally voted Democratic. After Roosevelt’ s smashing presidential victory in November of 1936, everyone was asking where the New Deal would go next. Hopkins, Senator Wagner, and others believed that Roosevelt had received a mandate to continue New Deal reforms—to obtain public housing programs, federal regulation of child labor and working conditions, an expansion of the WPA, and antilynching legislation. * LO 6-7 Assess the Era of Stalemate: 1937–1941 EP 7b EP 7c Roosevelt’s momentum seemed assured after his victory in 1936, yet he soon ran into a number of political barriers that, with the exception of several notable policy successes, ended his reform momentum. As we shall see, too, Roosevelt himself lost interest in domestic reforms as he grappled with aggression by Germany, Japan, and Italy against other nations. LO 6-8 The Disillusionment of the Middle Class With the realignment of political parties by social class in the 1930s, many middle-class persons joined working-class voters to support Roosevelt and congressional Democrats in the elections of 1932, 1934, and 1936. However, as the decade wore on, some middle-class voters began to hedge their reform interests because the nation’s economic ills continued, and the unprecedented expansion of government bureaucracy led them to wonder if Roosevelt was leading America toward socialism. However, anger at the New Deal often focused not on Roosevelt, who retained his personal popularity throughout the decade, but on some of his advisors and programs. Hopkins was widely believed to want unlimited personal power. Perkins was perceived as soft on militant labor unions and as a charity- minded social worker who blindly supported new programs. Many persons resented the intellectuals who formed Roosevelt’s brain trust. * Some middle-class Americans also became alarmed by labor organizations, such as the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which they feared would gain inordinate power. The sit-down strikes of 1937, in which workers occupied automobile plants, were profoundly disturbing to many middle- class citizens, who believed that such disruptive techniques exceeded the bounds of fair play. * Thus, in the late 1930s and early 1940s, middle-class voters gradually shifted their support to the Republican Party; indeed, when he was reelected in 1944, Roosevelt received only 53% of the votes cast. Fears that Roosevelt Sought T oo Much Power These growing doubts about New Deal reforms among the middle class were supplemented by widespread opposition to Roosevelt’s attempts to pack the Supreme Court and to purge the Democratic Party in 1937. Many liberals had been furious at the Court for its adverse rulings and had developed various legislative proposals for neutralizing it—for example, a proposal requiring a two-thirds vote of the justices to declare legislation unconstitutional. (Congress has the constitutional power to determine the size and voting procedures of the Court.) Had Roosevelt not acted, Congress might have enacted legislation to limit the Court, because 150 such measures were introduced in Congress in 1937. * Roosevelt remained silent on the issue until 1937, when he introduced a legislative proposal to allow the president to appoint a new justice every time a justice failed to retire within six months of his 70th birthday. Perkins advised him not to introduce this proposal because the Court not only appeared to be wavering in its attacks on New Deal programs but was widely regarded as sacrosanct. * When Roosevelt persisted, he ran into a storm of political protest; he was accused of upsetting the constitutional balance of powers, seeking unlimited personal power, and trying to establish a fascist dictatorship. * Moreover, Roosevelt was unable to purge the Democratic Party of dissident Southern Democrats, whose conservative opposition was magnified by their fears that Roosevelt would support civil rights measures. Enraged by these defections, he targeted several Southern politicians for political attack by traveling to their districts to campaign for their rivals. However, he suffered a humiliating defeat when each of these politicians was reelected. * Roosevelt’s political effectiveness in the early and middle 1930s depended in part on his image of political invincibility. He had obtained so many legislative and electoral victories that many opponents believed it would be fruitless to oppose his policies and feared that he might deny them patronage or personal support in their campaigns. His Supreme Court and political defeats in 1936 and 1937 tarnished his image of invincibility, however, and emboldened members of the conservative coalition, as well as some moderate Democrats, to question his policies. * Reform Fatigue Many middle-class Americans had become less enamored with Roosevelt’s policies by late 1935. Convinced that individuals were personally responsible for their unemployment, they resented federal work and relief programs, which they believed sapped the initiative of recipients. They increasingly questioned Roosevelt’s economic policies as the nation remained mired in depression. Considerable animus developed toward Harry Hopkins, who was perceived to be a welfare czar and was widely believed to reward Democrats with jobs in the federal bureaucracy. Many Americans resented the burgeoning of the federal bureaucracies, which had become highly visible during the implementation of hundreds of New Deal programs. They also disliked the brain trust, academicians, and theorists, whose ideas had not solved the nation’s economic malaise. * Several Surprising Policy Successes in 1937 and 1938 Roosevelt was able to obtain some major policy reforms after 1936, despite the loss of his reform momentum. Despite the failure of his attempt to pack the Supreme Court with new justices, Roosevelt achieved a notable victory. The Court in several rulings made clear that it would not overturn the bulk of New Deal legislation—and would not question the constitutional ability of the federal government to develop and fund major social programs. Funding of New Deal Programs The funding of the WPA, CCC, and NYA, particularly after the recession of 1937, was increased. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 Perhaps Roosevelt’s signal accomplishment was passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Fair working conditions and minimum wages had been established for each industry under the NRA, but many industries returned to sweatshop conditions when the Supreme Court declared the NRA to be unconstitutional. With assistance from Perkins, Roosevelt supported legislation that established minimum wages and maximum hours, but he had to make concessions to conservatives to secure its passage. Farm labor was excluded from the legislation to appease Southern and Western agricultural interests. Wage and hour standards were phased in gradually so that the minimum wage rose from 25 cents per hour to 40 cents per hour over a period of seven years. The maximum length of a workweek diminished from 44 to 40 hours per week in three years. * Even this legislation aroused considerable controversy. Southern Democrats feared it would elevate the wages of poor African Americans, even though agricultural laborers were excluded from it. The AFL opposed it because they feared the minimum wage might establish a ceiling on wages and would decrease the motivation of workers to join unions. Some critics were unhappy that the Department of Labor would administer the legislation because they believed Perkins favored unions. * The Wagner-Steagall Housing Act In 1937, Roosevelt was able to obtain passage of the Wagner-Steagall Housing Act, which established the United States Housing Authority to provide low-interest loans to local authorities to build public housing. * Attacking Administrative Abuses of W elfare Programs The Roosevelt administration expended considerable energy in implementing the many programs of the Social Security Act. Federal regulations and policies to govern OAA, ADC, AB, and unemployment insurance programs were issued. States were monitored to be certain that uniform standards of eligibility were established and followed, that names of recipients were not published, and that political criteria were not used in eligibility decisions. Federal officials pressured states to develop their ADC and OAA programs rapidly; nonetheless, some states had barely started their programs by 1940. Federal authorities occasionally threatened to cut off federal funds to states that were remiss in administering their programs. * Reorganizing Federal Social Welfare Programs Roosevelt realized by 1937 that he also needed to simplify the organization of federal programs; social welfare programs were scattered in the Departments of Interior, Treasury, Labor, and Agriculture, as well as in independent commissions and elsewhere. No department focused on social welfare issues, and no cabinet-level secretary coordinated the planning and implementation of social programs. He appointed a committee to examine this issue; the committee recommended the establishment of a Department of Public Works and a Department of Welfare, whose directors would sit in his cabinet. The plan was defeated in the Congress in 1938 because legislators feared that it had been masterminded by Hopkins to enhance his personal power, to increase Roosevelt’s political patronage, and to increase the power of the federal government. The plan was also attacked by advocates of existing programs, such as the CCC, who feared that these programs would lose power if they were transferred to the new agency. * Roosevelt reluctantly retreated to a more modest proposal to create a subcabinet agency known as the Federal Security Agency (FSA) and a Federal Works Agency under the Reorganization Act of 1939. The FSA contained the CCC, the NYA, the Public Health Service, the U.S. Employment Service, and the Social Security Board, whereas the WPA and the PWA were placed in the Federal Works Agency. This legislation was enacted, but not until 1953 was a department of the federal government finally created to house the nation’s social programs—the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, which became the Department of Health and Human Services in the mid-1970s. That Roosevelt even had to create the FSA speaks volumes about the social welfare accomplishments of the New Deal. If virtually no federal social programs or policies existed before 1933, a national welfare state now existed whose programs needed to be housed in articulated federal agencies. Analyze Conservatives’ Ascendance Roosevelt’s surprising social policy successes in 1937 and 1938 did not, however, portend a resurgent New Deal—whether because of ascendant conservatives or the diversion of Roosevelt’s attention to looming international threats from Germany, Japan, and Italy. Though conservatives never loved Roosevelt, they sometimes tolerated him because of the nation’s economic straits—and even voted for much of his social legislation. A conservative coalition consisting of Republicans, Southern Democrats, and some political moderates had developed considerable cohesion within the Congress by 1935, however, and rallied opposition to FDR’s policies. Southern Democrats, who held many committee chairs in the House and Senate and had traditionally possessed a good deal of power in the Democratic Party, felt that their party had been taken over by liberal Northerners and by urban reformers such as Senator Wagner. Their anger mounted when they were not consulted by Roosevelt on many policy issues (see Insert 6.5 ). Insert 6.5. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: Roosevelt’s Dilemma—What to Do about Southern Democrats? Southern Democrats presented Roosevelt with an ethical dilemma. They were a large part of his Democratic Party and controlled virtually every congressional committee. When they voted with Republicans against New Deal legislation, they could defeat social reform measures. Roosevelt’s dilemma was this: When should he oppose the policy preferences of Southern Democrats and when should he defer to them? Should he have risked defeat of the Social Security Act by demanding more liberal provisions in it, such as national minimum standards for welfare grants? Or was he correct in acceding to many of the Southern Democrats’ demands? Discuss the ethical merits of both approaches and then decide, on balance, whether he made the ethically meritorious choice. Roosevelt also confronted another related ethical dilemma. Northern liberals, like Senator Robert Wagner, wanted federal legislation to make the lynching of African Americans (a common occurrence in the South) a federal crime. Believing the Southern Democrats would oppose his New Deal if he supported antilynching legislation, Roosevelt maintained a discreet silence on the legislation until late in the decade; even then, his support was tepid. Did he err, ethically, when he made this choice? President Barack Obama hoped for bipartisan support for the Stimulus Plan like FDR obtained in the New Deal for his social initiatives. He received none from Republicans, who now has large numbers of Southern members of Congress. Is bipartisanship between parties and between the North and South a thing of the past in 2018 and beyond? Business interests, which had often supported Democratic candidates, increasingly gave their allegiance and money to Republicans when confronted with legislation that would markedly increase the taxes of affluent persons and corporations. With Roosevelt’s electoral successes, Republicans’ opposition to the New Deal became increasingly militant; they realized that they might remain the minority party for decades if they could not arrest Roosevelt’s political momentum. * Roosevelt’s political problems were compounded by the increasing opposition of a group of 13 Republican senators, called the insurgent progressives, who were ideological descendants of the Progressive Era. They had provided vital support to New Deal programs during Roosevelt’s first term and had championed agricultural reforms, the TVA, antimonopoly policies, and higher taxes on the wealthy; but they disliked large federal bureaucracies, feared Roosevelt had too much power, wished to preserve strong policy roles for states, and feared the use of social programs for political patronage. They increasingly resented the deployment of a major portion of New Deal resources to urban areas and workers. Their distrust of Roosevelt and his policies reached paranoid proportions by 1936, when they were convinced that he sought to establish a dynasty beholden to urban interests. Their anger mounted in 1937, when Roosevelt attacked the Supreme Court and did not publicly rebuke the disruptive tactics of automobile workers. Furthermore, they had come to detest the size of the federal government. Their distrust of Roosevelt was expressed in negative votes on many pieces of legislation and in increasing cooperation with Southern Democrats and more conservative Republicans. * After Woodrow Wilson’s failure to rally the leaders of European nations behind a League of Nations that would work to avert future wars, the United States moved strongly in the direction of isolationism in the 1920s. It almost completely demobilized its army and navy—leaving it with military forces far smaller than many European nations. Separated by two oceans from Europe and Asia, Americans felt secure from military invasion, prompting the leaders of both parties to cut military spending further. Even in the aftermath of World War I, however, Roosevelt feared that the United States would go to war with Germany one day. He even saw to it that some of the WPA’s projects were geared toward preparedness, such as the construction of military airports. His fears escalated when fascist Adolf Hitler cemented his control over Germany, articulated aggressive intentions toward the rest of Europe, and developed a racist concept that specific white Europeans (which he called Aryans) were innately superior over other peoples—and as a militarist elite gained control of Japan and began a course of conquest against other Asian nations. Germany soon made an alliance with Italy and its dictator Benito Mussolini, further increasing Roosevelt’s fears of looming war. Understand why Roosevelt Prioritized Military Preparedness Firmly believing in isolationism, most Americans were not perturbed even by Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939 or by Great Britain’s subsequent decision to declare war on Germany. As these developments took place, Roosevelt’s attention no longer focused on domestic issues even though the Great Depression and widespread unemployment continued. Often secretly, he sent money and supplies to Great Britain. He gave speeches that eloquently pointed to military dangers that loomed from Germany, Japan, and Italy. He sought small increases in military spending—and then larger ones. He urged Congress, with limited success, to institute a military draft and to upgrade the nation’s military preparedness, such as by manufacturing tanks, airplanes, and weapons. He placed Harry Hopkins in charge of the Department of Commerce in 1938 so that Hopkins could work with industry to develop plans to build military equipment. Understand the Eclipse of W ork Programs Roosevelt suffered many policy losses during the waning years of the New Deal. A program to provide a large revolving federal fund to finance public works was defeated. Knowing they would be rebuffed, Roosevelt declined to support health legislation and a redistributive tax act. As the nation rearmed, Congress periodically raised the national debt limit but, as the price of their compliance, conservatives demanded and often obtained major cuts in social spending. Roosevelt failed in his bids in 1937 and 1939 to have the CCC made a permanent program because conservatives did not want to establish the principle that ongoing federal programs were needed for the nation’s youth. An ambitious proposal to develop programs like the TVA in seven other river basins was defeated. * The fiscal survival of the New Deal became even more imperiled when Roosevelt decided to increase funding for the War Department and the navy to prepare for possible war with Germany and Japan. Facing an isolationist Congress, he sought only small increases in military spending in 1938 and 1939—but he persuaded the Congress in 1940 to increase military spending massively after Hitler invaded Denmark, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. Wanting to increase aircraft production to 50,000 planes per year and to augment production of other armaments vastly, he obtained military appropriations of $17 billion—nearly two times the entire federal budget of the preceding year. It was obvious by 1940, then, that the New Deal was fiscally imperiled. As the nation spent greater funds on its military, unemployment began to subside and had largely vanished by late 1941. Because Roosevelt had justified his New Deal primarily to deal with unemployment, his rationale for the New Deal also vanished as unemployment finally began to decline when jobs in rearmament industries increased. It is ironic that the nation finally discovered in 1941 that massive spending—far greater than the relatively meager spending devoted to New Deal programs—would end the Great Depression. Moreover, rising military spending led conservatives to urge even further cuts in New Deal spending, calling it “nonessential” spending as compared with military spending. Even Roosevelt had reduced his support of the New Deal by 1940, increasingly referring to it in the past tense and using its work programs for projects with military significance such as airports and ships. (Roosevelt even put a military officer in charge of the WPA.) It was a difficult period for many New Deal reformers, as they increasingly feared that key New Deal programs would lose funds or even be eliminated. The increases in military spending in 1940 and early 1941 were small, however, compared to the military spending that would take place in the wake of America’s entry into World War II after the surprise attack by Japan on the Hawaiian Naval Base known as Pearl Harbor. Military planners soon received military expenditures totaling $120 billion to increase the army to 8.5 million men when it had consisted of 140,000 troops only two years earlier. Liberals watched with dismay as many New Deal work programs were dismantled during World War II when unemployment ceased due to military production and conscription of millions of men and women into the armed forces. The WPA, CCC, PWA, and NYA were terminated by 1943. Franklin Roosevelt failed to make much of an effort to save the programs, but they were probably doomed because unemployment had vanished. Nor was Roosevelt inclined to involve himself in domestic controversy since he wanted bipartisan support of the war effort—giving conservatives more power than they had possessed before the war. The huge wartime deficit— unprecedented in American history—also made it difficult to justify spending that was not essential to the war effort. * It is important to remember, however, that many New Deal policies remained intact, including the Social Security Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, housing legislation, the TVA, and the Wagner Act. To these were added a huge policy initiative during World War II: the GI Bill, which would provide college and vocational training to millions of veterans in the wake of World War II. Review the Oppression of V ulnerable Populations in the New Deal EP 1a EP 1b EP 2a EP 2c EP 3a EP 3b In the New Deal, attention focused on the problems of unemployment and relief, as millions of Americans were economically devastated by the Great Depression. But women, Latinos, African Americans, and Asian Americans bore a disproportionate share of the economic suffering and sometimes wondered whether the New Deal spoke to their broader needs as well as their economic deprivation. In some cases, the economic plight of whites heightened animosities between the dominant population and vulnerable groups, both during the Depression and during World War II. LO 6-9 The Oppression of W omen The achievement of suffrage did not lead to policy gains for women, who found themselves unable to vote as a bloc or to agree on policy issues. Some women, including Eleanor Roosevelt, favored passage of protective legislation that shielded women from dangerous or physically taxing occupations; other women, who believed that protective legislation would merely close certain jobs to women, supported an equal rights amendment to the Constitution to grant women legal equality with men. * Eleanor Roosevelt became a determined advocate for women during the early years of the New Deal. Because the CCC camps were statutorily limited to males, she persuaded her husband to establish 45 camps for 8,500 women under the FERA. Working closely with Molly Dewson, director of the women’s division of the Democratic Party, she secured the appointment of many women to high-level posts in the FERA, the WPA, and other agencies. * Almost no women obtained work relief in the CWA, but 15% of WPA recruits were women. The Wagner Act helped spur the organizing of women; between 1930 and 1940, for example, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union tripled its membership to 800,000 persons. Although many women—about 20%—lost their jobs during the Great Depression, others found their employment to be more secure than men’s; they tended not to work in heavy industry but rather in gender-segregated occupations that were relatively unaffected by the economic downturn. With the expansion of government programs, vast numbers of clerks and secretaries were hired, and the percentage of women in the federal workforce rose from 14% in 1929 to 19% in 1939—twice the rate of increase of male employment. * Women also made major strides in obtaining sexual freedom. The flapper of the 1920s partially escaped Victorian moral codes. A majority of middle- class married women used birth control during the 1930s; their physicians provided them with the information they needed. However, many poor women, who could not afford doctors, lacked access to birth control information because birth control clinics were still illegal in many areas under the obscenity laws that had hampered Margaret Sanger two decades earlier. * The economic and social gains of women in the New Deal should not obscure the continuing discrimination against them. It was widely assumed that married women should relinquish their positions to allow the employment of unemployed men; indeed, some women lost federal jobs after federal legislation in 1932 (which was not rescinded until 1937) stipulated that husbands and wives could not both hold federal positions. Many administrators in the CWA and the PWA assumed that husbands should receive priority in work relief programs. NRA labor codes tended to establish lower wages for women than for men in identical positions. Widows were not entitled to receive Social Security benefits of their deceased husbands until 1939; even under the new policy, the woman was not entitled to the benefits unless she was living with her husband at the time of his death. * Social Security was also expanded in 1939 to give modest benefits to the wives of retired workers—so long, that is, as she had been his wife for at least five years and was living with him at the time of the application. (Divorced women and remarried women had to forfeit these benefits.) Because Social Security benefits were tied to wage levels, female retirees, who usually came from low-wage occupations, received lower benefits than did males. Women who worked as domestics or in agriculture were not included in Social Security at all. * Unemployment insurance also discriminated against women. Because applicants were required to have a recent and extended employment record, women who left the labor force to have a child—or for other family reasons—could not easily reestablish eligibility after they resumed work. Many women were also denied benefits because they refused a “suitable job” that was a distance away or that required they work hours that were incompatible with their family responsibilities. * Nor were benefits paid for pregnancy or maternal (or paternal) leave—an omission that remains in place today. Until 1950, the ADC program did not provide benefits to the heads of households but only to the children, and federal authorities provided a smaller share of the funding of ADC than of OAA. Because it provided grants only to children in families headed by a single mother, ADC offered no assistance to the children of married women, many of whom were in considerable need. Trade unions generally excluded women from leadership positions and often negotiated contracts that gave women lower pay than men. The AFL leadership even demanded that women who were married leave their jobs so as to make available more employment for males. * The cult of domesticity, which had dominated American family life for a century, remained intact; many married women who worked outside the home encountered hostility from their husbands and peers, even when they limited their horizons to gender-segregated and low-paying jobs. Moreover, psychologists, psychoanalysts, and physicians, such as Dr. Gesell and Dr. Spock, defined the role of the mother ( not the father) as an all- encompassing one that was dictated by the needs of their children. Love between mother and child was the magic and necessary ingredient to be provided in “a perfectly nourishing environment” with mothers avoiding “outside commitments so as not to ‘miss’ a fascinating stage of development,” so that mother and child “could enjoy each other, fulfilling one another’s needs perfectly, instinctively, as if Nature in her infinite wisdom has created them [to be] two happily matched consumers consuming each other.” * Thus defined as Supermom, women were truly confined to their homes through much of their married lives. The Oppression of Latinos Spanish-speaking persons constituted the majority of field workers in the irrigated farms of the Southwest by 1930. Despite some successes, violent suppression of agricultural unions, as well as red-baiting, led to the demise of pioneering unions. As farm workers were not covered under the Wagner Act of 1935, they did not have collective bargaining rights that were enforced by the federal government; thus, employers could fire anyone they suspected of trying to organize the workers. In remote farming areas, the workers lacked access to lawyers and advocates. Even the few unions that had developed ended with the onset of World War II, when many organizers and workers were drafted or migrated to cities. As we have already noted, farm workers did not receive Social Security benefits or unemployment insurance. When thousands of unemployed Latinos sought welfare in the 1930s, local welfare officials demanded massive “repatriation” (forced evacuation) to Mexico. Around 400,000 Latinos were forced to leave the country between 1929 and 1934. Many of them, with $14.70 in their pockets from the U.S. government, were placed on trains to Mexico City; the impact on families and communities was devastating. When faced with the need to produce huge quantities of food during World War II, the federal government initiated the bracero program through a bilateral agreement with Mexico in 1942. The Mexican government, which wanted to alleviate domestic unemployment, allowed a specified number of Mexicans to enter the United States to meet labor shortages on farms; in return, the U.S. government pledged to ensure a minimum wage and to guarantee their just treatment. Extended annually until 1964, the program brought a total of 5 million Mexican laborers to the United States. In addition, many undocumented workers continued to flow into the United States during this period. But not bound by any agreements with the Mexican government regarding undocumented workers, employers that hired them—mainly agribusiness and mining companies—were able to treat them virtually as they wished. Despite efforts by the Mexican government to secure their rights, braceros were subjected to countless abuses—in particular, poor wages, lack of housing, and lack of health care—and unions were no more successful during and after World War II than in the 1930s. During World War II, sizable Latino populations had settled in urban areas; they worked in munitions factories, shipbuilding, and other industries. Like African American workers of the period, they lived in segregated communities, in neighborhoods that had been abandoned by white populations fleeing to areas with better amenities. These urban Latinos encountered considerable racial animosity. In Los Angeles, for example, white sailors on shore leave frequently attacked Latino youth who wore zoot suits—flamboyant outfits featuring long jackets with padded shoulders. Resentment at these attacks led to the so-called zoot-suit riots. The Los Angeles police, well known for their brutality against Latinos, regularly conducted mass roundups and incarcerations. * The Oppression of African Americans As the New Deal began, discrimination against African Americans continued unabated in both the North and the South. Because Jim Crow laws remained in force throughout the South, African Americans were disenfranchised, forced to live in segregated neighborhoods, required to sit at the rear of buses, and enrolled in segregated schools. Bad as these violations of civil rights were, they were overshadowed by the many instances of violence against African Americans. The Ku Klux Klan, long a presence in the South, had a resurgence in the 1920s and struck terror in the hearts of African Americans with a sustained campaign of lynchings and beatings. Hard times increased racism because many whites feared that African Americans would take employment from them. Faced with layoff decisions, many employers fired African Americans and retained white employees, sometimes in response to agitation by white citizens. As had been common before the 1930s, African American workers were denied membership in many unions and were used as scabs by employers to break strikes. Southern whites were furious, too, that African Americans received far higher wages under the WPA than they had received in the fields, and they feared that the New Deal programs would disrupt the political and economic structure of the South by dramatically improving the economic condition of African Americans. * African Americans desperately needed federal civil rights legislation that would rescind Jim Crow laws and outlaw discrimination by unions and employers, as well as job and service programs to provide resources and employment. But Roosevelt, during most of the New Deal, refused even to support legislation that would make lynching a federal crime; he finally gave it no more than verbal support late in the 1930s. Nor did he support legislation to eliminate the poll tax, which was widely used in the South to disenfranchise African Americans, or legislation to counter segregation in housing markets, despite urging by African Americans and Senator Wagner. * Why didn’t Roosevelt throw his support behind civil rights legislation? He knew that Southern Democrats would become determined opponents of his domestic programs if he supported civil rights legislation, particularly if they voted with Republicans in the so-called conservative coalition. (As we have seen, Roosevelt’s forebodings came true in 1937 and succeeding years, when the conservative coalition militantly attacked many New Deal initiatives. * ) Indeed, even before 1937, Roosevelt had to make key concessions in unemployment, Social Security, public welfare, NRA, and fair labor and standards legislation to obtain the support of Southerners. * Roosevelt and his aides also felt that African Americans were discriminated against because they were poor rather than because they were African American, and thus New Deal programs like the WPA, which gave jobs to African Americans, would end discrimination more effectively than would civil rights legislation. This perspective was tragically naive. Racism exists as a force that is independent of social class; in contemporary society, for example, affluent and well-educated African Americans still experience discrimination in job and housing markets. In the New Deal era, as we have already noted, some whites became even more hostile to African Americans, whom they viewed as competitors for jobs and even WPA positions. And the disposition of some whites to lynch African Americans was hardly linked to their precise economic status, as the epidemic of lynchings throughout the 1930s illustrated. If many New Dealers were disinclined to support federal civil rights legislation, they were also reluctant to develop programs that specifically provided African American populations with resources and jobs. The creation of special programs for African Americans or even a policy of requiring quotas for African Americans in specific New Deal programs was opposed because such programs and quotas were perceived to represent reverse discrimination. * Without such special treatment, however, it was doubtful that African Americans could overcome the economic and social chasm that existed between themselves and the white population. African Americans nonetheless obtained notable policy concessions. Because it was obvious that many local officials and project review committees would exclude African Americans from eligibility in the FERA and CWA programs in 1933, Hopkins, Williams, Perkins, and Ickes appointed African American advisors to monitor implementation of programs and to work in tandem with investigators to detect flagrant cases of discrimination. * They also appointed African Americans to high positions in New Deal social programs. See Insert 6.6 for a Profile in Leadership about Mary McLeod Bethune. Insert 6.6. Proﬁles in Leadership: Mary McLeod Bethune (1875–1955) Mary McLeod Bethune—humanitarian, civil rights activist, teacher, organizer, and social reformer—was born on July 10, 1875, in Mayesville, South Carolina. She is best remembered for her work in promoting education within the African American community and encouraging the development of pride, self-respect, and self-control among African American women. McLeod was the 15th of 17 children born to Samuel McLeod and Patsy (Mclntosh) McLeod, slaves who were freed following the end of the Civil War. While many of her colleagues succeeded in the face of adversity, it was actually the adversity McLeod faced beginning in her early childhood that stimulated her desire for learning and led her to become successful in all her endeavors. Briefly, the incident that triggered McLeod’s interest in books and learning occurred when she was nine years old. One day, she accompanied her mother to work at the home of a white family. While her mother did her chores, McLeod was invited to join a couple of white children who were playing in their playhouse. Midway through their games, she picked up one of the girl’s books and attempted to read it. The owner of the book verbally chastised McLeod, reminding her that she was not allowed to handle books for purposes other than handing them to white people. Condescendingly, the white girl offered to instead show McLeod pictures, as if to imply that she was not capable of comprehending the written language. This marked the first time the young McLeod experienced the pain of exclusion. Moreover, this incident provided the catalyst for the beginning of McLeod’s intense desire to be formally educated, which she was determined to accomplish so that others might be spared the pain she had experienced. McLeod was 11 before she entered her first classroom. In 1887, she began studying at the Scotia Seminary, located in Concord, North Carolina. Upon completing her work at Scotia Seminary, McLeod accepted a scholarship to attend the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago from 1894 to 1896, where she was trained to become a teacher. Before she established her own school, McLeod’s compassion for people led her to teach and work with people who were in jail and with those who were underprivileged. In May 1898, Mary McLeod married Albertus Bethune, a student at Avery Institute in South Carolina and later a businessman in Georgia. By 1899, Mary Bethune had opened a parochial school, which she operated with the help of a Presbyterian church in Palatka, Florida. Five years later, after saving a little money from a brief stint as an insurance salesperson, she moved to Daytona. Once there, Bethune quickly recognized the educational needs that existed within the African American community. Several months later, Bethune opened the Daytona Educational Institute and Training School, which, from 1911 to 1930, also housed the McLeod Hospital and nursing school. In 1923, she merged her school with a Methodist men’s college, Cookman Institute, and formed what became known as the Daytona Collegiate Institute. (In 1928, the institute was renamed Bethune- Cookman College.) By 1934, Bethune, a longtime friend of first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, was busy with several federal projects involving education in the African American community. She was a member of the National Advisory Committee to the NYA. In 1936, President Roosevelt appointed Bethune director of the NYA’s Division of Negro Affairs, a program that sought to eliminate race differentials in the distribution of NYA benefits and vigorously promoted education and training within the African American community. Unfortunately, in 1944, Bethune’s work with the federal government ended because the NYA program was abolished. Despite the setback of losing the NYA, Bethune remained actively engaged in addressing the needs that existed in other areas throughout her community. In 1935, she organized and presided over the National Council of Negro Women, which had as its main objective the advancement of African American women and providing solutions to many of the problems they faced. She also served as vice president of the National Urban League and was an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. From 1938 to 1948, she was a prominent figure in the Southern Conference for Human Welfare. In 1951, she was appointed to the Committee of Twelve for National Defense by President Truman. In 1953, Bethune established the Mary McLeod Bethune Foundation for research, interracial activity, and promoting broader educational opportunities for African Americans. In May 1955, Mary McLeod Bethune, who succeeded not despite adversity but because of it, died in Daytona Beach. In the summer of 1974, Bethune was honored by the U.S. government with the unveiling of the Bethune Memorial in Washington, DC. In 1976, a portrait of Bethune was placed on permanent display in the South Carolina Statehouse. Both instances marked the first time an African American had received such honors. Discrimination nonetheless existed within New Deal programs. Except for a few camps in New England, the CCC was segregated. Roosevelt feared racial conflict within integrated camps as well as political opposition from Southerners. (Ugly incidents occurred in a number of camps before they were segregated.) African American enrollees were not transported to CCC camps in other states because of opposition by whites and fear for their safety. * Housing built by the PWA was often segregated. * Many New Deal programs—in particular, programs to help farmers refinance their mortgages or obtain loans—were of no assistance to African Americans, most of whom were tenant farmers. The NRA often allowed Southern industrialists to establish wage codes that froze the existing inequitable wages for African American workers. * Moreover, as we have seen, payments made to landowners under the AAA for withdrawing acreage from production were often not passed on to African American tenant farmers and sharecroppers, despite legislation that required such transfers. Curiously, African Americans gained a major victory during World War II when reformers asked why African Americans should sacrifice their lives in the war if units of the army were segregated, if African American workers in war industries had to live in segregated housing, and if African Americans encountered discrimination in wartime industries. Many whites, including some liberals, exhorted African Americans not to raise these issues during the war so as not to divide the nation; but A. Phillip Randolph, the fiery African American director of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids, was so incensed by the prevalence of job discrimination against African Americans, even in war industries desperate for labor, that he advocated a massive march on Washington to force Roosevelt to sign federal legislation that would ensure the fair employment of African Americans in the defense industry. So as not to disrupt the war effort, Roosevelt finally relented in 1941 by signing Executive Order 8802 to prohibit discrimination in employment in the defense industry on the basis of race, creed, or national origin—on the condition that plans for the march be abandoned. (Executive Order 8802 also established the Committee on Fair Employment Practices to monitor the private sector, though the committee was given such scant funding that it could not assertively investigate many complaints of discrimination.) Because Randolph was unable to persuade Roosevelt to sign an order to desegregate the armed forces, the war was fought with segregated battalions until President Truman finally desegregated the armed forces at the war’s end. * Hundreds of thousands of African Americans who returned from the military at the end of the war encountered extraordinary prejudice in both the North and the South. Moreover, the African Americans who had migrated to cities during the war constituted a growing underclass with limited economic prospects. Thus, the civil rights accomplishments of the New Deal were very limited. A huge chasm existed between white and African American populations in this era, as suggested by public opinion polls. Poll data in 1939, for example, indicated that 69% of whites thought African Americans were less intelligent and that most whites endorsed segregated restaurants, neighborhoods, and schools (respectively, 99%, 97%, and 98% of Southerners and 62%, 82%, and 58% of Northerners). * An African American social worker ominously predicted in the 1930s that provision of welfare benefits to African Americans without civil rights and jobs legislation risked perpetuating their inferior economic and social status. Three decades later, Jesse Jackson, a former aide to Martin Luther King, Jr., repeated that warning when he noted the existence of a massive population of African Americans who encountered bleak job prospects, poor educational programs, and minimal job-training programs and whose survival often hinged on the receipt of welfare benefits. * Yet World War II set the stage for the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Persons of color were asked to risk their lives in armed conflict but were not granted basic human rights in the military or in the United States when they returned home. Angered by this inequity, a generation of African Americans vowed, upon their return, to fight for civil rights on the home front. They were joined by returning Latino, Asian American, and Native American soldiers who experienced similar indignities on their return to the United States. Considerable success was obtained in enrolling African Americans, who constituted 10% of CCC enrollees and more than 15% of WPA workers. * The PWA and NYA were particularly innovative; the PWA established a quota system that required its private contractors to reach specific goals in their hiring practices; and the NYA was the only major New Deal agency that established special programs restricted to African American enrollees. * The inclusion of millions of African Americans in New Deal programs represented a major policy feat in a nation that had often denied African Americans access to local relief programs. The Oppression of Asian Americans The migration of Asians to the United States was effectively curbed with the Immigration Act of 1924, which limited annual immigration from specific countries to the percentage of the population of the corresponding group in the United States in 1890, when few Asians had migrated. (Chinese migration was banned altogether by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.) Even though Asian immigrants were not allowed to own land in many areas by state legislation, they had shown extraordinary ability to continue farming—by leasing land or by finding cooperative Americans who put their own names on the deed but allowed the Asians to work the land. Moreover, Chinese American and Japanese American communities channeled their energies into developing a thriving network of small businesses. The Nisei (second-generation Japanese Americans, the children of the Issei, or first generation), who were U.S. citizens by virtue of birth, placed extraordinary emphasis on education, which was seen as a way of overcoming the barriers imposed by discrimination. Caught between American and Japanese culture, the Nisei nonetheless sought, with their parents’ blessing, to master English, to go to college, and to use their educational achievements to obtain jobs that had been denied their parents. * But a strong undercurrent of racism existed toward this population. This racism could be shockingly intense, as Takaki points out. He cites the example of a young Japanese man from Hawaii who went to get his hair cut. On hearing that he was Japanese, the barber drove the young man out of his shop “as if he were driving away a cat or a dog.” * People even spat on Japanese persons whom they encountered on the street. First-generation Asian Americans were denied citizenship on the grounds that they were non-Caucasian aliens—and then denied access to relief programs during the Great Depression on the grounds that they were not citizens! Nor were the Nisei able to escape discrimination, even with their college degrees. As the depression hit, most Nisei were unable to find jobs for which they had been trained; virtually no jobs were open to them in engineering, manufacturing, business, or even high school teaching. Trapped in family businesses, almost no Nisei worked for white employers even as late as 1940. * Asian Americans worked largely in restaurants and laundries, and a pattern of systematic discrimination prevented them from working in other occupations. Recall that many Americans on the West Coast had feared an invasion from Japan even at the start of the century and had demanded the immediate cessation of all immigration from Japan. The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought an immediate fear that Japanese Americans would conspire with Japanese agents to facilitate an invasion by the Japanese. As other Asian Americans tried frantically to show that they were not of Japanese ancestry, Japanese Americans found themselves isolated and subjected to hatred and violence. They waited fearfully to see what would happen next. Roosevelt had received confidential reports before and soon after Pearl Harbor that the Japanese Americans did not constitute a threat to national security. The press, however, printed a chorus of rumors that Japanese Americans were conspiring with Japanese agents and reported widespread calls for their immediate internment. Unlike General Delos Emmons in Hawaii, General John DeWitt of the Western Defense Command became a zealous persecutor of Japanese Americans and conducted many search-and- seizure operations to find hidden transmitters. White farmers, who resented the success of Japanese American farmers, demanded their evacuation, partly out of a desire to obtain their land. Roosevelt was urged by his attorney general not to evacuate the Japanese Americans, and it was obvious that rounding them up without due process would be an infringement of their civil rights. Nevertheless, Roosevelt and other advisors were determined to proceed—and often used blatantly racist language in their private conversations. * Executive Order 9066, although it did not mention Japanese Americans, empowered the secretary of war to develop “military areas” where he could confine whoever he thought was a security risk. Rumors that Italian Americans and German Americans might be apprehended sparked widespread protests, but no protests emerged when about 120,000 Japanese Americans were rounded up and taken to internment camps located in remote rural areas, with no due process and no hearings. (See Figure 6.4 .) Because they were able to take only what they could carry, they were forced to sell their houses and belongings within a matter of days; under these circumstances, they were often forced to accept nominal amounts for their possessions. Figure 6.4. Details The National Archives The forced confinement of Japanese Americans in World War II. The Japanese Americans were given numbers and were required to wear them on tags from the point of evacuation onward. They were housed in assembly centers, shipped to remote internment camps with no idea where they were going, and greeted by barbed wire and guard towers in the camps. Curiously, the American authorities, who had incarcerated them as security risks, soon sought to persuade draft-age youth to volunteer for the armed services, but only after they agreed to sign loyalty oaths; partly to protest the internment, many of them did not volunteer—and draft protests broke out in 1944 when the military tried to conscript them. Nonetheless, 33,000 Nisei served in World War II, many with distinction. Evacuation orders had been rescinded before the end of the war, and some of those internees who agreed to sign loyalty oaths were allowed to settle in cities not on the West Coast, such as Denver and Chicago. But the damage had been done to several generations of Japanese Americans. Those who were still alive finally received symbolic compensation in the 1990s. This incident involved a unique situation, but is not trivial. It was (and is) widely perceived by Asian Americans as an illustration of the impact of racism on American social policy. Leaders who had implemented dozens of humane policies were nonetheless able to take extraordinary actions that were fueled by racism; indeed, those actions provoked scant protest even from liberals. To critics, the episode was the tragic culmination of the New Deal’s consistently poor record on civil rights, not just for Asian Americans but for other people of color and women as well. The American government did, however, finally rescind its ban on Chinese immigration in 1943—more than 60 years after its original passage. In the end, the ban was lifted for utilitarian rather than moral reasons; the United States could not justify Chinese exclusion without endangering its alliance with the Chinese. * Analyze the Broadened Role of Social W ork in the New Deal EP 4a EP 6a EP 7b By the end of the 1920s, social work had consolidated its position, with the development of many schools, most of which were associated with universities. An explosion of demand for social workers occurred as, freed from the old preoccupations with relief giving, the profession attended to a host of problems, including family disruption, medical problems, child pathology, school problems, and outpatient services to persons released from mental institutions. The old charity organization society agencies, some 200 nationwide, developed the American Association for Organizing Charity, where they officially changed their mission from relief giving to family casework. In the 1920s, nongovernment social agencies developed so-called federated fundraising, in which many agencies banded together to seek donations from corporations and their employees in a united drive; this later became known as the United Way. In 1921, the new profession developed a mass-membership professional organization, the American Association of Social Workers, even if most of its early members lacked professional training. The future looked promising for this new profession; it had developed a core technology (social casework) and network of social agencies, sources of funding (the federation), and many schools. * LO 6-10 Social casework, which emphasized diagnosis and “scientific work,” still bore some resemblance to the older charity work because it focused on the person in the environment. * Both in diagnosis and interventions, caseworkers examined environmental factors that shaped the problems of their clients and used this information to help clients cope with situational realities. But in the 1920s, the primacy of social casework was challenged by the emergence of psychiatric social work, which drew heavily on the ideas of Freud and his disciples, as illustrated by the works of Virginia Robinson and others, which were markedly different from older works by Mary Richmond. Psychiatric social work did not dominate the profession in many schools and agencies, but it was a highly visible wing of social work and had a particularly strong hold on certain schools, such as Smith College and the University of Pennsylvania, and certain kinds of agencies, such as child guidance agencies and psychiatric hospitals. Some proponents of social casework feared that this new contender, which emphasized intrapsychic matters and family relationships, could sever social work from its person-in-the-environment emphasis as well as its work with relatively impoverished populations. Social workers were not usually involved in social reform projects or in public agencies during the 1920s. Even many of the old settlement houses, though still existing, had lost their reformist qualities, as well as their visible leadership within the profession. Social workers were not highly active in partisan politics, although they supported specific candidates whom they believed were interested in certain social issues. Many social work leaders took an intense interest in the national presidential campaign of 1928, however. They could not agree on which candidate to support; Al Smith had been receptive to social workers during his tenure as governor of New York State, and Herbert Hoover had pursued humanitarian work after World War I in Europe and shown interest in unemployment issues during the 1920s. * Nevertheless, a sizable number of social workers continued to believe that social work should remain separate from partisan politics altogether. Thus divided, the profession was as unready for the political upheaval of the Great Depression as many other citizens were. Many leaders maintained, as did Hoover, that private agencies would suffice to manage the economic destitution that occurred in 1929 and 1930. They were in for a rude shock, however, when they found that private agencies, like the Red Cross, lacked the funds to help the throngs of destitute people. Indeed, vast numbers of social agencies, one-third of them in New York City alone, went bankrupt because of the rising caseloads and the drop-off in private philanthropy. Increasing numbers of social workers realized by 1930 that strong government action was needed, even if many of them still did not see the Democratic Party as the necessary instrument of reform. (As we have already seen, Jane Addams voted for Herbert Hoover, not Franklin Roosevelt, in 1932. * ) By 1932, however, many social work leaders had come to dislike Hoover for his disinclination to take bold action to help unemployed people. Curiously, the Great Depression and World War II actually benefited the social work profession. Although most social workers had been employed in private agencies in the 1920s, thousands of jobs opened up in New Deal agencies in the 1930s. The number of people in social work positions increased from 40,000 in 1930 to 70,000 in 1940. * During the 1920s, a cohesive community of leaders in New York City became acquainted with Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins and assumed leadership and consultative roles to Franklin Roosevelt during his governorship of New York State. Many of these social workers assumed influential positions in the New Deal, supported the FERA, the NRA, and the CWA, and sought to professionalize New Deal programs by insisting on prominent roles for social workers. * Indeed, Hopkins supported many training programs for social workers. When the Social Security Act mandated the creation of the Social Security Board, social workers received key appointments to it and also to its Bureau of Public Assistance, which supervised ADC and the other welfare programs. Social casework proved to be adaptable to these new public agencies, which sought to screen, refer, and give brief assistance to the many destitute people who used the New Deal programs. At the same time, the psychiatric wing of the profession continued to ply its trade in various private agencies, which existed throughout the 1930s. Many of the new social work positions were filled by untrained people. Paid relatively low salaries and acutely aware that the New Deal programs provided only meager benefits to desperately poor people, these staff members developed lively protest movements to seek both better pay for themselves and greater benefits for their clients. * Mary Abby van Kleeck and the publication Social Work Today issued fiery denunciations of the New Deal, which many believed was captive to corporate interests. The so- called rank-and-file movement of nonprofessional public employees of New Deal programs developed unions of public employees, supported sweeping social reforms, and often joined with or helped to organize poor persons as well as their own clients. By 1937, however, their protests had dissipated, perhaps because many of them had become part of the establishment and civil service protections had been extended to them. * World War II brought more growth to the profession. Social workers were hired by the Red Cross and other agencies that helped soldiers. Private agencies worked with relocated workers, day care, and other social issues on the home front. * At various points during the 1930s and 1940s, social workers wrestled with the question of how selectively the profession should define its boundaries. One faction wanted the profession to markedly increase its membership to include the legions of untrained people who worked in public programs— and, in the 1940s, to include people with only a bachelor’s degree. They believed that the power of the profession would increase as it broadened its boundaries and that the quality and prestige of many social work positions could be increased by including their incumbents in the profession. Another faction wanted to restrict membership in the profession to individuals with a graduate degree to keep the caliber of professional work at a high level and maintain the prestige of the profession. The two factions often clashed, but for the moment, the selective faction was victorious. * As in the Progressive Era, opinions within the social work profession reflected attitudes within the broader society. Most of the leadership was sympathetic to Roosevelt, even if they were sometimes embittered by, for example, his termination of the CWA and some of the conservative features of the Social Security Act. In the 1930s, virtually all social workers were convinced of the need for government to fund and deliver a host of services; thus, the curious hold of nongovernment agencies on social welfare was ended forever. Perhaps we can say that social work became a part of the broad coalition that Roosevelt had fashioned in the New Deal, to the extent that the profession was viewed as liberal in succeeding decades as well. When Richard Nixon and other conservatives cast about for enemies some decades later, they unhesitatingly seized on social workers; some social workers took that as a sign that the reformist traditions of the profession remained at least somewhat intact. Yet, some social workers supported relatively backward-looking policies during the New Deal—for example, restriction of ADC grants to those families whom caseworkers judged to provide “suitable homes”; that policy would have given social workers a strange veto over the intake process in public welfare. * And some social workers remained safely outside the turmoil of the New Deal, working in child guidance and other agencies with a psychiatric focus. On the left, a small faction sided with decidedly radical protests in the late 1930s, including the Communist Party, the rank-and-file movement, and the Socialist Party. They often argued that social work had been coopted by Roosevelt to participate in inadequate social programs and that, by doing so, it was blunting significant social change that could occur only by aligning the profession with grassroots dissent. This discussion of social work in the 1920s and 1930s suggests that a lively controversy existed within the profession over a number of issues. For example, to what extent should the profession engage in social action rather than just counseling? Should the profession have relatively broad or narrow membership? And to what extent should the profession ally itself politically with liberal forces? We can see certain central tendencies in the developments of the 1920s and 1930s, such as the dominance of casework, the decision by most social workers to support relatively liberal social policies but not radical reforms, and the preferences for a relatively restrictive membership policy. But these central tendencies ought not to obscure conflict within a profession that, in some respects, was a microcosm of the society that enveloped it. Place the New Deal in the Context of the Reluctant W elfare State EP 5c When viewed from the perspective of the Progressive Era, the New Deal represents a striking departure from traditional American policies on two counts. First, unlike progressive reformers, who focused on state and local reforms, Roosevelt created a national welfare state that superseded local programs. Second, he created social programs rather than focusing on the regulatory strategy of the Progressive era, as was illustrated by the first major social programs in the United States that distributed jobs (the CWA, WPA, CCC, and PWA) and resources (the FERA and the Social Security Act) to destitute and elderly Americans. By going beyond the legalistic approach of progressives, Roosevelt drastically altered the scope of the American welfare state. It is easy to criticize the New Deal from the vantage point of contemporary society. New Deal reforms did not include the range of civil rights, medical, housing, SNAP, and other programs that were developed in subsequent reform eras, and they often were diluted by compromises with conservatives. Roosevelt nonetheless accomplished his reforms in a society where virtually no national social programs had existed and in the face of profound social, legal, and political opposition. In venturing into new policy territory, he often stumbled and changed directions, but he developed precedent-shattering policies that helped millions of citizens survive an economic catastrophe. He opportunistically changed policies as political LO 6-11 realities changed, but he was remarkably consistent in his basic policy goals. He was a firm believer in capitalism, but he sought regulatory, tax, and social welfare policies to mitigate economic uncertainty and the suffering that accompanied it. He opposed ideology, whether socialism or unfettered capitalism, and preferred instead to seek practical reform policies in the political context that he encountered. In 1932, Frances Perkins wrote on a piece of paper a series of six reforms that she favored; by 1940, only national health insurance had not been enacted. * Roosevelt’s social welfare innovations were matched by political accomplishments that prevented conservatives from dismantling all of his social reforms after World War II. He created the modern Democratic Party, which, for all its faults, embraced a relatively liberal constituency. Voting preferences in the nation were associated for the first time with social class and with political ideology; African Americans, workers, Jews, and intellectuals tended to support the Democratic Party, whereas affluent, white Americans tended to vote Republican. The numerical size of this liberal constituency made it difficult for Republicans to rescind the New Deal—unless they could persuade large numbers of working- and middle- class voters that social reform was not in their best interest. This did not happen to any significant degree until the administration of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Still, viewed from the vantage point of today’s society, New Deal reforms were timid. The social reform agenda of the 1960s and 1970s was largely fashioned to address social problems that were not included within New Deal reforms—federal medical programs, national civil rights legislation, federal assistance for persons with mental disorders, programs to help persons with disabilities, educational and nutritional programs for those with few resources, and job-training programs. The various New Deal programs often helped less affluent persons survive their immediate destitution, and Roosevelt did obtain some tax reforms, but the federal tax system was not so fundamentally reformed as to alter existing economic inequality or to provide sufficient revenues to support an ongoing and substantial welfare state. The realignment of the political parties was not accompanied by an economic or social revolution that redressed inequalities between classes or races. As a consummate politician, Roosevelt was sometimes overcautious in supporting social reforms. He did not aggressively support union organizing; did not try to institutionalize a public works program; delegated many social welfare functions to states and localities when the Social Security Act was enacted; and often resorted to budget-cutting even when it led to widespread suffering. Moreover, he did not seize the opportunity to mobilize a liberal party as aggressively as he might have; he was too enamored with coalition politics, except when he ineffectually tried to purge Southern Democrats. Roosevelt did not grasp the political uses of the labor movement until late in the decade. * Particularly when prodded by conservatives, Roosevelt and Perkins gave states considerable discretion in setting eligibility and program standards in many of the New Deal programs, even when this policy allowed conservative and Southern states to impose punitive and racist standards. Workers in America were more heavily burdened by the payroll taxes of the Social Security program than were affluent persons—and they received only short-term and relatively miserly unemployment benefits. Americans in poverty who did not fit the restrictive eligibility requirements of OAA, ADC, and AB were forced to receive welfare assistance from relatively punitive local programs. Where do we place the blame for these various shortcomings in New Deal policy? To some extent, Roosevelt reflected the hesitations and biases of American society. Because the nation entered the decade with no tradition of federal leadership in social welfare, the first programs were greeted with suspicion and uncertain funding. So preoccupied were reformers with establishing the precedent of federal programs that they often could not seek their enlargement or had to make compromises to conservatives in both parties to establish them. * Many of Roosevelt’s advisors, as well as a large contingent of liberals in the Congress, had their ideological roots in the Progressive Era, when emphasis was placed on local reforms, and were reluctant to develop a large federal bureaucracy or permanent federal programs. * There was widespread prejudice against programs that assisted urban dwellers and workers, even though most Americans lived in cities. Work relief programs were controversial in a society that assumed industrious persons could find work or that believed government should not interfere with the private sector. Deficit spending was also unpopular. Roosevelt was able to enact the policies of the New Deal only because the Great Depression brought unprecedented suffering and thereby created a political climate in which social reform could be tolerated. Roosevelt lacked strong and certain allies on the left whom he could rely on for consistent support. Charismatic but eccentric leaders such as Father Coughlin and Huey Long were as adept at demagoguery as they were at supporting reforms. The CIO proved a more certain ally, but the AFL was lukewarm about the Fair Employment Practices Act and opportunistically used programs like the WPA to secure jobs for its own members. It is ironic, in retrospect, that President Ronald Reagan attacked Roosevelt’s New Deal in the 1980s as America’s venture into socialism. It was hardly socialism; it was a tentative foundation for a welfare state that would provide minimal public benefits to some people in poverty and to older Americans. The nation’s social and economic inequalities, as well as its racist and sexist policies, remained intact. Link the New Deal to Contemporary Society What W e Can Learn from Policy Advocates of the New Deal EP 1a EP 1b EP 1c EP 2a EP 3a We suffer from an embarrassment of riches when we seek policy advocates who have much to teach us in contemporary society. Let’s discuss Eleanor Roosevelt and Mary Abby van Kleeck because each in their own way, but very different ways, tried to push the New Deal to be even more liberal in its approach. See Inserts 6.7 and 6.8 . Insert 6.7. Proﬁles in Policy Practice and Advocacy: Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962) LO 6-12 Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, sometimes called the “First Lady of the World,” was born on October 11, 1884, in New York City, to Elliot and Anna (Hall) Roosevelt. Though her family was both distinguished and wealthy, Roosevelt nonetheless was lonely and unhappy throughout her childhood. Before she was 10, her parents and younger brother had died. She and her brother Hall were the only survivors. Eleanor Roosevelt, who remembered herself as a child without beauty or the joy of youth, had often felt rejected by her beautiful mother, who nicknamed her “granny.” Shortly after her parents died, Eleanor went to live with her grandmother, who was also distant. Eleanor Roosevelt was closest to her father, a charming and loving man. But he was an alcoholic who only occasionally saw Eleanor and who left an emotional void in her life when he died. Eleanor Roosevelt’s life and political thought were greatly influenced during her time at Allenswood, an exclusive girls’ school outside of London. There, she came under the guidance and influence of Marie Souvestre, a liberal-minded teacher with a passion for reform crusades. Through her close involvement with Souvestre, Roosevelt became aware of her political consciousness and returned to New York City uninterested in the self-centered and frivolous lifestyle characteristic of her class. She joined the National Consumers’ League, which was headed by Florence Kelley, and began visiting sweatshops and factories. She developed an activist spirit and a commitment to the poor by witnessing the oppression of workers, who had few protections in this era. She believed that the gathering of information was half the battle of reform—hence her promotion of the idea that successful reformers were, first, successful investigators and educators. She married Franklin Roosevelt, a distant relative, in 1905. It seemed at first that her family would become her major focus as she gave birth to six children between 1906 and 1916. But family life never satisfied her broader interests. Moreover, she had to constantly battle her mother-in-law, a dominating woman. She learned about her husband’s infidelity in 1918. Although she and her husband decided not to obtain a divorce, they never again had conjugal relations, focusing instead on their political and reform interests. She became increasingly involved in her husband’s political career after 1910. By 1917, with America’s entry into World War I, she was presented with the opportunity to focus her reform efforts on issues of vital and immediate concern. She began working at Washington’s Union Station canteen for soldiers who were headed to training camps. She also took charge of Red Cross activities and the knitting rooms at the Navy Department. At patriotic rallies, she gave speeches and called on Americans to do the right thing concerning the European crisis. She also became actively involved in a reform campaign to improve conditions for the mentally ill at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital. In the 1920s, following the onset of her husband’s crippling disease, her political involvement and reform crusades began to intensify. She learned the politics of legislation while a member of the Women’s City Club of New York and the League of Women Voters. Working on the New York Women’s Democratic Committee and the New York State and National Democratic Committees, she learned how to use political mechanisms to achieve successful reform. During this same period, Roosevelt became involved with several settlement house programs, which drew her attention to the complex problems faced by the urban poor and the connections between impoverished neighborhoods, poverty, crime, and disease. In 1922, Roosevelt became a member of the Women’s Trade Union League, or WTUL, where she worked for improved labor conditions for women. It was during her involvement with the WTUL that she became devoted to promoting the rights of laborers everywhere. She went so far as to develop the concept of a “living wage,” which included the basic material necessities as well as educational, recreational, and emergency needs. By 1928, Eleanor Roosevelt began using both her status as “first lady” and the publicity that surrounded her to assert her own personality and goals. As the leader of the national women’s campaign for the Democratic Party in 1928, she insisted that the party appeal to independent voters, minorities, and women. When her husband became governor of New York, she was instrumental in the appointment of Frances Perkins to the industrial commissioner’s office. During the Great Depression, she served as a conduit between reform associations and the New Deal’s programs and machinery. Once in Washington, DC, Eleanor Roosevelt became involved in a women’s political reform movement, which led her to bring an unprecedented number of dynamic female reformers to the nation’s capital. She was also instrumental in providing the women’s movement with a national forum. During press conferences, Eleanor Roosevelt often called on women leaders to discuss their work and transmit their views and concerns. These events highlighted the importance of women’s issues and spawned a community of female reporters and government workers. Throughout the 1930s, Roosevelt toured the country, visiting coal mines, relief projects, and acting as an advocate for millions of poor and disadvantaged Americans. She shared her deep compassion for the suffering through her syndicated newspaper column, “My Day,” her weekly radio programs, and the lectures and speeches she gave while touring the country. At the White House, Eleanor Roosevelt pressed the case for African Americans and young people, and she was instrumental in the creation of the National Youth Administration. She constantly pestered her husband to support liberal legislation such as antilynching laws. During World War II, Eleanor Roosevelt continued to work for the disadvantaged and fought to keep the New Deal operational. Most of her humanitarian efforts during this period were focused on improving the situation for African Americans, women, Jewish refugees, and wounded veterans. But in the immediate postwar years, she took up a new cause: world peace and aid for the millions of victims of the war. President Truman appointed Eleanor Roosevelt as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations. There, she focused her attention and lobbying efforts on the creation of international law for the protection and promotion of human rights. On December 10, 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which she essentially wrote, was approved by the General Assembly. Throughout the 1950s, she continued to press for the causes of civil rights, humanitarianism, and international cooperation. In 1961, she was appointed by President Kennedy to her last official position as chair of his Commission on the Status of Women. Her work with the commission reflected her personal commitment to advancing the cause of women’s equality. Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, who broke and remade the mold for the role of the modern presidential spouse, died at her home in New York City on November 7, 1962, and was buried beside her husband next to his ancestral home and presidential library in Hyde Park, New York. Insert 6.8. Proﬁles in Policy Practice and Advocacy: Mary Abby van Kleeck (1883–1972) Mary Abby van Kleeck, once described by the Survey as a “stormy petrel,” was born in Glenham, New York, the daughter of Reverend Robert Boyd van Kleeck and Eliza (Mayer) van Kleeck, Episcopal minister and daughter of one of the founders of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, respectively. In 1892, following the death of her father, the van Kleeck family moved to Flushing, New York. In 1904, van Kleeck received her B.A. from Smith College. van Kleeck’s interest in the industrial workers’ situation began in 1905, when she launched her career in social research. After serving as a fellow in New York’s College Settlement Association, she focused on researching the conditions faced by women workers in New York factories, and, subsequently, on child labor within New York’s tenements. In 1907, the Alliance Employment Bureau created a department of industrial investigations and named van Kleeck its director. There, van Kleeck’s research was focused on investigating the industrial situation in general and women’s employment in particular, where she documented unsafe working conditions and low wages. Her pioneer investigative work, which involved noteworthy research methods and attention to the relationship between wages and the workers’ standard of living, earned her the support of the Russell Sage Foundation in 1908. In 1916, the Russell Sage Foundation established the Department of Industrial Studies and appointed van Kleeck director. Between 1914 and 1917, van Kleeck taught courses on industrial conditions and industrial research at the New York School of Philanthropy. In 1915, together with Edward T. Devine, van Kleeck completed an occupation study on positions in New York’s private agencies. Meanwhile, van Kleeck became involved in Mayor John P. Mitchel’s committees on unemployment and the National Social Workers’ Exchange. By 1918, van Kleeck’s expertise in the area of women’s employment had earned her the recognition of the federal government’s Ordnance Department, which subsequently appointed her director of the women’s branch of the industrial service section. In her capacity as director, van Kleeck was successful in getting the War Labor Policies Board to adopt her proposed standards for the employment of women in defense industries. In July 1918, van Kleeck became the director of the Department of Labor’s Women in Industry Service. In 1921, van Kleeck, a member of the President’s Conference on Unemployment, was chosen to sit on the Committee on Unemployment and Business Cycles. At the same time, she served as a trustee for Smith College, chaired the National Interracial Conference, and bolstered the social work profession by organizing the American Association of Social Workers. Unlike many of the social reformers of the 1930s, van Kleeck became a staunch critic of the New Deal. She criticized the New Deal for failing to address the problems that stemmed from both the economic and political structure of the United States. She charged that the New Deal maintained the status quo by weakening the rights of labor unions and bolstering the rights of industrial monopolies. She therefore advocated for comprehensive social insurance and social welfare programs and fought for the right of labor to organize and to strike. Her opposition to the New Deal and the policies championed by the National Recovery Administration led to her resignation from the Federal Advisory Council of the United States Employment Service in 1933, one day after being appointed to it. In 1934, in Miners and Management , van Kleeck argued that the economic and political structure of the United States would have to be transformed if poverty was to be prevented and the standard of living for all Americans raised. Thus, van Kleeck advanced the idea of a planned economy in which industry and all natural resources would be socialized. In her 1936 economic and political analysis of the United States, Creative America , she outlined an approach to implementing what she envisioned to be a collective economy built on the principles of scientific management and political democracy. Her support for an alignment of social work with organized labor led van Kleeck to become actively involved in the rank-and-file movement, a left-leaning movement within the social work profession that sought to unionize welfare workers and staff in New Deal programs, as well as local social service agencies. By 1928, van Kleeck understood that any analysis of problems arising from economic structures must include an international perspective. With this in mind, she became involved as associate director of the International Industrial Relations Institute; she chaired the program committee for the World Social Economic Congress and was president of the Second International Conference of Social Work, which was held in Germany in 1932. By the late 1930s, far ahead of her time, van Kleeck began studying the effects of technological change on employment and wages. In 1944, together with May L. Fledderus, director of the International Industrial Relations Institute, van Kleeck published Technology and Livelihood , an analysis of modern technology and the resulting change in labor requirements. Their study found that changes in technology led to an increase in productivity without a corresponding increase in employment opportunities and job security. Mary Abby van Kleeck continued to research and write throughout the remainder of her life. She continued to promote the transformation of the economic and political structure of the United States, which she firmly believed was the primary source of social injustice and poverty. Because of her beliefs and crusades for radical change, in 1953 she received a subpoena from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy, which sought to link her to the Communist Party. Van Kleeck died in Kingston, New York, on June 8, 1972. We can learn from Eleanor Roosevelt that a commitment to engage in policy advocacy often stems from identification with “underdogs” in society rather than with established elites, whether low-wage workers, women, tenant farmers, or persons with serious mental conditions. In view of the fact that she grew up in an affluent family—and married a distant relative who himself came from high society—it is remarkable how completely she dedicated her life to helping the disenfranchised at home and abroad. Eleanor Roosevelt also teaches us how closely linked electoral politics and policy advocacy often must be. Genuine advances for vulnerable populations often come through advances in public policy that require the assent of elected officials in local, state, and federal legislatures, as well as in mayoral, gubernatorial, or presidential offices. No matter how skilled policy advocates may be, they are not likely to succeed if they cannot appeal to sufficient numbers of public officials who also side with underdogs. The linkage between electoral politics and policy advocacy was nowhere more evident than during the 1930s. The Republican Party was highly conservative in this era. Even President Herbert Hoover’s timid measures to deal with the Great Depression were viewed as too radical by many Republicans. Had Franklin Roosevelt not achieved landslide victories in 1932 and 1936, it is unlikely that he would have been able to get the Congress to enact many of his New Deal programs. Eleanor Roosevelt worked incessantly to advance Democrats’ electoral fortunes in the 1930s. She spoke at numerous campaign rallies. She talked political strategy with her husband. She sought promising candidates for specific offices. With universal suffrage achieved only about a decade earlier, she encouraged women to vote—and to vote for the Democratic Party. She freely gave her husband political strategy. Yet Eleanor Roosevelt cannot merely be labeled a political partisan because she viewed herself as a person who linked the needs of oppressed populations with political elites of both major parties. To use the parlance of our policy advocacy framework in Figure 2.1 , she was an agenda builder seeking to place many issues on the agendas of public officials. To educate herself about the hardships encountered by oppressed persons, she personally visited settlement houses, mental institutions, factories, mines, and rural areas. She commissioned reporter Lorena Hickok to roam the nation during the Great Depression and to relay specific information about persons that she observed, such as the man who told her that he could not afford dental care for his wife’s rotting teeth. She relayed the information that she gathered about social needs to the nation through her weekly radio program, her syndicated newspaper column, and her lectures in a way that no other presidential wife has even attempted. She became a public figure almost as widely known as her husband in her nonstop quest to induce Americans toward moral outrage at the demeaning conditions that she discovered. She provided this information to her husband on almost a daily basis. Sometimes, of course, her efforts as a policy advocate were unsuccessful, such as when she tried to convince her husband to admit young women to the CCC. Yet she succeeded in getting women into the WPA and NYA, as well as bringing about other changes. Eleanor Roosevelt also illustrates the importance of personal connections in policy advocacy because she had inside access to the most powerful public official in the nation—Franklin Roosevelt. None of us can aspire to privileged access on this level—but we can seek personal connections with leaders of advocacy groups and some public officials as we relay to them specific information about social needs that we observe. If we feel intimidated about forging these relationships with leaders and public officials, we must realize that persons with power want information about social issues so that they can assume a leadership role. If Eleanor Roosevelt influenced social policy from inside the administration with strategic links to her husband and other influential politicians such as Democratic Senator Robert Wagner from New York, Mary Abby van Kleeck sought to influence social policy from the outside as an advocate for unions, industrial workers, and women. She correctly identified some key concessions that Roosevelt made to corporations when it formed the National Recovery Administration (NRA), including allowing them to set prices and wages with relatively minimal influence from consumers or unions. Why not, she asked, allow unions to organize by enacting collective bargaining at once? (Such legislation was belatedly enacted in 1935, but only after Roosevelt had rejected the legislation in 1934 to avoid a political backlash from the general public and from corporations.) Nor was Mary Abby van Kleeck happy about Roosevelt’s decision to end the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) and replace it with Aid to Dependent Families (ADC), Old Age Assistance (OAA), and Aid to the Blind (AB). This policy meant that all other persons who needed cash assistance had to go to relatively punitive local welfare programs (often called General Assistance or General Relief) that received no federal funds and that gave out starvation-level benefits. This policy also meant that intact families with need for cash assistance had to go to these local programs. van Kleeck was also angry that social workers who actually delivered services and benefits to the recipients of these and other New Deal programs were severely underpaid and often worked under demeaning conditions. She led the charge to unionize these workers in the so-called rank-and-file movement that she also hoped would become a major force for policy advocacy to bring clients higher benefits and more lenient standards of eligibility. It would take many decades for social workers in public and some nonpublic agencies to become unionized under the aegis of unions such as the Service Employees Industrial Union (SEIU)—a union that has also assertively sought many social reforms. The life of Mary van Kleeck illustrates how policy advocacy can be conducted within the framework of social work organizations, whether unions or the local and state chapters of the National Association of Social Workers. She also illustrates how some policy advocates usefully enliven discussion of policy options by challenging existing public officials to consider more radical alternatives—including such notable liberals as Franklin Roosevelt. Policy advocates can work within the power structures of society or “on the outside” as leaders of social movements or advocacy groups. As a prominent African American leader, Mary McLeod Bethune worked in both capacities (see Insert 6.6 ). She organized and led the National Council of Negro Women and was vice president of the National Urban League— groups that pressured the government from outside for federal programs to help African Americans secure job training and educational scholarships— and also served with distinction as the director of the NYA’s Division of Negro Affairs, where she was an advocate from a government position. Social work advocates in contemporary society often move back and forth between advocacy groups and positions within government. As one of the first persons of color to obtain a high-level post in government in the 20th century, Bethune also illustrates just how recently they were excluded from positions of power. Insert 6.9. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: Does the Federal Minimum Wage Meet Ethical Standards for Social Justice? Identify a family with three or four members in the neighborhood where you live. Assume a single breadwinner who earns $7.25 per hour. Also assume one of the family members has a chronic health condition that requires out-of-pocket payments of $1,500 per year. Calculate what this family would pay for their rent, food, transportation, and other necessities to help you address this question. Now assume that the family is headed by a single woman who also has child care costs. Could she afford to live in your neighborhood? What W e Can Llearn from the Persistence of Unmet Needs and Policy Issues during the New Deal In the 1930s, America was thrust into the depths of the Great Depression. Millions of Americans were without work; millions more were hungry or starving; millions were homeless. Being poor and all of its attendant problems now affected a broad cross-section of the country, and the scope of economic instability and deprivation affected all levels of American society. The federal government’s response to the problem was the New Deal. Fast-Forward to the 21st Century Today, millions of Americans lack sufficient food; millions of Americans are homeless and live on the streets. Many of those who are hungry and/or homeless are employed and are still unable to meet the cost of basic needs for themselves and their families. America’s Second Harvest, the nation’s largest network of emergency food providers, defines food insecurity as “limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways.” * Recent estimates are that approximately 17.2 million households are food insecure or hungry. * According to Feeding America’s Hunger in America 2010 National Report, approximately 5.7 million people per week were receiving assistance from Second Harvest’s emergency food services across the country. This number represents a 27% increase from the 4.5 million people per week reported in its 2006 survey. Of those 5.7 million people, 76% were food insecure and 36% were hungry. Of those seeking assistance in 2006, more than one-third were households with children under the age of 18. In 2010, the number of children served by Feeding America increased by 50%. More than one-third of the households had at least one employed adult. Seventy percent of those seeking services had incomes below the official poverty level in the month preceding the request for help. A quarter of those receiving assistance did not have health insurance; nearly half reported they had unpaid medical and hospital bills. * Forty-one percent of households received SNAP benefits, representing a 64% increase over figures reported in 2006. Food insecurity greatly increased during the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009. Unemployment rates exceeded 10%, for example, in 13 states in 2009—and remained above 7% throughout 2013. By 2006, the number of homeless persons in this country was hovering around 3.5 million in a given year, roughly 40% of them children—and greatly increased during the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009 and beyond. * The magnitude of the problem bears a striking resemblance to the situation of the 1930s, when shantytowns emerged in many communities across the country and soup kitchens were overwhelmed as they attempted to feed the hungry. Unlike the 1930s, however, today’s homeless situation affects not only the unemployed but a vast number of working poor. In an article in the Christian Science Monitor , Roll states, “There is no town, city, or state anywhere in America where an individual or family working full-time and earning the minimum wage can afford a one- or two-bedroom apartment at the fair market rental rate established by HUD.” * The New Deal was America’s first venture into the development of a universal economic safety net to ensure access to the basic necessities of life for its citizens. The programs developed within the New Deal made the difference between life and death, eating and starvation, housing and homelessness for millions of Americans. The challenge to advocates for the poor, the hungry, and the homeless today is to learn from past efforts, build on successes, and avoid the failures of previous attempts to address these basic quality-of-life issues. The failure of corporations to give their workers an adequate wage led to the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that empowered the federal government to establish a minimum wage. Many reformers assumed that Congress would raise the minimum wage sufficiently over time so that it would keep up with inflation and provide workers with sufficient resources to have an acceptable standard of living. The promise of the minimum wage policy has not been realized, however, in most parts of the nation in recent decades. Due primarily to opposition from Republicans and business interests, the level of the minimum wage substantially eroded over a period of decades—and was raised by the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour by 2009. President Barack Obama pledged in his State of the Union Address in February 2013 to raise the minimum wage to $9.00 per hour—and Senator Bernie Sanders introduced legislation to increase the minimum wage to $15 in 2017. What W e Can Learn from Failed Policy Strategies of the New Deal While the New Deal provided work to millions of Americans during a period of high unemployment, as well as cash assistance through the FERA, it did not provide these Americans with job training aside from those skills that persons learned fortuitously in specific work projects. Nor did the ADC program provide work training. It is understandable that President Roosevelt’s first challenge was the humanitarian one of providing work and survival resources to unemployed people. To also include job training in the CWA and the WPA would have been costly. Moreover, New Dealers were hard-pressed just to address the magnitude of needs in the Great Depression without also adding a job- training provision. Yet a national system of job training that was linked to the work and relief programs of the New Deal might have provided a model for Americans in future decades—and might have offset the widespread belief even in the 1930s that persons who engaged in work and relief programs were “free loaders,” a stigma that dogged ADC (and later AFDC when the word “families” was added to the program’s title) in succeeding decades. What W e Can Learn from Promising Strategies of the New Deal The New Deal demonstrated that a long-held assumption in the United States was incorrect—namely, the idea that the federal government constitutionally could not become a major force in social welfare. It also undermined another widespread belief: that the federal government lacked the ability to develop and oversee major social programs. The New Deal had faults, but it was not corrupt, used public resources efficiently, and developed an array of enlightened policies including the Social Security Act. It also moved quickly, developing huge programs in a remarkably short period of time. Had the New Deal been widely viewed as a failure, it would have deterred policy advocates from seeking federal remedies to many social problems in succeeding decades. In fact, scores of such policies currently exist, as we will see in succeeding chapters. The New Deal also demonstrated that the American welfare state can and should help citizens find employment. While it can be faulted for not providing workers with job training and not developing a national system of vocational training, it nonetheless placed millions of persons in jobs who would otherwise have been unemployed. It experimented with ways, too, of ending the Great Depression, even if it failed to increase government spending sufficiently to end the Great Depression until the nation began to rearm just before its entry into World War II. The need for public employment will likely increase in coming decades because many experts predict that technology will eliminate many jobs, including taxi drivers, drivers of 18-wheel trucks, warehouse workers, workers in manufacturing plants, check-out workers, and many others. What We Can Learn from the New Deal about the Structure of the American W elfare State The New Deal represents a pivotal point in American social policy. If social policies in local and state jurisdictions had been the backbone of the American welfare state before 1933, the federal government became the major financer and initiator of social policy by 1938. It is true that many federal policies that were established in the New Deal were administered and funded jointly with states and employers, such as the work and relief programs, as well as Social Security and unemployment insurance. But had the federal government not financed the major portion of these joint federal–state programs, they would not have gotten off the ground, much less continued because of the inability of states to finance programs such as ADC by themselves. Even today, then, social workers who wish to intelligently refer their clients to resources and services have to be knowledgeable about programs such as Social Security and unemployment insurance, as well as distant descendants of ADC such as the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program, which was established when the AFDC program was radically revised in 1996. As we shall see in succeeding chapters, social workers also have to be knowledgeable about a host of other federal and federal–state programs that were enacted in succeeding decades. As if this challenge were not enough, social workers must also know about many local and state programs. General assistance or general relief, for example, is a descendant of poorhouses, although it provides its punitive benefits outside of residential settings. Localities and states continued those mental health, child welfare, public health, and health programs after the New Deal that they had implemented before it—even if the federal government from the 1960s onward contributed substantial resources and policy guidelines to them.

In fact, relatively few social reforms were enacted during the presidency of Harry Truman (1945–1952), and American policy was profoundly conservative during the two terms of Dwight Eisenhower (1953–1960). It was not until the presidency of John Kennedy (1961–1963) that the United States tentatively embarked on social reforms. The so-called Great Society during the administration of Lyndon Johnson (1963–1968) vastly increased the scope of the American welfare state, even if it was rudely interrupted by the Vietnam conflict. At the end of this chapter, we discuss what we can learn in contemporary society from policy advocates of the Great Society and how this era can help us better understand social policy and the structure of the American welfare state. Please access the MindTap for information about policy developments in the wake of World War II and through the 1950s that include the presidencies of Harry S. Truman and Dwight David Eisenhower. This was not a period of major social reforms, but did include considerable government assistance to construct suburbs in the wake of the war, as well as the building of the interstate highway system. It was a period of considerable prosperity. Truman was not able to enact national health legislation due to opposition from conservatives and the American Medical Association. While he was a moderate Republican, Eisenhower did not 1968 Johnson decides not to seek Democratic nomination for another term 1969 Stonewall Inn riot initiates gay rights movement attack social security. Because the United States spent huge resources on the emerging Cold War with the Soviet Union (as much as 75% of the entire federal budget), few resources were available for an expanded domestic agenda. Yet some major social problems emerged in the 1950s that were not addressed by the federal government. Seniors often lacked access to health care when they retired and no longer had health insurance. Millions of African Americans migrated to Northern and Western cities where they encountered discrimination, poverty, and poor schools. With the work-relief programs of the New Deal terminated years earlier, the United States had only a small welfare state. The stage was set for the enactment of major social reforms in the 1960s and 1970s. As you read about the late 1940s and 1950s, identify factors that impeded a major expansion of the American welfare state in this period. The Turn toward Reform Many persons wondered whether the policy quiescence of the 1950s would continue after the presidential election of 1960, which pitted Vice President Richard Nixon against Senator John Kennedy, a relatively unknown Democrat who had served in the House (1947–1952) and had been elected to the Senate in 1952. Neither man projected a reformist image; indeed, the campaign focused on the first televised presidential debates, in which the two men promised to pursue anticommunist policies. It was only when Kennedy was pitted against Hubert Humphrey, a liberal reformer, in a key primary in West Virginia that he made social reform a prominent part of his campaign; he promised to help elderly people with their medical bills, to develop programs to help Americans living in poverty in Appalachia and inner cities, and “to get the country moving again.” But his belated support of social reform and indifference to reform as a U.S. senator did not endear him to liberals, including Eleanor Roosevelt, who gave her support to him only late in the campaign. * A strange combination of affluence and poverty coexisted as the nation entered the 1960s. Several factors contributed to the postwar prosperity during the 1950s. With the economies of Japan and Europe devastated by World War II, the United States was uniquely positioned to become the major economic power in the world and to dominate world trade. Lacking economic competitors, American industry could both export at will and dominate domestic markets. * Economic growth was buoyed by rising wages, as well as funds that circulated in the economy from burgeoning Social Security and other social programs. It was also fueled by a partnership fashioned between government, the housing industry, and the automobile industry. The federal government provided cheap housing loans to veterans and other homeowners and underwrote a large share of the costs of a massive expansion of the nation’s roads, which in turn promoted a housing boom in the suburbs and the production of large numbers of automobiles. The federal government also contributed indirectly to economic growth through its tax policies by allowing Americans to deduct interest payments on home mortgages and loans. * Serious social problems existed, however. They were most obvious in the South and Southwest, where millions of African Americans, Latinos, and First Americans experienced appalling poverty, as well as violation of their fundamental rights. Although they had traditionally resided in rural areas, increasing numbers settled in urban areas, where they encountered overt discrimination; they were prevented from voting, using public facilities and transportation, and living in white neighborhoods. Even in the mid-1950s, there were signs that African Americans in the South would demand civil rights that had been denied them throughout most of American history save for a brief interlude after the Civil War when federal troops occupied the South. Leaders of African American churches, who had often been resigned to the oppression of their people, began to discuss strategies for attacking racist policies. The urbanization of African Americans in the South allowed them to organize more easily against rampant discrimination than had been possible when they mostly lived in remote rural areas. * The seeds of African American discontent in the North were sown in the 1940s and the 1950s by a massive migration from the South. African Americans fled the South for many reasons—to join friends who had already migrated to the North, to obtain jobs, or to escape oppression. (The mechanization of cotton picking caused major unemployment of African Americans in the South.) Of the 4.5 million African Americans who migrated to the North and West between 1940 and 1970, 90% settled in the large cities of six states: California, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois. * They were segregated in densely populated urban ghettoes, denied housing in white areas, limited to unskilled jobs, denied membership in unions, placed within segregated and inferior school systems, disenfranchised, and subjected to police brutality. Despite its prosperity, the nation was marked by extreme economic inequality in 1960. The average income of persons in the most affluent one- fifth of the population was roughly nine times the average income of those in the poorest one-fifth of the population. * Poverty existed in low-income urban areas and in rural areas such as Appalachia, where housing, infant mortality, health, and income standards were similar to those in many developing nations. In 1960, Social Security, unemployment insurance, and AFDC provided a very inadequate safety net. (The ADC program had been renamed the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, or AFDC, in 1950 when cash benefits were extended to mothers as well as children.) AFDC was administered arbitrarily in many jurisdictions, with flagrant violations of the rights of persons who sought assistance. * Southern states paid scandalously low benefits. Because no subsidized nutrition program existed, many individuals—including those who received miserly AFDC payments—suffered malnutrition; indeed, surveys suggested that many children in Mississippi were malnourished even as late as 1967. * Since the federal government had developed no major medical programs, poor persons had to rely on underfunded county and municipal hospitals. There were virtually no neighborhood clinics for pregnant women or infants, for family planning, or for other special needs. As government health insurance programs did not exist, millions of elderly persons found that they could not afford to pay their medical bills when they lost the private medical insurance provided as a fringe benefit by many employers in the postwar era. Social Security pensions, which were received by millions of elderly persons, had helped ease their economic burdens, but about one-third of them lived below poverty levels even in 1967. * Women first entered the labor force in large numbers during World War II when they served as replacements for male workers who had joined the military, but many of their jobs were terminated when the veterans returned. The millions of women remaining in the labor force—in clerical, check out, sales, nursing, and teaching occupations—were usually consigned to low- paying jobs and rarely given assistance with their day care needs. * Blue-collar workers contended with hazardous working conditions in chemical, plastics, pesticide, and assembly-line plants that were not subject to adequate safety regulations. Despite major gains in unionizing workers, many blue-collar workers lacked private health insurance and were forced to rely on charity medicine in public hospitals when they became seriously ill. Workers were buffeted by three recessions in the 1950s. Persons with mental illnesses, developmental disabilities, or physical disabilities encountered desperate problems. Because most jurisdictions lacked statutes that placed limits on the involuntary commitment of persons with mental disorders to institutions, many unjustified admissions were made. Persons with severe mental disorders had to be admitted to hospitals because few community programs existed for them. Their rights were rarely safeguarded within institutions, where many remained for decades with little or no treatment. Along with a growing number of poorly monitored nursing homes, mental institutions also served as repositories for older persons who had virtually no access to community-based services. * The plight of children with developmental disabilities and their families was equally desperate, because public schools often shunned this population, few community-based services existed, and parents often had no access to appropriate institutions for these children. * Persons with physical disabilities were provided with virtually no supportive assistance, other than disability assistance and inadequate health services in county and municipal hospitals. * In the 1950s, homosexuality was widely perceived as a mental problem rather than a personal orientation. As most states had statutes that defined their sexual practices as crimes, gay men and lesbians usually tried to disguise their sexual orientation to escape criminal sanctions, insensitive treatment by mental health professionals, or discrimination by employers. * Some gay men and lesbians were involuntarily committed to mental institutions by relatives who believed them to be mentally ill because of their sexual orientation. Many were fired from the federal civil service, the State Department, and the armed forces in the 1950s. * Discuss Domestic Policy during the Kennedy Administration EP 6a The lethargy of the 1950s was broken by the election in 1960 of John Kennedy, the youngest president in American history. He remains a controversial figure. Some historians and biographers portray him as a socially minded leader whose legislation was defeated because he confronted a relatively conservative Congress and public. Had he not been assassinated in 1963, they argue, he would have been reelected in 1964, would have obtained a sweeping electoral victory, and would have secured the enactment of many social reforms. * His detractors present a less flattering portrait; they contend that he was relatively conservative, possessed a limited reform vision, adopted reform causes only under strong political pressure, and enmeshed the nation in the Vietnam conflict. * A true portrayal probably lies somewhere between these two poles. Kennedy had a limited understanding of poverty and racism because he was raised in a wealthy Boston family and attended private schools. He rarely assumed leadership roles on domestic issues while he served as a Congressman and senator in the postwar era, though he dutifully voted Democratic positions on many issues. His orientations toward social reform were reflected in his ambivalence about Franklin Roosevelt. His father, a wealthy businessman, had had a conflicted relationship with Roosevelt, which ended in his resignation from a high-level position in Roosevelt’s administration. * Kennedy regarded New Deal reforms, which provided LO 7-1 economic resources and jobs to the poor, as outmoded in an affluent era when, he believed, problems of poverty involved intergenerational pockets of poverty in inner cities and rural areas. Kennedy was a problem-solving pragmatist, whose advisors were adept at using economics and management tools to analyze complex problems. But social reform requires moral outrage—and it was the absence of a gut response to social problems that alienated many liberals from Kennedy in the late 1950s and led some of them to support his presidential bid only belatedly in 1960. * Like many of his contemporaries, Kennedy accepted both cultural and structural explanations of poverty. The economic improvement of poor persons was impeded, he believed, by a culture of poverty that made them oriented toward the present, unable to defer gratification, and unwilling to perceive the utility of education. Structuralists believed that automation and technology consigned persons with few skills and little education to unemployment or dead-end jobs. In either case, remedies focused on changing poor individuals themselves, whether by providing them with different orientations or by giving them training or education. * These approaches to poverty were based on questionable assumptions. Research suggests that, though structural unemployment exists, most low- income workers are able to find work but are subject to brief periods of unemployment because they work in seasonal occupations or for firms that are particularly subject to economic cycles. Perhaps more important than structural factors are overt and covert forms of discrimination that relegate people of color and women to low-paying unskilled and semiskilled occupations and subject them to adverse hiring and promotion decisions, particularly during recessions. * The belief that poor people possess a distinctive and dysfunctional culture has also been questioned by many critics. Perspectives of poor persons often change when they receive work, which suggests that their presumed basic orientations are often adaptations to immediate situational realities. Certain attributes, such as present-orientedness, may be functional for populations that have little hope of saving money from low-paying jobs. Some critics have questioned the methodology of middle-class social scientists, whose conclusions about the different culture of poor people is sometimes derived from biased research instruments. Others have noted that many of the characteristics attributed to the poor by social scientists in the 1960s were identical to 19th-century stereotypes of paupers—and also Irish Americans and other ethnic groups—as lazy and unmotivated. Both in the 19th century and in the 1960s, many Americans condescendingly believed that poor persons would be magically transformed if they were personally exposed to middle- or upper-class persons who could teach them to be industrious. * The various explanations of poverty and unemployment that were commonly advanced in the early 1960s led to a preoccupation with policies to change people in poverty by providing them with services and training, to the neglect of policies to redistribute resources and jobs to them. Scant attention was given to public works, tax incentives to employers to hire certain kinds of workers, affirmative action, the development of a national welfare system, or redistributive tax reform. * Services, education, and job training may eventually help some persons escape poverty, but they do not help them with immediate economic needs or necessarily improve their economic condition relative to other citizens. In Kennedy’s defense, he encountered a difficult political situation in 1960. He did not receive a reform mandate from the voters when they narrowly chose him over Richard Nixon, and most Americans did not give priority, based on public opinion polls of the early 1960s, to addressing issues of poverty or racial discrimination. Kennedy’s political problems were magnified by divisions within the Democratic Party: Southern conservatives, whose support he desperately needed to defeat Republican opposition, stoutly resisted domestic reforms, whereas a group of Northern liberals, including Senator Hubert Humphrey, insisted that Kennedy develop a range of social reforms, such as executive orders and legislation to protect the rights of African Americans in the South. Caught in this political cross-fire, Kennedy tried, with marginal success, to walk a political tightrope between the two factions. Many Southern conservatives believed he was a liberal reformer who might even vigorously seek a second Reconstruction, whereas Northern liberals thought he was overconcerned with appeasing Southern Democrats. * Kennedy’s precarious political position was exacerbated by his political style. Unlike many politicians, who pride themselves on attention to legislative details, Kennedy was widely perceived by members of Congress to have been a relatively lazy legislator who missed key votes and was remiss in his legislative homework. Many powerful senior legislators also believed Kennedy had succeeded to the presidency before his rightful time and resented his disinclination to consult with them unless he absolutely needed their votes. Some politicians believed that he prematurely and fatalistically discounted his chances to win key votes. Witty, articulate, and adept at using television to his advantage, Kennedy was an entertaining president who had limited ability to convince powerful politicians to support his legislation. * Analyze Poverty and Civil Rights Kennedy can best be described in the late 1950s as a potential liberal, because his background made him receptive to social reform but reluctant to give it precedence over foreign affairs. He was pushed leftward during the Democratic presidential primaries in 1960 when he ran against Hubert Humphrey, who successfully invoked the reform tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and, in the process, portrayed Kennedy as indifferent to social issues. When Kennedy also appealed to the Roosevelt tradition to win the support of miners and other working-class voters in a pivotal West Virginia primary, he won a crucial victory and, with it, momentum that carried him eventually to the presidential nomination of his party. He realized, too, that he would have to actively pursue social reform if he wanted to keep the allegiance of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, a group that finally, if reluctantly, supported his bid for the party’s nomination. * Slow but decided shifts in public opinion facilitated Kennedy’s movement toward social reform. Poverty and other social issues were rarely discussed in the 1950s in public or private arenas; indeed, a bibliography of academic writings on the subject of poverty in 1960 totaled two pages! * The federal government had not even attempted to define poverty before the early 1960s, when it finally created a standard that is still used. In 1962, when Michael Harrington published The Other America , a book that discussed problems of the “invisible poor” in rural and urban settings, he was surprised to discover that it became a bestseller. * Academics, too, discovered the poor, as reflected by a rapidly expanding literature on the subject in the early 1960s. As the progressive and New Deal eras had demonstrated, social reform is possible in America when sizable numbers of middle-class Americans empathize with disadvantaged persons. It was the civil rights movement, however, that decisively pushed Kennedy and the nation toward social reform. It began quietly in the South in 1955, LO 7-2 when a young African American minister, Martin Luther King, Jr., was chosen by its organizers to head a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, to protest the policy that required African Americans to sit at the back of the bus. African Americans won a decisive victory when this policy was rescinded, but only after a lengthy period of tense confrontation that included sporadic acts of violence against African Americans. The bus boycott initiated a long sequence of protests that successively challenged segregation in interstate transportation, lunch counters, train stations, public swimming pools, public schools, and colleges. Involvement in these issues led, in turn, to protests against literacy tests and poll taxes that disqualified African Americans from voting in the South. Many Americans in the North began to realize that a tangled web of racist policies in the South trapped African Americans at virtually every step. The nation became further sensitized to Southern injustices as nonviolent protests of civil rights demonstrators were repeatedly countered by violence, unfair rulings by Southern courts, intimidation, and murder. * A particular murder in the summer of 1955—the killing of Emmett Till, an African American child from Chicago who was visiting relatives in Mississippi—brought the civil rights struggle of the South to the attention of African Americans in the North, as well as the mass media. * (See Figure 7.1 .) Till had been warned by his mother to be meek when dealing with Southern whites. She told him, “If you have to get on your knees and bow when a white person goes past, do it willingly.” * But Till, who had been reared in the North, bragged to several boys outside a grocery store that he had a white girlfriend in Chicago. When one of them dared him to talk to the white female storekeeper, Till bought some candy and told her, “Bye, Baby,” as he was leaving. A girl who had heard about the incident predicted, “When that lady’s husband come back, there is going to be trouble.” Three days later, after midnight on a Saturday, the white woman’s husband and his brother-in-law came to get that “boy who has done the talkin’.” * They dragged Till from the country cabin, tortured him, murdered him, and dumped his body in a river. Later, they said they had to kill him because he refused to repent or beg for mercy. When his mother saw the mutilated body, she insisted on an open-casket funeral. The picture of the body, published in an African American magazine, so shocked Chicagoans that thousands attended the funeral. The subsequent trial of the accused white slayers was equally sensational. An African American man testified against them in open court—something that rarely happened in the South because of its risks. When the all-white jury exonerated the defendants, mass rallies of African Americans occurred throughout the North. Although justice was never done in this case, Emmett Till became a martyr, and the civil rights struggle became a national movement. Ominously, however, white Southerners reacted with rage at the audacity of the African Americans who had testified against the men and at the Northern sympathy for Till. It was clear that the old South would not quickly relent. Figure 7.1.

The civil rights movement, like widespread unemployment in the Great Depression and child labor in the progressive era, provided an obvious and ongoing symbol that sensitized Americans to the needs of a particular group of people and forced political leaders to propose policy remedies. As in the 1930s when the depression did not abate, the vicious cycle of protest and repression would not disappear or yield to superficial remedies. Public opinion finally forced Kennedy to propose civil rights legislation in 1963. The escalating protest and violence in the South in the early 1960s presented Kennedy and his brother Robert, the attorney general, with a dilemma. Kennedy needed the votes of Southern Democrats if the rest of his domestic and foreign policies were to be enacted, but he also needed the support of liberal Democrats, who were urging him to support federal civil rights legislation or, at the very least, to issue executive orders that prohibited job discrimination in federally funded projects. Kennedy tried for several years to follow a middle course. * He gave African Americans and liberals a symbolic victory when he created a presidential task force headed by Vice President Lyndon Johnson, but it made little progress in addressing discrimination against African Americans in employment. Though Robert Kennedy used federal marshals and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents to protect demonstrators in the South, he avoided the use of federal troops, even in the face of rapidly mounting violence, and insisted, moreover, that Southern jurisdictions were capable of protecting civil rights demonstrators, despite the obvious hostility of many Southern police chiefs. Kennedy refused to issue executive orders to outlaw discrimination or to develop federal civil rights legislation because both he and his brother were convinced that the failure of Reconstruction was due to the imposition of civil rights policies on the South by the North. * They also naively hoped that civil rights legislation could be enacted by Southern states as more African Americans became enfranchised. Kennedy’s middle course was successful in 1961 and much of 1962. Southerners believed that Robert Kennedy had not used federal marshals except as a last resort, and most African Americans believed that the Kennedy brothers protected them from white extremists. Some policy successes were obtained, even as violence escalated. Directives from the Interstate Commerce Commission to desegregate bus and train stations were met with compliance and the support of Southern police departments. But events soon made African Americans, liberals, and many Northerners realize that aggressive federal intervention was needed. Robert Kennedy had hoped that the civil rights protesters would focus on voting rights rather than on desegregation of public facilities and schools because he thought registering African Americans to vote would be less likely to arouse a violent response and would eventually liberalize Southern politics. * When the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) brought thousands of white students to work alongside African Americans in registering voters in 1962 and 1963, however, activists were greeted with threats, intimidation, and physical violence. Many other civil rights groups took prominent roles in the movement, including the Congress of Racial Equality, the National Association of Colored Persons, and the Council for United Civil Rights Leadership. Many Southern authorities assumed a passive role, overlooked violence, or jailed activists. The mass media were filled with accounts of Southern atrocities, but Northern opinion was most aroused, African Americans ruefully noted, when white students or activists were murdered in voter registration drives. * Resistance by high-level Southern politicians to federal court orders to desegregate universities further angered Northerners. As violence increased, liberals introduced a series of civil rights bills in the Congress and demanded support from Kennedy. Despite protests by some of his top advisors, Kennedy finally decided in 1963 to propose his own civil rights legislation, which prohibited job discrimination on the basis of race and gender as well as discrimination in voter registration. * To make the legislation acceptable to moderates in both parties, he diluted voting provisions. In June of 1963, he gave a televised address to endorse the legislation, which was, sadly, the first presidential address in the nation’s history devoted to civil rights issues. When Senator Everett Dirksen and other Republicans decided to join Northern Democrats, the legislation appeared destined for passage, but the ill-fated Kennedy could not claim credit for it because of his tragic death in November 1963. Identify Failures and Success during the Course of Reform EP 8a EP 9b Kennedy promised in the 1960 campaign that he would support aid to education and medical insurance for older Americans, but both his medical and educational proposals became enmeshed in ideological controversy. Although European nations had developed national health insurance schemes, many Americans believed that governmental financing of medical care would threaten the doctor–patient relationship and was, moreover, un- American. The American Medical Association led the opposition to any major federal programs, including public funding of inoculations, and was aided by disputes among legislators about financing and program details. Some legislators wanted to fund medical assistance to older Americans from Social Security payroll deductions, but others wanted to use a separate payroll tax or general revenues. Some legislators favored voluntary participation, and others wanted to make participation mandatory. Various legislative proposals went nowhere, although some progress had been made in congressional deliberations by the summer of 1963. * As the nation’s first Catholic president, Kennedy did not want to appear to favor parochial schools. When he excluded religious and private schools from funding under his education bill, however, he incited the wrath of the Catholic Church, which insisted that parochial schools receive funds as LO 7-3 well. Kennedy’s subsequent concessions to them emboldened Catholic leaders, as well as leaders of other denominations, to demand even more funds for their schools, to the chagrin of legislators who wanted to preserve strict separation of church and state. Passage seemed hopeless. * Some economists believed that periodic recessions, pockets of unemployment, and low rates of economic growth were caused by inadequate pools of investment capital. Guided by economist Walter Heller, Kennedy proposed to increase depreciation allowances for businesses and to allow a tax credit for investments. These policies, which were enacted in 1962, were overshadowed by another proposal to drastically reduce the rates of taxes paid by businesses and wealthy persons. The bill encountered substantial opposition from conservatives, who feared that the tax cut could lead to government deficits. When Kennedy died, the legislation had passed in the House, but not in the Senate. Judged in purely economic terms, Kennedy’s tax measures probably spurred investment and economic growth; but from the vantage point of the poor and the working class, the policies contributed to economic inequality in the nation and drew attention from the need to reform the tax code so as to eliminate deductions and loopholes that benefited affluent taxpayers. * Moreover, as we will later note, they reduced the funds available for social programs in the Johnson administration, when the Vietnam conflict absorbed increasing resources. Believing that many unemployed persons could not find work because they lacked the necessary skills, Kennedy proposed and obtained passage of the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 (MDTA); 600,000 workers had completed technical training by 1968, but the program was plagued by problems. * The dropout rate was high, the skills taught were not always needed in local job markets, and relocation assistance was limited. Some critics contend that job-training programs allow one group of trained workers to displace nontrained workers if new jobs are not simultaneously created. * MDTA nonetheless represented the nation’s first major job-training program since the work relief programs of the New Deal had not focused on training. Kennedy sought and obtained major increases in the minimum wage, partly at the behest of unions, which hoped that this measure would deter companies from moving to the nonunionized and low-wage South. * Its supporters contended that it provided a wage floor for those workers—in particular, unskilled African American workers—who were severely underpaid compared with other workers, but some economists believe that it fostered unemployment by spurring employers to decrease the size of their labor forces. * Kennedy established the Area Redevelopment Agency in 1961 to increase employment in depressed rural areas such as Appalachia by providing loans and subsidies to local businesses and by improving transportation systems. * Critics contend that the program created few jobs because its subsidies were too low or were targeted to tourism and other businesses that employed relatively few persons. Marred by political favoritism and corruption, the program was terminated in 1965. * The concerns of a number of mental health experts about the absence of community-based care for persons who had been released from mental hospitals led Congress to establish a commission in 1955. The commission’s report, Action for Mental Health , which was issued in 1961, recommended federal funding of community-based mental health services. Kennedy secured the enactment of the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963, which provided federal funding for the construction of mental health centers that offered a range of outpatient and preventive services. The act was quickly amended to provide funds for staff as well. Because appropriations for the legislation never met the expectations of its framers, it did not address all the community needs of mental patients, who often lived in substandard board-and-care facilities and skid-row housing. * It nonetheless led to the establishment of a national network of centers that provided outpatient services to millions of people. Many Americans were alarmed by the marked expansion of AFDC rolls in the early 1960s. In response, a services strategy was formulated in 1962 to cut the rolls through interventions of social workers. In this strategy, the federal government provided a 75% match to the states to encourage local welfare departments to provide social services to AFDC recipients. It was, at best, a naive proposal. The growth in AFDC rolls was the result of many factors, including migration of poor African Americans to urban areas in the North and the South, the absence of jobs for unskilled female workers, and the absence of day care. Furthermore, since rates of desertion by fathers are associated with social class, they are unlikely to decline unless jobs and resources are provided to low-income families. The rapid rise of AFDC rolls provided conservatives with the opportunity to propose punitive policies. * Kennedy missed an opportunity to develop a variety of tax, income, and nutritional programs to reduce poverty. Moreover, convinced that the nation needed the capability to fight the Soviet Union, China, and one guerilla war at the same time to counter communist insurgency, he launched the fastest peacetime buildup of the military in American history and introduced military advisors into South Vietnam in an expansion of the military budget that constrained social spending (see Insert 7.1 ). * Insert 7.1. Critical Analysis: The Limits of Social Services Social workers have often been asked to solve problems by working directly with populations most affected by social problems, whether women on AFDC (as in the case of the services strategy of 1962), children who have been abused, homeless people, or mental patients. Yet the dilemmas of these clients are often profoundly shaped by economic factors, community factors, and family dynamics that the social worker cannot control. Most children who are reported as abused, for example, come from low-income families, where unemployment (or underemployment) is a stressor that may cause or exacerbate the abuse. Analyze options that exist for social workers in these circumstances in their direct work with these clients with respect to policy-sensitive practice, as we discussed in Chapters 1 and 2 . Also discuss how they might use micro, mezzo, or macro policy advocacy. Kennedy deserves praise, however, for shattering the conservative complacency that characterized the 1950s. He came to office with no mandate to enact major reforms and inherited a Congress in which Republicans and Southern Democrats possessed a majority. Although unable to secure passage of most of his major social legislation, he established a policy agenda for his successor, Lyndon Johnson: civil rights legislation, the War on Poverty, the Food Stamp Program, Medicare, federal aid to public schools, and tax reform. Kennedy and Johnson: A Study in Contrasts A novelist could not have fashioned a more unusual plot. The articulate and well-educated Kennedy, fearing lack of support from pivotal Southern delegates at the 1960 Democratic convention, chose Lyndon Johnson, a crude and politically astute Southerner, as his vice president, over the strenuous objections of Robert Kennedy. Political pundits saw it as a brilliant move to obtain the support of Southern Democrats. Who could have predicted that most of Kennedy’s social legislation would eventually be enacted by Johnson, or that Johnson would carry the Vietnam policy that Kennedy had begun to its tragic conclusion? Johnson excelled in political maneuvering. His grandfather and father had been involved in a strange mixture of populist and conservative Texas politics. His mother, an aristocratic figure unfulfilled in her marriage to an alcoholic Texan, urged him to rise above his humble origins. As early as college, when he was active in campus politics, Johnson displayed an uncanny ability to decipher the existing balance of political forces and to develop issues that could propel him into leadership roles. After a brief stint as a teacher, he became an aide to a congressman, secured an appointment as regional director in Texas of a major New Deal program, and successfully ran for Congress. * On his second attempt, in 1948, Johnson was elected to the United States Senate, where he quickly became a protégé of Senator Richard Russell, a powerful legislator. By helping Russell with laborious details and serving as his confidante, Johnson cleverly positioned himself to run for the position of Senate minority leader, to which he was elected in 1953. In January 1955, when Democrats won control of the Senate, he became majority leader. He became an expert in the intricacies of parliamentary procedures, honed his interpersonal and persuasive skills, and augmented his power by vesting in the majority leader the power to make committee assignments. * He had presidential ambitions but was not well known outside Texas and the Senate. Realizing that he could not advance beyond his position as majority leader, he accepted Kennedy’s invitation to be vice president in 1960. He was deeply frustrated by 1963, however, because he was seldom consulted by Kennedy or his Ivy League staff. We can scarcely imagine how he felt when he learned, in a Dallas hospital, that Kennedy was dead and that he would soon be the nation’s next president. The Johnson administration achieved legislative successes that were matched only by those of Franklin Roosevelt: major federal resources allocated to public schools for the first time in history, medical insurance for the elderly, subsidies for health care of the poor, legal aid for the poor, job training for impoverished teenagers, enforcement of civil rights for African Americans, nutritional programs, preschool programs, community development projects, health care for migrant labor, and medical services for pregnant women and children. Although Franklin Roosevelt had succeeded in developing federal income and insurance programs for economic security, Johnson extended federal programs into areas that had fallen outside the province of federal policy. His legislative successes can be explained by a combination of facilitating factors. When Kennedy died, many of his policy proposals were making their way through the legislative process. Kennedy provided Johnson with an instant agenda, which facilitated his legislative tasks. * Johnson was aided, moreover, by sustained pressure from civil rights groups. Violent reprisals against civil rights demonstrators, who continued to protest, inflamed public opinion in the North, which became more sympathetic not only to African Americans but to the plight of poor persons. Nor should we ignore Johnson’s genuine compassion for those in need. It is always difficult to determine motivation when examining the actions of politicians; this was particularly so with Johnson, who possessed much political ambition and was obsessed with personal failure. Did he pursue his policy agenda to obtain a high reputation, or did he genuinely seek to help people with problems? No doubt Johnson, like most politicians, had mixed motives, but one of his closest aides, Joseph Califano, argues persuasively that Johnson often had noble motives that derived from his populist origins. * In any event, Johnson was driven to seek social reforms, spent incalculable hours writing legislation, and repeatedly brought himself to the point of exhaustion in seeking its enactment. Johnson used his political skills to his advantage. He immediately wrapped himself in the mantle of Kennedy by promising to enact Kennedy’s legislative measures and by keeping his top staff. By portraying himself as a humble successor to Kennedy who would devote himself tirelessly to the fulfillment of the slain leader’s unfulfilled aspirations, he endeared himself to the American people as well as to legislators. He summoned to the White House virtually every legislator, lobbyist, interest group leader, and citizen who could advance the progress of Kennedy’s pending legislation. He obtained detailed information about their policy opinions, specific legislative objectives that they desired, and their willingness to compromise on key points. He assembled, in effect, a massive team to develop a legislative program in support of his domestic measures. * Johnson was a welcome change to congressional leadership because he discussed specific pieces of legislation with them before the legislation was introduced to Congress. He was adept, as well, at giving legislators credit for specific pieces of legislation during the legislative process and at signing ceremonies. He bridged the chasm between the White House and Congress, which had sabotaged Kennedy’s legislation. Johnson maintained political support from a broad spectrum of legislators and interest groups. * Many liberals, including Robert Kennedy, feared that, as a Southerner, Johnson would develop conservative policies, but Johnson dashed these fears when he declared his allegiance to Kennedy’s entire legislative package, including civil rights. Indeed, his decisive commitment to civil rights, which he made almost immediately on succeeding to the presidency, was a remarkably bold move that signaled to Southerners, as it did to Northern liberals, that he would be a reform-minded president. Yet he was also adept at giving concessions to Southerners, as reflected by provisions in many pieces of legislation that gave Southern states a disproportionate amount of program funds by weighting their distribution to poorer states. (Southern states had the lowest per capita incomes in the United States.) He carefully cultivated support from both unions and businesses; he supported increases in the minimum wage, favored by unions, and he vigorously sought passage of Kennedy’s tax cuts for businesses and individuals. His ability to appeal to both conservative and liberal audiences was illustrated by his support for both budget cutting and social reform. He prided himself on fiscal conservatism; he sometimes proposed cuts in the federal budget that exceeded those desired by House Republicans, and he blocked efforts by liberals to drastically expand funding for the War on Poverty, the Food Stamp Program (currently known as Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program [SNAP]), or the AFDC program. Yet he supported passage of a staggering number of social reforms and would brag, much like a fisherman who has had a good day, about the sheer number of programs that he had enacted. * Johnson was a master of timing, negotiation, and compromise. Since he knew that momentum was crucial, he carefully introduced his legislation each year in a planned sequence, beginning with the easiest and ending with the most difficult. He made skillful compromises in legislation to defuse opposition yet astutely avoided an image of softness by refusing to back down when he believed that vital principles were at stake or that compromises would make him appear overly timid. When he rewarded politicians with patronage and resources for their districts, it was not for votes on specific issues, which would have led them to expect rewards every time they supported measures, but rather for a pattern of support over an extended period. He had an uncanny ability to make slight changes in the wording of legislation so as to mollify objections of legislators or interest groups—but his compromises would be limited only to those changes that were necessary for passage. * Johnson knew that his political honeymoon with the public would end and feared that his legislative successes would also come to a halt. However, he received extraordinary assistance from the Republicans when they nominated Barry Goldwater in 1964 to be their presidential candidate. The conservative Goldwater presented an easy target for Johnson when he violated the unspoken rule in American politics that legacies of the New Deal, such as Social Security and the Tennessee Valley Authority, would be placed above partisan politics. Because Goldwater both espoused foreign intervention against communist regimes and hinted that he might consider use of tactical nuclear weapons in such struggles, Johnson portrayed himself as a man of peace—a claim that still seemed plausible because he had not yet committed thousands of troops to Vietnam. * Enough liberal and moderate Democrats were elected in the landslide victory of 1964 that Johnson’s legislative program could not be scuttled by the conservative coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats. He proceeded to use this mandate to enact Kennedy’s pending legislation, as well as many proposals developed by his numerous task forces, under the rubric of the Great Society. Evaluate Johnson’ s Policy Gluttony EP 1a For all his political skills, Johnson had a fatal personal flaw: policy gluttony. He wanted to be the most successful domestic and international president in American history—to exceed even Franklin Roosevelt’s accomplishments at home and abroad. He also wanted to have bipartisan support from both liberals and conservatives. His presidency would be, he hoped, a Texas barbecue with everyone attending and thanking the host as they left. Imbued with this mind-set, Johnson risked overreaching by selecting incompatible goals. Might an aggressive foreign policy undercut his domestic reforms? Might huge tax cuts at the inception of his presidency— certain to be popular with many liberals and conservatives—deplete resources for both his foreign and domestic policies—making both conservatives and liberals unhappy? Could he maintain a coalition of supporters with these different policies in play? LO 7-4 Johnson’ s Fateful First Choice At the time of Kennedy’s death, a huge tax cut was pending in the Congress that would have cut most taxpayers’ taxes by more than 20%. Rather than slowing the tax cut’s momentum as he pondered whether the United States could afford it, as well as his impending social and military initiatives, Johnson sought and got its immediate passage. He did this, however, only by promising congressional conservatives that he would not increase the national budget until tax revenues returned to their former precut levels. This decision meant that his administration would be strapped for cash as it eventually sought to fund both its domestic and international policies, which came to include the Great Society and the Vietnam conflict. When he did increase spending even before tax revenues exceeded the precut levels, conservatives became infuriated with him, accused him of breaking his promise, and demanded domestic spending cuts. In turn, liberals complained that his Great Society was poorly funded because too many resources went to the Vietnam conflict. When asked after he left the presidency what his biggest mistake had been, he answered, “The tax cut of 1964.” We shall see in subsequent chapters how huge tax cuts in 1981, 2001, and 2003 greatly depleted domestic resources, particularly when coupled with rapidly growing military expenditures; see Insert 7.2 . Insert 7.2. Ethical Analysis: Linkages between Taxes and Social Policy Few social policy theorists discuss taxes in their writings; they focus instead on policy enactments and social programs. But social programs are ultimately funded by tax revenues, whether from general taxes or from payroll taxes. As a proportion of income, taxes in the United States are far lower than in European nations, where higher rates of taxation on personal incomes are supplemented by a value-added tax that far exceeds local sales taxes in the United States. In the context of U.S. history, what cultural and political factors promote Americans’ distaste for taxes? What implications have low taxes had for social policy expenditures, particularly when the United States has also spent a far larger share (in comparison with European nations) of its domestic wealth on military programs? Did multi-trillion-dollar tax cuts during the presidency of George W. Bush affect domestic policy, particularly when coupled—as in the Johnson administration—with sharp increases in military spending that accompanied the war against Iraq? Can an ethical argument be made that inadequate taxation is a breach of social justice not just in the 1960s but in 2017 and 2018 when President Donald Trump seeks to cut taxes of affluent Americans when many domestic discretionary programs are poorly funded? Should affluent Americans often have lower tax rates after they use numerous tax loopholes than less affluent Americans? Johnson’s Fateful Second Choice As early as 1964, Johnson met secretly with foreign policy advisors such as Robert McNamara, Dean Rusk, and McGeorge Bundy to consider what he should do with respect to Vietnam. While President Kennedy had committed a relatively small group of “advisors” to Vietnam to provide military consultation to the Vietnamese government, he had refrained from committing large numbers of American troops to a complex political struggle in Vietnam. In 1954, the Geneva Treaty had divided Vietnam into two nations: a Northern communist regime and a Southern noncommunist nation. A three-sided conflict soon emerged: North Vietnam versus South Vietnam, and insurgents in South Vietnam versus the entrenched government in South Vietnam. This conflict escalated into a civil war. The battle between North and South Vietnam got most attention in the mass media. Ho Chi Minh, the diminutive leader of North Vietnam, was determined to reunite Vietnam under communist leadership—and began steady infiltration of South Vietnam with the goal of toppling the government in South Vietnam. But a civil war had also broken out in South Vietnam because many insurgents believed the South Vietnamese government was corrupt and uninterested in land reforms that could benefit impoverished peasants. As a hawkish anticommunist president, John Kennedy feared that a victory by Ho Chi Minh would not only make Vietnam a united communist nation, but would catalyze similar communist victories in other Asian nations in a so-called domino effect. But he realized that Vietnam provided unfavorable jungle terrain for military action against communist forces—and he knew that the regime in South Vietnam was corrupt and insensitive to the needs of its citizens. Why, he sometimes wondered, drag American troops into the middle of a civil war? So he hedged his bets by only committing military advisors to South Vietnam while waiting to decide whether to commit American troops to the conflict. It is unclear what he would have done had he not been assassinated. Lyndon Johnson, by contrast, decided in his talks with advisors in the summer of 1964 to commit large numbers of American troops to Vietnam, but he chose not to tell the public about his decision until after the presidential elections of 1964 were completed. Ironically, he ran as a man of peace against Barry Goldwater, whom he portrayed as a man of war. This decision to go to war—eventually committing more than 500,000 American troops to Vietnam—when combined with his tax cut and his expansive domestic agenda, would have catastrophic consequences for his presidency. Johnson’s Fateful Third Choice As his third choice, Johnson decided to go all-out in enacting domestic reforms even in 1964—but even more ambitiously in 1965 were he to win the election of 1964 decisively and get large Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress. Even with the fiscal constraints that he faced, Johnson secured the enactment of a prodigious number of domestic measures that greatly expanded the role of the federal government in social policy. Assess Civil Rights Legislation in 1964 and 1965 EP 3a Johnson refused to compromise with Southerners in 1964 when they tried to dilute civil rights legislation drafted by the Kennedy administration. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a historic measure; it marked the first time since Reconstruction that the federal government had assumed a major role in protecting the voting rights of African Americans in the South. The act required the desegregation of public facilities and prohibited discrimination in the hiring practices of firms and institutions that received federal contracts. The U.S. attorney general was also given the right to file suits to desegregate schools. The immediate effects of this legislation were diminished because litigation was often required to bring compliance, but within six months it led to a civil rights revolution for African Americans in the South. Public accommodations and public transportation were desegregated by 1965. The attorney general initiated suits against local school districts that discriminated against African Americans and supported an ever-tightening series of guidelines that ultimately required them to use one set of facilities for all students. It was an extraordinary set of achievements by any standard. Southern whites found they were unable to persuade the Supreme Court to overrule federal civil rights powers, as had occurred during Reconstruction. The Department of Justice, often headed by officials who LO 7-5 questioned various aspects of civil rights legislation, did not attack its central provisions. * The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was flawed in several important respects, however. It outlawed the use of literacy tests, but the tedious case-by-case enforcement process allowed many jurisdictions to continue discriminatory practices. Johnson did not aggressively implement Title VII of the act, which outlawed discrimination in employment; for example, he failed to give the Department of Labor a significant role in monitoring federal contracts for discrimination. Title VII established an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to monitor discrimination in employment, but the commission did not receive the power to initiate suits until 1972. Furthermore, Johnson decided for political reasons not to aggressively attack de facto segregation of Northern schools. * Johnson had not planned to introduce additional civil rights legislation in 1965, but he changed his mind when confronted with massive civil rights protests directed at continuing and widespread denial of suffrage to African Americans in the South. To allow faster legal action than had been possible in case-by-case litigation, the Civil Rights Act of 1965 gave the federal government the right to presume discrimination in any state or its subdivisions where less than 50% of people of color voted in federal elections and in areas that used literacy or other screening tests. In such areas, federal authorities were allowed to directly administer elections. These policies were remarkably successful in diminishing overt discrimination in voter registration. * Earl W arren and the Supreme Court Buttress Johnson’ s Domestic Agenda The Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren between 1953 and 1969, provided its own impetus to the advancement of civil rights and civil liberties. Warren had been governor of California and an important Republican politician who had, moreover, taken a number of conservative positions in California; indeed, as the state’s attorney general, he had even assumed a key role in incarcerating Japanese Americans in World War II. Eisenhower, looking for a prominent Republican and owing a political debt to Warren, felt he would be an ideal conservative choice when he appointed him chief justice in 1953. But Eisenhower had misread his man; Warren believed, above all, in the doctrine of fairness. Guided by that doctrine, he presided over a Court that in 16 years made a series of liberal rulings that radically transformed American jurisprudence. (Years later, Eisenhower believed the appointment of Warren was his biggest political error; he was not on speaking terms with Warren in the closing years of his presidency.) * The precedent-shaking nature of the Warren Court began almost at the outset, with the historic Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954. Reverend Oliver Brown of Topeka, Kansas, had brought suit against his city’s board of education because his child had to take a bus to the other side of town when a school reserved for whites was much closer. Thurgood Marshall of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) argued that segregation had such harmful psychological effects on people of color that the mere fact of segregation meant inferior education. He and other civil rights attorneys had been impressed by some experiments conducted by the African American social scientist Kenneth Clark. In tests with African American children in the North, Clark found that, when asked to identify a doll that most resembled themselves (by color), many African American children refused to answer or would cry and run out of the room. When the same test was given to African American children in the South, Clark found a different, but equally disturbing, result; the children would often point to the brown doll and say, matter-of-factly, “That’s a nigger. I’m a nigger,” thus accepting as given their subordinate status. * Although some of the civil rights lawyers did not want to use this “soft” evidence, Marshall and others prevailed; they felt that the Court would not hold segregated facilities to be a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution without it. By contrast, the attorney representing the board of education contended that no definitive proof had been shown that segregated students fare worse in life because of their segregation. Were the court to rule in Marshall’s behalf, it would repudiate more than 50 years of tradition stemming from the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896, which had upheld the separate-but-equal doctrine. What was at stake was the very structure of education in many Southern jurisdictions, which established so-called dual school systems, one for white students and the other for African American students—and possibly, further down the judicial road, the structure of Northern education, which had dual systems based not on law but on the combination of neighborhood schools and residential segregation. In the North, thanks to this system, vast numbers of children of color went to de facto segregated schools. Warren, who was appointed chief justice after the deliberations on the Brown case had been underway for many months, decided he wanted a unanimous ruling and finally got one that upheld the logic of the NAACP and gave due weight to the psychological testimony derived from Clark’s work. * Other rulings, some almost as controversial, followed in rapid succession— rulings that forced localities to reapportion voting districts to protect voting rights of minorities; to respect the rights of apprehended criminal suspects; to protect the rights of persons with radical beliefs; to give procedural protections to persons on death row; to enhance the power of the press; to strike down state laws that outlawed interracial sexual relations and marriage; to require the provision of public defenders to impoverished defendants; and to overturn laws that prohibited the sale of contraceptives. The cumulative effects of these and other rulings were enormous. Many conservatives, infuriated by these rulings, sought to develop a grassroots campaign to impeach Warren and hoped that, one day, conservative presidents would make appointments that would turn the Court into a conservative institution (see Insert 7.3 ). Insert 7.3. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies Some public officials maintain that justices on the Supreme Court are legal technicians who merely interpret the Constitution and legal precedents from the perspective of the founding fathers. As you read about these historic rulings of the Warren Court, would you argue, instead, that the justices also or even primarily used ethical reasoning to reach their conclusions? Should the ethical orientations of justices be a key consideration by the Senate in selecting them? Analyze Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act in 1965 An ingenious compromise fashioned by the administration and Wilbur Mills, powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, facilitated the passage of Medicare and Medicaid programs in 1965 as Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act. Medicare received widespread attention because of the political clout of elderly persons and the extensive discussion of their needs in preceding years. Kennedy’s desire to obtain health insurance had been frustrated by controversy about details of the program, but Mills and Johnson developed a strategy that incorporated facets of the proposals by members of both parties. * The program was divided into two parts. Participation in Part A, which funded selected hospital services of elderly persons, was mandatory and financed by a payroll tax on workers and employers. Participation in Part B was voluntary. Part B financed physicians’ services and was funded by a combination of monthly premiums on elderly persons and funds from the general revenues of the federal government. Medicare was a godsend to many elderly persons, who lacked funds to pay for their medical bills without selling their personal possessions. Because the legislation made eligibility automatic on payment of payroll taxes and premiums, elderly persons were able to receive assistance without the stigma of a means test. They did not have to visit local welfare departments but obtained eligibility through Social Security offices. It is difficult to evaluate the effect of Medicare on the health and health practices of elderly persons on account of conflicting findings and methodological issues. For example, because most elderly persons participate in Medicare, it is difficult to assess whether they would have been more or less healthy without it. However, the program appears to have increased the utilization of physicians and hospitals by poor persons, who had often refrained from LO 7-6 seeking medical care except in emergencies. Had the Medicare program not existed, it is likely that much greater numbers of elderly people would have become insolvent and forced onto welfare rolls. Another factor is that, prior to Medicare, some medical care was donated to impoverished elderly persons by doctors and hospitals; with the passage of Medicare, such donations were reduced. * Medicare can be criticized on several grounds. Since it subsidized acute health care services, it provided only a limited buffer against medical insolvency and did not help persons with chronic conditions. It reimbursed only a maximum of 60 days in the hospital, covered only 100 days of convalescent care, and did not reimburse out-of-hospital nursing home care. These restrictive policies meant that many elderly persons who exhausted their scanty Medicare benefits had to suffer the indignity of depleting their savings and assets to become eligible for Medicaid, which is a means-tested program. * At the insistence of the American Medical Association, physicians were allowed to charge higher rates for Medicare than the maximum fees that authorities would reimburse, and so elderly persons had to contribute their own resources. Studies reveal that these costs, plus various other out-of- pocket costs for services covered and not covered by Medicare, meant that elderly persons in 1986 financed nearly the same percentage of their total medical costs as before its passage. * Elderly persons’ out-of-pocket medical costs would have risen even more rapidly without the assistance of Medicare, however, because of the increasing use of expensive medical technologies and sharp increases in the real cost of medical services. Medicare contributed to medical inflation by reimbursing providers at prevailing rates, so that they had no incentive to decrease their charges or to curtail unnecessary surgeries. * Because, in line with the disease model of medicine, it was confined to financing existing curative services, Medicare did not promote innovative alternatives to nursing home care, failed to foster preventive services for elderly persons, and did not provide outreach services to the frail elderly. * In short, Medicare funded conventional services for a population that needed innovative programs, and it covered only a small fraction of their medical needs. We now turn to Medicaid. State, county, and municipal officials had funded medical services to poor persons for decades but with considerable assistance from physicians who donated their time. The costs of these programs had steadily increased, and many poor persons delayed treatment because they had no access to such services. The Medicaid program was enacted in 1965 to address the medical needs of welfare recipients, as well as so-called medically indigent persons, who, though not destitute, could not pay their medical bills. Although Medicare vested financing, administration, and policy roles in the federal government, Medicaid was a matching grant program, like AFDC, in which federal authorities paid a substantial share of the medical services but ceded major administrative and policy roles to the states. States had to provide some basic services, such as outpatient and emergency care, had to enroll AFDC recipients, and were allowed to decide which, if any, additional services they wanted to provide and to devise eligibility criteria. As in the AFDC program, conservative and poor states covered fewer services and had more restrictive eligibility criteria than other states. * Many legislators wrongly assumed that Medicaid would be a small program that would focus on the medical needs of AFDC recipients. Governors of New York and California, who had already been pressured to devise health insurance programs, believed that they could use the relatively generous federal match of the Medicaid program to develop free health services for their blue-collar citizens as well; indeed, at one point, 40% of the population in New York State was eligible for its Medicaid program. As congressional legislators observed the mounting federal costs of the Medicaid program and realized that a disproportionate share of federal funds went to a few liberal states, they enacted policies in 1967 that would restrict Medicaid coverage in all states by 1970 to persons who earned no more than 133% of a state’s AFDC standard. * It is difficult to gauge the precise effects of Medicaid on poor persons. Their use of outpatient services increased dramatically, and rural residents similarly increased their use of all medical services. Although Medicaid funding led many physicians and hospitals to discontinue free or low-cost services to poor persons, the total number of services available to the poor increased. * Nonetheless, Medicaid can be criticized in much the same way as Medicare. It encouraged inflation by infusing massive resources into the medical system with few cost controls. It did not encourage the development of innovative outreach and preventive services to poor persons, who often distrusted medical authorities or postponed treatment until illnesses had become severe. Few poor persons entered the medical system used by middle-class Americans, as regular medical providers, resenting the restrictive levels of reimbursement that most states established, refused to serve Medicaid recipients. (More than 70% of physicians refused to serve them even in 2000.) Many poor persons were served by Medicaid mills, where physicians reaped large profits from high- volume services. Two systems of care continued after the passage of Medicaid: middle-class Americans used nonprofit or for-profit hospitals, and low-income and medically indigent persons used public hospitals and inner-city clinics. * Another program to aid elderly people, the Older Americans Act (OAA), passed Congress in 1965. Under Title III, it authorized the development of a national network of Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) to coordinate services for elderly people. * Since its inception, OAA has subsidized many kinds of services, including nutritional programs, services for the homebound frail elderly, and training programs. Critics contend that AAAs, which were supposed to be vigorous advocates, have often been preoccupied with delivering services. * Analyze Federal Aid to Education in 1965 Kennedy’s proposals to extend federal aid to public schools had foundered on constitutional and political issues associated with the relationship between church and state, but Johnson fashioned a clever compromise that eventually led to passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). * It provided federal assistance to public schools with relatively high concentrations of low-income children, and it allowed private schools to share books and other materials that had been purchased by public schools. Sharp differentials in educational spending at the local level between affluent and poor neighborhoods persisted even after ESEA was enacted. Its provision of funds with relatively few restrictions led many schools to use the funds to underwrite their regular expenses rather than to upgrade the instruction of low-income students; indeed, some jurisdictions even reduced their level of educational spending after they received ESEA funds. * Gaps in educational achievement between middle- and upper-income students and low-income students continue to defy solution. Are the gaps due to poor facilities, poor instruction, or familial background? Do low-income children often discontinue school because they believe it will not lead to jobs? What combination of outreach, instructional, facility, and other changes is needed to help low-income students improve their educational performance? * Johnson also developed a range of educational subsidies for low-income persons who sought junior college and college education. * Despite the shortcomings of ESEA and other legislation, striking educational gains were made by African Americans in the 1960s at both secondary and college levels. * LO 7-7 Review the War on Poverty in 1964 and Succeeding Years When Kennedy realized in early 1963 that his domestic policy was stumbling, he commissioned top aides to develop an antipoverty program, but they had only begun assembling lists of job-training and youth employment schemes when he died. The so-called War on Poverty was developed after his death and consisted of a collection of job-training, youth employment, and medical services that various government departments had failed to enact during the Kennedy administration. * Specifically, the legislation included the Job Corps, to provide impoverished youth with job training in urban and rural residential centers; the Neighborhood Youth Corps, to provide teenagers with employment in local agencies; a legal aid program to provide free legal assistance to the poor; and medical clinics in low-income areas. The measure also included a community action program that established local community action agencies (CAAs) to coordinate local programs for the poor and to fund and operate various programs. (The popular Head Start program for preschool children was funded from community action funds.) To coordinate these programs, the legislation set up the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO); Robert Sargent Shriver, Jr., was its energetic director. The community action program soon became the most controversial part of OEO. One group of officials believed the CAAs would concentrate on planning and coordinating functions in poverty areas. Another group, which included Richard Boone and David Hackett, believed that existing programs and agencies were unresponsive to poor persons and wanted the CAAs to be forceful advocates. To increase this likelihood, they placed in the legislation the requirement that the CAAs promote the “maximum feasible participation of the poor” in their governing boards. * Virtually no legislators noticed this phrase, but it was widely used by community LO 7-8 activists in succeeding years to insist that poor persons be allowed to elect community representatives to the CAA boards. Johnson and Shriver wanted OEO programs implemented as rapidly as possible because they realized that demonstrable results were needed if the programs were to appeal to a wide spectrum of legislators. However, the speedy implementation of dozens of different programs, as well as the administratively complex CAAs, led to widespread charges of corruption, patronage, and inefficiency. * In the early planning of OEO, administration officials hoped to focus on demonstration programs in a limited number of cities, but Johnson insisted on broader coverage to enhance the visibility and impact of OEO. OEO was plagued, moreover, with incessant charges and countercharges as well as by local confusion about the objectives of the CAAs. There have been many criticisms of OEO. It was not wise to suggest that a War on Poverty could be declared, waged, and won with a collection of small programs that were supplemented by an ill-defined advocacy program. It is impossible to wage even a limited action against poverty if no income or resources are given to the poor, but OEO provided only personal and community services. When Sargent Shriver sought to include public works within OEO, he received a chilly reception from Johnson, who believed that services, training, and coordination could somehow end poverty without income transfers or creation of new jobs. * Policy expectations were established that could not be fulfilled, and political opponents criticized the limited effectiveness of OEO in reducing poverty and demanded its curtailment or elimination. Moreover, it is not politically feasible for governments to directly subsidize local protest organizations, even if the concept appears attractive at first glance. Governmental officials who are the targets of such protests will attack the advocacy program as unwarranted federal intrusion into local affairs; many of those officials will be powerful mayors who constitute a significant part of the political constituency of the Democratic Party. Republican members of Congress, who were desperately seeking issues to slow the momentum of the Johnson legislative avalanche, were delighted when local Democratic officials such as Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago attacked the CAAs. OEO cannot be dismissed as a disaster, however. Many of its programs were highly innovative and, though transferred from OEO to other agencies in subsequent years, continue to exist. OEO initiated a large legal aid program that represented poor people against landlords, local merchants, and unresponsive government agencies. * Neighborhood health centers markedly improved the health of many low-income persons, and nutritional and health programs for youth were established. * OEO administrators’ growing doubts about advocacy by CAAs led them to focus funding on such service programs as Head Start, a popular preschool program that combined recreational, educational, and health programs in summer as well as during the school year. The effectiveness of Head Start in raising the test scores of low-income children has been questioned, but some studies suggest that it has had long-term beneficial effects on the educational performance of its enrollees. * Discuss W elfare Reform in 1967 Relatively muted in the 1950s, resentment against AFDC recipients mounted during the 1960s when the program grew dramatically. One reason for this increase was that uprooted persons who fled rural areas and found bleak job prospects in urban areas were emboldened by civil rights protests to claim their right to AFDC. By the late 1960s, AFDC rolls were swelled further by women who realized that receipt of AFDC entitled them to receive Medicaid, food stamps, day care, and work-related incentive payments. * The mounting resentment against women on AFDC was fueled not only by the program’s growth but also by changing orientations toward work. Despite increases in the number of working women during the 1950s, many persons still believed that women should remain at home with their children. This sentiment decreased markedly during the 1960s, however, as more women of all social classes joined the labor force. With this change in attitude, conservatives began to demand that female welfare recipients obtain employment instead of welfare. In the face of conservative opposition to AFDC, the Johnson administration had a number of options. They could have capitulated to conservatives and accepted a variety of punitive strategies to force women off the AFDC rolls; they could have insisted that women on AFDC should not be compelled to work; or they could have devised programs to make it possible for women on AFDC to work. Most of the women wanted to work, but the last option would have required careful planning because adult AFDC recipients averaged only an eighth-grade education, often suffered discrimination in labor markets, required expensive day care programs, sometimes possessed physical or mental problems, and often could not find employment. But the Johnson administration never chose a consistent strategy. Some conservatives wanted to force women on AFDC to work. Northern liberals, LO 7-9 who had become supporters of welfare rights, opposed compulsory assignment to jobs for women with young children, insisted that jobs pay at least the minimum wage, and demanded that the level of AFDC grants be raised. * The administration did not believe it could oppose conservatives, as they had considerable strength in the Congress, and Johnson was unsympathetic to welfare recipients, whom he believed often sought benefits rather than employment. * The administration’s policy approach, which was reflected in the welfare amendments of 1967, was a confusing mixture of incompatible policies; ultimately, it satisfied no one. Some punitive policies were adopted; in particular, all women who did not have children younger than 6 years of age were required to work, at prevailing rather than minimum wages. A federal freeze on funds for AFDC was enacted but, for technical and political reasons, never implemented. Liberals were delighted to obtain a series of exemptions in the law that allowed welfare women to escape the work requirement if they were ill or if work was “inimical” to the welfare of the family. Liberals also obtained a work incentive provision that allowed women who obtained low-paying jobs to continue to augment their wages with welfare payments up to a certain cutoff point allowing many low-wage working women to earn more than they would have received as non- working welfare recipients. Although women who obtained relatively high- paying jobs lost their eligibility, this policy led, overall, to large increases in the welfare rolls. Some liberals also liked provisions that established the Work Incentive Program (WIN), which funded training programs and day care. Liberals were victorious, on balance, because exemptions meant that few women were forced to take jobs and the rolls increased rapidly in the wake of work incentive provisions. Their victory came at a high price, however. Their insistence that women should not be forced to work blinded them to the reality that most women on AFDC wanted to work, though for decent wages. Instead of scheming to outmaneuver conservatives and dilute the work requirement, they could have tried more diligently to develop millions of public service jobs or subsidized jobs in private industry, backed up by good day care programs and large job-training and educational programs. They would have encountered formidable opposition from conservatives because the costs of day care, training, and job creation would have far exceeded the cost of merely providing AFDC grants or the cost of the WIN programs, which provided superficial training and inadequate day care services. Discuss Food Stamps in 1964 The Food Stamp Program was enacted in 1964 in the wake of a series of pilot feeding programs during the Kennedy administration. Policy makers realized that distribution of surplus food to the poor was cumbersome and required recipients to travel to centralized storage sites. Instead, families were allowed to purchase food stamps—coupons—at a price considerably less than their retail value; a number of grocery stores across the country agreed to accept food stamps as payment. Families on welfare were automatically eligible, but many poor families not on welfare could also be certified by local welfare departments. Localities were given the option of participating in the program; the Department of Agriculture paid the entire cost. Successive amendments in 1968, 1971, 1973, and 1978 dramatically expanded funding for the program, established national eligibility standards, made the program mandatory in all states, and developed methods to allow recipients to receive coupons without having to make any cash payments. The Food Stamp Program was a landmark achievement because it gave millions of impoverished families the resources to purchase food in quantities not possible with meager welfare checks. LO 7-10 The Beleaguered President in a T rap of His Own Making: 1967–1968 All the decisions that Johnson had made in the preceding 3 years came into play as he entered 1966 and 1967. He refused to diminish his commitment to all-out war in Vietnam, despite discouraging reports from the battlefields that the enemy was not likely to yield and that mounting numbers of Americans would lose their lives or be maimed. He refused to diminish his commitment to domestic reforms and obtained the passage of dozens of new social programs, though they were often meagerly funded. He refused to push Congress to raise taxes, for fear of igniting pressure by conservatives to reduce social spending. Johnson’s extraordinary legislative successes on the domestic front were unprecedented in American history when measured by their sheer numbers. His successes in 1964 carried into 1965, when he obtained passage of 84 of the 87 measures that he submitted to Congress, and into 1966, when 97 of 113 measures were enacted. * As we discussed, Johnson’s successes were soon sabotaged by the three budget and policy choices he had made: tax cuts, military spending, and social reforms. Johnson committed himself to ambitious domestic reforms, then, in an environment of economic scarcity occasioned by military spending and tax cuts—and this budgetary scarcity was further increased by his decision to send large numbers of troops to Vietnam in 1965. Another politician might have decided to reconsider the tax policies, or the domestic policies, or the decision to send troops to Vietnam so as not to strain the budget excessively nor to anger Congress, which might wonder how he could engage in multiple endeavors that so stressed the federal budget. However, Johnson was committed to each of these policies. To extricate himself from this situation, Johnson engaged in activities that can only be called devious and manipulative. To minimize the strain on the federal budget and the size of the deficit, he sold huge amounts of American assets, including stockpiled metals such as aluminum and copper that the government had accumulated in case of war. * He made the true costs of Vietnam appear somewhat smaller by taking much of the personnel and equipment that had been devoted to defending Europe and transferring them to Vietnam. He constructed his military budget on the premise that the war would be over by June 1966—hardly a realistic scenario. By this means, he was able to give the impression that spending on Vietnam would be relatively small. * Although he enacted vast numbers of social programs, he often devoted little money to each one, so as to diminish their fiscal impact. For example, the much-publicized War on Poverty never received more than $2 billion in any given year. These various tactics, in turn, angered political groups on whom Johnson depended. Conservatives of both parties, already angered by the numbers of social reforms that Johnson proposed, accused him of hiding the true costs of the war—a charge readily supported by antiwar factions, who resented the diversion of funds from social reforms. Social reformers wondered nervously if Johnson’s Vietnam policy would curtail his domestic agenda; they also came to realize that, unlike previous wars, it was disproportionately fought by troops drawn from the African American and Latino communities. When viewed in fiscal terms, the Great Society could aptly be renamed the Frugal Society. Johnson increased spending on education, training, employment, and social (nonmedical) programs more than threefold during his administration but this increase was relatively modest considering that the federal government had hardly spent any resources on these programs when Johnson came into office. So Johnson created scores of new programs that were poorly funded, making them even more vulnerable to the charge that they were ineffective. Moreover, Johnson increased military and related spending almost three times as much as spending on education, training, employment, and social programs—or by $63 billion compared with $23.3 billion when measured in constant 1992 dollars. When we add entitlements like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to his expenditures on education, training, employment, and social programs, Johnson’s domestic programs accounted for only 28% of the federal budget, whereas military and related spending, as well as interest on the national debt, made up almost 70% of the federal budget. By early 1967, however, even the politically agile Johnson was running out of options. With changing circumstances, Johnson lost support across the political spectrum. Conservatives in Congress began to attack his credibility more assertively; they accused him of submitting deceptive budgets and suggested he should cut social spending. Equally troubling were public opinion polls suggesting that the widespread sympathy of middle- and working-class Americans for the plight of low-income Americans and African Americans that had existed in 1964 and 1965 had waned by 1968— resulting in white backlash. * Many of these white Americans believed Johnson had unfairly favored African Americans with an array of social programs that they believed disproportionately helped them. Moreover, many white working-class Americans were angered at the growth of liberal opposition to the Vietnam conflict—and often wanted Johnson to send even more troops to Vietnam. Some of them believed domestic reforms were absorbing resources that would have allowed Johnson to push even harder in Vietnam. Once African Americans had obtained civil rights legislation that decreased discrimination in the South, they sought reforms to address poverty, housing discrimination, education, and other problems in the North. Northern whites, who had often supported efforts to reduce discrimination in the South, were enraged when they became the targets of protest. Indeed, Martin Luther King, Jr., observed that he had never seen more hatred than he experienced in open housing marches in white Chicago suburbs in 1967. * The Northern whites who applauded when the Department of Justice attacked de jure segregation (which stems from policies creating segregated schools) in the South did not realize that the de facto segregation (which stems from geographic segregation of races) in their school districts would soon become the focus of reform. Many of them opposed policies to desegregate Northern schools by the use of busing, viewed affirmative action with skepticism, and believed that the Warren Court had been too kind to criminal offenders. Scandals in the War on Poverty, which were seized on by Republicans and conservatives, also soured public support for domestic reforms. Many whites responded negatively as well to the increasingly militant tactics of African Americans (and also of women, Latinos, and Native Americans). * King, who remained an influential leader until his assassination in 1968, found it increasingly difficult to persuade a new breed of African American leaders that nonviolence represented an inviolable principle rather than a tactic. Stokely Carmichael, who coined the term black power during a civil rights march in 1966, personified the trend among many African Americans toward separatism, the development of African American economic institutions, and (even) violent protest. * This militancy seemed to many white Americans to be reflected in the large number of urban riots and disturbances that occurred in Northern—and some Southern—cities between 1965 and 1968; 239 civil disturbances erupted, with 8,133 persons killed and 49,604 persons arrested. * Johnson’s popularity with liberals and social reformers also began to wane. Although many liberals had remained silent on Vietnam in 1966 and even early 1967, the silence was decisively broken in August 1967, when The New York Times called the war a “bottomless pit” and urged Johnson to curtail the American commitment to it—and when Martin Luther King spoke out against the war. * And then there was the unfolding debacle in Vietnam, where Johnson had engaged in a bombing campaign that was unprecedented in military history, against a small, largely agricultural nation, and had little to show for it except a weekly tally of returning body bags. Johnson had escalated the Vietnam conflict from a few military advisors and spies in 1964 to more than 540,000 troops in 1968. The resulting military defeat had a staggering cost in lives and resources. By the conclusion of American involvement in 1973, more than 55,000 Americans had been killed and 304,000 Americans had been injured. The U.S. Senate estimates that 1.4 million South Vietnamese were killed and wounded, another 850,000 enemy soldiers were killed, and 10.3 million refugees were created. Americans expended more than $135 billion on the war. * (See Insert 7.4 .) Insert 7.4. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: Balancing National Security and Domestic Needs Any nation legitimately wants to protect itself from foreign intruders and to involve itself in foreign policy issues that are germane to its interests. Yet nations also possess domestic problems that require the expenditure of resources, not to mention leadership from elected officials. Analyze the ethical merit of the decision during the 1950s to commit about 68% of the nation’s budget to military and military- related expenditures. Would it have been ethically principled, even when confronting a dictator like Stalin, to limit military spending to a smaller percentage of the nation’s budget? Would fewer missiles and fewer troops in Europe have sufficed to protect the nation’s security needs? Analyze how the Vietnam War affected the development of the Great Society. Was Martin Luther King correct when he opposed the war after several years of silence? How do you think the Iraq War during the administration of George W. Bush influenced domestic policy during his presidency? What similarities or differences do you see in its domestic impact compared with the Vietnam War? Would President Donald Trump’s decision to seek $70 billion in additional military spending create budget deficits that contributed to cuts in domestic spending by his fellow Republicans. Would these cuts in domestic spending, in turn, betray his commitments to help White blue-collar persons obtain jobs, medical care, and assistance with opioid poisoning? Should policy advocacy extend not only to domestic but to international issues? Johnson believed that a communist victory in South Vietnam would lead to others throughout Southeast Asia, and he assumed that the noncommunist regimes in South Vietnam possessed relatively broad support despite their corruption, intransigent resistance to land reform, and domination by conservative elites. Johnson reasoned that the U.S. Air Force, with napalm, helicopters, and B-52 bombers, could prevail over poorly supplied and sparsely clad Asians, that air strikes would demoralize the North Vietnamese, and that the enemy would accept his promises to provide them with billions of dollars on the cessation of hostilities. But Johnson underestimated the resolve of the North Vietnamese, who were deeply committed to a long-term conflict that they had already waged for decades. * The war had both indirect and direct effects on social policy. By focusing attention on foreign affairs, it created an atmosphere that was not conducive to the continuation of social reform. It alienated key supporters of social reforms who began to divert their energies from social advocacy to fighting the war, including many African Americans, liberals, young people, intellectuals, and clergy. * The increasingly militant demonstrations against the war antagonized some moderate whites who supported the war effort. The war also led to reductions in levels of funding for social programs. Most of all, the war eroded Johnson’s credibility. Many Americans remembered bitterly that Johnson had run against Goldwater in 1964 as a peace candidate. His deception in hiding the true costs of the war and his habit of overstating American military gains made many Americans distrust him. * Much as Franklin Roosevelt had squandered his landslide electoral victory of 1936 by attempting to pack the Supreme Court, Johnson lost his political momentum when he committed the nation to the war. * Some liberals were also infuriated in 1968 when Johnson orchestrated support for a tax increase to pay for the war by promising conservatives that he would call for substantial cuts in social spending. He had long promised that the nation could have both “guns and butter,” but he seemed now to acknowledge that Vietnam would lead to significant cuts in butter. By the spring of 1968, Johnson’s ratings in public opinion polls had sunk to such low levels that many pundits began to wonder if he could win reelection. His hand was forced by the New Hampshire primary, in which he was almost defeated by Eugene McCarthy, a relatively unknown senator running on an antiwar platform. Stung by this humiliation, Johnson withdrew from the presidential race, in the hope that he could orchestrate a peace settlement in Vietnam. In November, when Richard Nixon defeated Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic candidate, the Great Society came to an official close. But the Great Society, in fact, had ended in the rice paddies of Vietnam, long before the election results were tallied. Johnson left the presidency a tormented man. His international policies had led to uncertain outcomes and a loss of popularity. Yet Johnson, despite all of his failed decisions, had succeeded in enacting a remarkable array of domestic reforms that extended into many areas that had not been touched by the social reforms of the New Deal. Many of these policies still survive, such as civil rights, Medicare, Medicaid, Food Stamps, ESEA, and housing programs. Analyze the Oppression of V ulnerable Populations in the 1960s EP 2a Having already discussed policy reforms that affect African Americans throughout this chapter, we now turn to the oppression of other vulnerable populations. The civil rights struggles of African Americans motivated women, Latinos, gay men and lesbians, Asian Americans, and First Americans also to engage in policy advocacy. Each of these groups, in turn, developed reformist leaders and engaged in various forms of protest. Indeed, the momentum of their mobilizing carried protest well into the 1970s, before reform ebbed somewhat in the 1980s. LO 7-11 The Oppression of W omen Things were never the same once Rosie the Riveter entered the workforce. In World War II, millions of women went to work in production plants. They were supposed to return to their domestic roles when the war ended— and indeed 3.25 million women were forced, or persuaded, to leave industrial jobs after World War II. But the genie was out of the bottle. Women had tasted economic freedom, and a dramatic upturn in female employment occurred throughout the 1950s. By 1952, more women were employed than at the height of World War II, and the trend continued during the next four decades. * But women were not made to feel good about their work; indeed, the mass media and many theorists implied or stated that working women risked harming their children or destroying their femininity. * Following World War II, an effort to secure an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution assumed center stage among female activists. A host of distinguished women—Margaret Sanger, Pearl S. Buck, and Katharine Hepburn among them—supported the amendment and formed a coalition of organizations under the Women’s Joint Legislative Committee. Advocates hoped the ERA would sweep aside many state laws that still limited the rights of women to own and sell property, to make contracts, to control bequests, and to exercise parental authority. But other female leaders opposed the amendment on the grounds that women needed special protections, such as protective labor legislation, which might be erased by the amendment. Its fate was sealed, however, when it passed the Senate but failed to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. * Other women sought legislation to guarantee women equal pay for equal work in private employment; many legislators opposed it on the grounds that higher female wages might entice many women to abdicate their parenting role. But women who sought new challenges discovered innumerable barriers in the early 1960s. Relatively few women obtained access to work in the building trades or to training in male-dominated professions like law, medicine, and business; they were usually limited to gender-segregated jobs in clerical, sales, unskilled manufacturing, teaching, nursing, and social work. Women were widely perceived as fragile—they were not even allowed to run long distances in track meets—and so “protective laws” kept them from arduous work. Other cultural factors also hindered them. Women were required to be absent from the labor force for extended periods—often at least until their children had reached high school—and could not easily reenter it; if they did, they could not easily match the career gains of male workers who had been working continuously. Women had to contend, as well, with opposition from their husbands and lack of sympathy from their children, who often had expectations that women should do the bulk of household chores. Moreover, because the nation had virtually no governmentally subsidized child care in the early 1960s, working women had to pay for day care from their own—usually low—paychecks. As the 1960s began, some female activists hoped that President Kennedy would be sympathetic. At first, he was unresponsive. Under pressure, however, he appointed Esther Peterson as director of the Women’s Bureau in the Department of Labor. Peterson mobilized a campaign for enactment of equal pay legislation, which had foundered after World War II. Congress enacted an Equal Pay Act in 1963, but this legislation left out large groups of women, including domestics and farm workers, and did not speak to discrimination that blocked women from certain kinds of jobs and promotions. * (Because many women were confined to a gender-segregated workplace, the subject of equal pay was moot.) Moreover, Kennedy established a Commission on the Status of Women in 1961 to review existing policies regarding employment, social insurance, tax, labor, and social services. The commission made many constructive suggestions: it advocated a reduction in gender-based pay and promotion discrimination in the civil service and recommended more high-level presidential appointees. (Kennedy had already issued an executive order in 1961 requiring private employers with federal contracts not to discriminate on the basis of race or gender.) It also recommended broadening women’s access to education. However, the commission did not offer encouragement for women’s entry into male-dominated fields; it did not attack the fundamental gender role structure of American society or the prevailing notion that women should have primary responsibility for child rearing; and it did not seek basic changes in Social Security, which discriminated against single women who were not dependents or widows. * American women needed a theorist akin to Simone de Beauvoir, the French feminist who had so articulately analyzed the constraints placed on women in modern society. They found this theorist in Betty Friedan, whose classic book, The Feminine Mystique , was published in 1963. * Friedan dissected the malaise of the suburban woman who, “as she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies … was afraid to ask even of herself—‘Is this all?’” * Friedan contended that society had developed a mystique of feminine fulfillment, in which the American woman achieved a kind of happiness as housewife and mother that no women had ever obtained in prior eras. If she lacked this happiness, Friedan contended, she was taught to blame herself—that is, to look inward for neurotic tendencies, “penis envy,” or other personal failings. Isolated in her suburban “concentration camp,” the married woman had no chance to explore options or seek new challenges. * Friedan’s book ended with a ringing plea for “a new life plan for women”—a society in which, emancipated from past myths, women would “see through the delusions of the feminine mystique” to develop careers that would fully challenge them. * Lyndon Johnson made a promising start when he appointed many more females to high-policy posts than had Kennedy, but Johnson was indifferent to the inclusion of a ban on gender-based discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A number of legislators opposed this provision on the grounds that it could threaten protective labor legislation for women, such as laws regulating the hours and conditions of women’s work. Some powerful Southern legislators supported it for the wrong reasons, hoping that the addition of the controversial provision would kill the entire Civil Rights Act, which they opposed. Eleven of the 12 female legislators in the House of Representatives spoke eloquently for the measure, by insisting that women deserved the same protections as the racial groups who were included in Title VII. * When the ban and the legislation were passed by the Senate, women had finally been included in major civil rights legislation, almost a century after their exclusion in the wake of the Civil War—but their inclusion did not stem from any militant support by the administration. Nor did the Equal Opportunities Commission, established to investigate discrimination in employment by Title VII, focus on gender-based discrimination since it was preoccupied with racial discrimination. * Some advances were made through legal rulings, such as a 1965 ruling by the Supreme Court in Griswold v. Connecticut that declared a law that made the use of contraceptives a crime was unconstitutional.… However, the ruling left intact the ban on abortions in many states and did not speak to the absence of family-planning clinics in many jurisdictions. Other court rulings abolished certain residency requirements, midnight raids, and man- in-the-house rules that various states had devised to cut AFDC rolls. Although these early policy successes represented important gains, they were token measures or inadequately implemented. Recognizing that women needed to develop political clout, Betty Friedan and other women formed the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966 to seek federal action on women’s employment issues, such as tighter bans on sex discrimination by federal contractors, full deductibility of day care expenses, and more enforcement powers for the EEOC. NOW successfully pressured Johnson to include women within the scope of his September 1965 executive order that required affirmative action programs to ensure equal opportunity for all races—paving the way for affirmative action programs by local and state governments, federal contractors, and the federal government. This policy established the precedent that the term sex would appear whenever the phrase “race, creed, color, or national origin” appeared. * NOW also initiated another bid for an Equal Rights Amendment and secured widespread support for the measure from many candidates. A development that was as important as these political developments was that women had begun to form consciousness-raising groups, where issues like sexual abuse, harassment on the job, rape, women’s health, abortion, and job discrimination became topics of conversation rather than taboo subjects. These topics would become important policy issues over the next several decades, although the government response was uneven and often inadequate. Women had made important gains: they had received one-third of all the master’s degrees granted in the United States by 1968 and represented 58% of the labor force. The economic position of white women relative to white men had declined, however, in the two decades after World War II; fulltime female workers earned, on average, only 58.2% of the income of men in 1969, down from 63.3% in 1956. * The feminist movement often did not speak to the needs of African American or low-income women. African American women in the 1960s, who often had to work in order to survive, were less worried about the feminine mystique and more worried about the lack of economic opportunity and decent wages for themselves and for African American men. And some critics suggested that feminists risked making women who chose to emphasize child rearing over employment feel guilty. The Oppression of Gay Men and Lesbians The extent of prejudice against gay men and lesbians in the early 1950s is best revealed by a quote from Senator Kenneth Wherry (R, Neb.), who asserted that he wished to “harry every last pervert from the federal government services” on the grounds that “homosexuals in government are a moral and security issue … the lack of emotional stability which is found in most sex perverts, and the weakness of their moral fiber, makes them susceptible to the blandishments of foreign espionage agents.” * This virulent prejudice must be placed in the context of long-standing harassment, incarceration, and discrimination against gay men and lesbians. Underlying this systematic homophobia was a combination of religious ideas, which equated homosexuality with sin; psychiatric and medical thought, which saw it as mental or physical pathology; and criminology, which was inclined to perceive homosexual behavior as criminal. (Sodomy and other homosexual acts were widely punishable as crimes.) In this social climate, many gay men and lesbians came to think of themselves as diseased. World War II brought more attention to homosexuality, not only because the army made strenuous efforts to screen gay men and lesbians from service but also because so many escaped its net. For the first time, gay men and lesbians discovered that many others shared their sexual orientations—and same-gender associations were surprisingly common and open in barracks, dance halls, and combat zones. * Soldiers formed gay communities in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other major cities following the war, and institutions such as gay and lesbian bars became widespread. Sexual behavior became more openly discussed in the conservative 1950s, as reflected by the widely read Kinsey report, which addressed taboo topics like masturbation. * But gay men and lesbians in the 1950s led a life constricted by societal laws and prejudices. Witch hunts against communists in government often included gay men and lesbians. Eisenhower, in an executive order aimed at dismissing loyalty risks from government, explicitly listed “sexual perversion” and proceeded to remove presumed homosexuals from government at the rate of 40 per month in the first 16 months after the order; job seekers who were judged to be homosexual by the interviewer were denied employment. * Moreover, 2,000 persons per year were removed from the military in the early 1950s—a number that rose by another 50% by the early 1960s. State and local governments screened their 12.5 million employees with similar zeal and also cited homosexuality as grounds for dismissal. * Gay men and lesbians were also subject to arrests by local police and vice squads, who raided gay bars, restrooms, lesbian bars, and even personal residences. D’Emilio estimates that there were more than 1,000 arrests per year in the District of Columbia in the early 1950s. * Gay bashing by local gangs and petty criminals was also common. The gay and lesbian community began to develop organizations and leadership in the 1950s, but these organizations lacked a mass membership and had little success in changing social policies. A major problem among gay men and lesbians was that they were reluctant to publicly reveal their sexual orientation for fear of reprisal from law authorities or recrimination from landlords or employers. Moreover, many gay men and lesbians had internalized homophobia. * The emergence of a less oppressive social climate in the 1960s promoted the development of activism among gay men and lesbians. A succession of court rulings had gradually limited the ability of local and federal governments to censor or prohibit “obscene literature,” and so publications by gay and lesbian writers and groups could circulate more freely. As with so many other policies, the Warren Court led the way; finally, in 1967, it ruled that “a book cannot be proscribed unless it is found to be utterly without redeeming social value” even though the book is “patently offensive.” In the more permissive climate of the 1960s, mass-based magazines like Playboy were circulated—an unthinkable development in the 1950s. Howard Becker and other sociologists wrote on deviance from a relativistic perspective. Avoiding moral judgments about homosexual behavior, they urged an end to criminal penalties and exclusion from the armed forces. Lawyers began to develop suits against antisodomy statutes on the grounds that they violated personal liberty, and some local chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) became interested in pursuing discriminatory actions such as exclusion of gay men and lesbians from the civil service. Court decisions in a few states had legitimized the right of gay men and lesbians to assemble in local bars, and the possibility of further progress was suggested by movements in Europe that sought to decriminalize sex acts among consenting adults. * Some courageous clergy declared that the sexual orientations of gay men and lesbians were not immoral. And some city governments, such as the Civil Service Commission of New York City, began to relax the restrictions against the hiring of gay men and lesbians. Even mental health and health professionals began to reexamine traditional perspectives, and a committee established by the National Institute of Mental Health in 1967, though it refrained from declaring their orientation to be normal, urged tolerance of gay men and lesbians ( Figure 7.2 ). * Figure 7.2.

By the late 1960s, just as the black power philosophy emerged in the civil rights movement, the accommodationist and gradualist perspectives of other outgroups had begun to be supplanted by more radical perspectives. A pivotal development in New York City ignited the gay liberation movement in 1969. Some police officers and detectives raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. When the officers arrested the bartender, the Stonewall’s bouncer, and three drag queens, a riot broke out; it spread into the Village and continued through the next night. In the wake of the Stonewall riots, the gay and lesbian movements attracted a mass membership and developed a political agenda—to modify government policies at every level and to change the diagnostic categories of the American Psychiatric Association. Moreover, they made “coming out” a key organizing strategy; they hoped to persuade millions of gay men and lesbians to publicly announce their sexual orientations, despite possible reprisals. * Organizers’ spirits were buoyed by early successes, such as the decision of the American Psychiatric Association in 1973 that gay men and lesbians would no longer be regarded as mentally ill. But their work had barely begun. Generations of prejudice hung heavy over a nation that was only starting to rethink traditional stereotypes. The Oppression of Latinos At the beginning of the 1960s, Latinos, like African Americans, still lived in their traditional rural areas—for example, on the farms and ranches of the Southwest and the farms of the upper Midwest—but had also formed rapidly growing communities in some urban areas—in particular, in the Southwest and in Midwestern cities like Chicago and Kansas City. In the 1950s, moreover, there was a huge influx of Puerto Ricans to East Coast cities, particularly New York City, where between 850,000 and 1.2 million Puerto Ricans resided by 1970. * They often came to the United States for economic reasons because they had been displaced by the expansion of large American sugar and coffee corporations and because factories and service industries in New York wanted and solicited cheap labor. As with prior immigrant groups, many Puerto Ricans hoped to return to their homeland after they had improved their economic condition—but, in the end, most remained. Moreover, a substantial population of Cubans settled in the United States, particularly in South Florida, in the wake of the Cuban Revolution of 1959, which brought Fidel Castro to power. The so-called Chicano movement signaled the beginning of militant organizing projects that centered on Mexican Americans and undocumented workers. That movement was led by a series of charismatic leaders, including Reies Lopez Tijerina, who sought to restore lost Spanish and Mexican land grants in New Mexico, and Corky Gonzales, who organized grassroots groups in Denver. It was César Chávez, however, who captured national attention when he developed the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee to empower Mexican agricultural laborers. Recall that the Wagner Act of 1936, which established federal protection for persons who sought to organize unions, did not apply to farmworkers. As a result, organizers could be summarily fired or intimidated if employers thought they were making trouble. In 1966, after building a cadre of leaders, Chávez organized a march on Sacramento, the capital of California, to dramatize the plight of farmworkers. This march was followed by a flurry of organizing activities—most memorably, by well-publicized national boycotts of crops like grapes and lettuce to pressure agribusiness to recognize farmworkers’ right to organize. Simultaneously, Chávez pressured politicians in California to enact legislation that would provide agricultural laborers with the kinds of protections that the Wagner Act afforded other workers. The Latino community was active on many fronts: voter registration drives, pressure on the EEOC to assertively investigate job discrimination against Latinos, the development of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (a Latino counterpart to the NAACP), pressure that led to an extension of the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to Latinos, and the development of various coordinating councils to link the work of many advocacy groups. * Puerto Ricans, because of their strong personal ties to their homeland, had more difficulty in organizing protests against poor working conditions and wages, as well as atrocious living conditions; their patterns of migration back and forth to Puerto Rico undermined the cohesion of their communities in East Coast cities. * Moreover, unlike the farmworkers, who had a relatively identifiable enemy in agribusiness, and African Americans, who could attack Jim Crow laws, most Puerto Ricans were enmeshed in the constellation of factors that perpetuate urban poverty. The Oppression of Native Americans Native Americans had been placed on reservations during the 19th century following their eviction from their ancestral lands. These reservations were frequently assigned to one tribe; the government agreed to supply certain commodities or services (such as a school) in return for the tribe’s agreement to cede its ancestral lands. The early reservation experience was difficult for First Americans; because the reservations were too small to allow them to hunt and be self-sufficient, they had to rely on financial assistance from government agents and missionary groups. As we discussed in Chapter 4 , the federal government decided in 1887, soon after establishing the reservations, to break up tribes; the Dawes Act individualized Native Americans’ land holdings, made some of them American citizens, and provided them with a government school system, so as to socialize them to American ways. The chief instruments of this Americanizing strategy were the agents of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. * Congress conferred citizenship on all remaining First Americans in 1924. But the Americanization strategy did not work, because Native Americans held on to their indigenous culture. However, many Native Americans lost their land to speculators and crooks, or else chose to lease it to others to farm; still living on or near reservations, they became dependent on government rations. The Indian agent and his staff were empowered by the Snyder Act in 1921 to help Native Americans with a range of education, welfare, health, agricultural, and other functions and to provide technical assistance to First American policy makers and judges. By the 1920s and 1930s, government policy had again reversed itself, to emphasize preservation of reservations and culture. Indeed, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 promoted the establishment of tribal organizations, economies, and government, as well as the purchase of additional lands for the reservations. This desire to help Native Americans become self-sufficient stemmed partly from their economic desperation in the Great Depression. In the 1940s and 1950s, the pendulum swung again, as legislators and officials sought to diminish federal responsibilities by adopting an assimilationist strategy. Termination acts in the 1950s and early 1960s ended federal responsibility for various tribes, who had to turn to state governments for economic and other assistance. In the 1960s and 1970s, the pendulum swung back again. The War on Poverty placed considerable emphasis on supporting the culture of Native Americans, as well as their indigenous communities and tribal functions. Some of the reservations that had been terminated in the 1950s were restored to federal authority. Many Great Society programs channeled funds to the reservations for housing assistance, education, and economic development. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which had often sought to force mainstream American customs on Native Americans, became an advocate for Native Americans “in the same manner as the Department of Agriculture is pro-farmer and the Department of Labor, pro-labor.” * Both Presidents Johnson and Nixon strongly opposed the termination policy, sought to develop Native American participation in their governance, and favored continuation of federal technical and economic assistance to tribes. Indeed, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as well as other legislation in the 1970s, sought to give tribes the authority to decide whether to assume responsibility for administering federal programs of the Interior Department or the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Nor were Native Americans quiescent politically during the turbulence of the 1960s. Indigenous groups demanded compensation for lands that were taken from Native Americans illegally, sought protections for minerals and timber on reservations, and challenged stereotypical portrayals of Native Americans in films. Like African Americans and Latinos, they dramatized their demands by direct action—for example, the occupation of Alcatraz, an abandoned federal prison on an island in San Francisco Bay. As with other people of color, a significant number of Native Americans moved to urban areas, where they often resided in deteriorated communities and in poverty. Caught between two cultures, and not inclined to assimilate to the extent that many other groups did, Native Americans often had difficulty establishing their personal and collective identities. When the colonists arrived in the 17th century, there were roughly 10 million Native Americans, but by 1970 their numbers had dwindled to some 827,000, though many of them had been absorbed into the general population. *The Oppression of Asian Americans Asian Americans in Hawaii and California made important gains in achieving their civil rights in the wake of World War II and in the 1950s. Disenfranchised before World War II, Asian plantation laborers were registered in a massive drive by the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union during the war and secured an act by the Hawaii legislature that was akin to the Wagner Act. Sugar workers were able to unionize in a multiracial union that included Filipino, Japanese, and Portuguese laborers. California’s Japanese Americans were able to obtain from the Supreme Court a ruling that the California laws that prohibited a noncitizen alien from conveying his or her land to a citizen child were unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court ruled in 1948 that laws that prohibited people of different races from having sexual contact (antimiscegenation laws) were unconstitutional. In 1946, California voters decisively defeated an initiative that was placed on the ballot to reaffirm the alien land laws. In 1956, Japanese Americans placed on the ballot an initiative to overturn the alien land laws altogether and won. In 1952, the federal government finally terminated provisions of the 1790 naturalization law that refused citizenship to nonwhite individuals, partly because of lobbying by Japanese Americans. * But immigration limitations on Asians continued, despite token concessions to various nationalities following World War II. The blatantly racist immigration policies of the United States, which gave larger annual quotas to European nations than to Asian nations, were finally reversed in the Immigration Act of 1965. This act abolished the national-origin quotas and allowed annual admissions of 170,000 immigrants from the Eastern Hemisphere and 120,000 from the Western Hemisphere, not including immediate family members. As Takaki notes, “The new law represented a sharp ideological departure from the traditional view of America as a homogeneous white society.” * Indeed, a second wave of Asian immigrants during the next 30 years brought a massive increase in the Asian population; significant Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino populations were supplemented by Vietnamese, Korean, Asian Indian, Laotian, and Cambodian groups, as we will discuss in Chapters 9 and 10 . The Oppression of People of Color in the Urban Ghettoes By the end of the 1960s, people of color in the United States had predominantly been segregated within urban ghettoes, but this pattern was to become even more marked over the next two decades. As Latinos and African Americans entered American cities, they tended to reside in segregated communities—often communities that had been abandoned by other ethnic groups as they fled to suburban areas. New York City provides an example; in 1970, whites made up 63.3% of its population, whereas African Americans and Latinos, respectively, made up 19.2% and 15.2% of its population. By 1990, the white population had declined to 41.3%, whereas the African American and Latino populations had, respectively, risen to 27.7% and 23.7%. * (The statistics for other major American cities were similar.) Of course, Irish, Italian, Jewish, and other ethnic enclaves had traditionally existed in American cities, but their plight was enviable compared with that of people of color. Their upward mobility—that is, their ability to become wealthy so that they could eventually afford more expensive housing in better communities and the suburbs—was enhanced by the fact that they immigrated just as the United States was industrializing, so that they secured a position from the outset in the growing American economy— albeit a position that was poorly paid at first. By the time large numbers of Latinos and African Americans reached the cities in the 1950s, they found it difficult to penetrate an economic structure dominated by the whites who had preceded them. Moreover, white immigrants did not find themselves segregated by race in low-income communities that were encircled by vast middle-class suburbs, where most jobs were located. African Americans and Latinos were often denied mortgages by banks and often were not allowed to purchase houses in white areas due to restrictive covenants in the deeds of white owners. Denied education in rural areas before they left for the cities, African Americans and Latinos were probably less prepared to use education as the vehicle of upward mobility than were the Jews, Asian Americans, and white ethnic populations of prior eras. Moreover, inner-city schools often lacked staff who could relate to African American and Latino youth or lacked teaching skills—and segregated schools were often overcrowded, dilapidated, and lacked books and equipment prevalent in schools attended by white students. In addition to these problems, the segregation of these communities into urban ghettoes was coupled with selective outmigration of those individuals who were upwardly mobile. As a result, those who remained behind not only lived in poverty but also often lacked the role models, indigenous businesses, vibrant churches, and community cohesiveness that white ethnic groups had enjoyed. Discuss Social W ork in the 1960s Social work emerged from the Great Depression with a determination to upgrade the profession by making a bachelor’s degree mandatory for admission to graduate programs and by making all graduate programs last for 2 years. Casework remained the dominant methodology of the profession; macro practice occupied a decidedly secondary niche. Moreover, social workers in many states wanted to establish state-enforced standards and tests to register or certify social workers; that is, they wanted to establish lists of certified social workers who could then receive priority over nontrained workers in filling government and agency positions. The profession was trying, in effect, to distinguish its members from the legions of untrained staff who worked in government and nongovernment agencies. * Some people wondered if the profession risked being too elitist by requiring extended graduate training, but advocates of the master’s degree insisted that it was required to improve standards and to obtain competence in casework. The National Council on Social Work Education was established in 1946 to launch a study of social work education that would clarify relationships between undergraduate and graduate education; it was renamed the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) in 1952. The study concluded that graduate education was needed for professional practice and that undergraduate education provided only a pre-professional base. Though diminished in status, undergraduate education nevertheless continued; in 1951, 400 schools taught undergraduate courses in social work. * In 1955, seven separate social work associations were merged to form the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), with roughly 18,000 members; new members were required to have completed 2 years of graduate study. An important question remained: To what extent would this profession be committed to social action and social justice, in the tradition of Jane LO 7-12 Addams and the rank-and-file movement of the 1930s? Would casework, with its emphasis on individual counseling, draw into social work only those students with a narrow focus on individual remedies? And would it socialize students to view social action as extraneous to professional work? Developments in the 1950s did not augur well for those who wanted a social action perspective to be prominent in the profession. The macro side of the profession, such as community organization and administration, remained ill defined. Social policy offerings in schools of social work were uneven and often emphasized historical materials without also giving students the tools to engage in advocacy for the poor or other populations. A prominent set of educators infused casework with so much psychiatric content that it became irrelevant to those working-class and poor persons unable or unwilling to participate in extended intrapsychic explorations. Still, a movement to have a generalist curriculum began to give social work students breadth of content, rather than narrowly defined casework training. The profession was influenced by the turbulence of the 1960s. Even in the late 1950s, an exhaustive study of social work education recommended that community organization and administration join casework and group work as fully recognized interventions in social work, even if policy was still relegated to largely theoretical, philosophical, and historical roles. The advocacy of the War on Poverty infused life into community organizing and other macro aspects of social work; many scores of students joined these branches in the growing numbers of schools that offered relevant study. * The NASW engaged in extensive lobbying and advocacy in the 1960s, in contrast to its lower profile in the 1950s. * Social work, which remained the dominant profession in many nongovernmental social agencies, also retained its foothold in public agencies in the 1960s; its members were much involved in mental health, child welfare, and public welfare agencies. Thus enriching its mission and buoyed by the expansion of the welfare state, social work seemed positioned to provide much of the staff for a range of agencies and functions while retaining a reformist mission. But the profession was hardly free from controversy. Some people believed it to be too conservative. Protests by students in various schools of social work in the 1960s and by activists at national conferences called for social workers to be more assertive in challenging existing programs and policies. * A decision by the NASW in 1969 to give regular membership to holders of bachelor’s degrees from those undergraduate programs that met CSWE criteria was controversial within the profession; its advocates insisted that it would give NASW more political clout by vastly enlarging its membership, but its detractors insisted that it would lower standards and decrease the prestige—and thus the power—of the social work profession by diluting its membership. * Understand the Evolution of the Reluctant Welfare State Fortuitous circumstances and his formidable legislative skills enabled Johnson to enact a flood of social legislation that greatly expanded the American welfare state. He added an array of social-service, housing, job training, gerontology, medical, legal aide, and nutritional programs to the relatively few programs that had survived the New Deal. Roosevelt had established the foundations of the American welfare state; Johnson dramatically expanded its scope in a remarkably brief period. Considerable credit for the Great Society came from pressure from below, including the civil rights movement, the women’s movement, beginning mobilization of people with disabilities, Latinos, Native Americans, gays and lesbians, and other activist groups that kept pressure on legislators to maintain the pace of reform. The riots in the cities were a constant and grim reminder that America had a large population of citizens whose economic and social plight had not been frontally addressed by civil rights legislation. Critics contend that many of his programs were underfunded and poorly implemented because of the diversion of Johnson’s attentions and funds to Vietnam. * He had alienated many of his liberal supporters by 1968. He had helped to create, moreover, an increasingly powerful coalition of conservatives who opposed the Great Society. Such conservatives as George Wallace and Barry Goldwater had led to an upsurge in conservatism —and they hoped to elect a Republican dedicated to conservative principles in 1968. The size and nature of the American welfare state would prove highly controversial in the coming decades, with liberals and conservatives often at odds. LO 7-13 Link the Great Society to Contemporary Society What W e Can Learn from Policy Advocates of the Great Society EP 3a We have discussed the extraordinary policy advocacy of Martin Luther King as he persisted for almost two decades in enduring unimaginable hostility and danger from many white Americans. We can also get lessons on policy advocacy from César Estrada Chávez, who used policy advocacy tactics similar to those of Martin Luther King, but with a Latino population of Mexican heritage mostly located in California and in the Southwest in the 1960s (see Insert 7.5 )—as well as social worker Whitney Young, who changed the Urban League into an instrument of social justice. Insert 7.5. Proﬁles in Leadership: César Estrada Chávez (1927–1993) César Estrada Chávez—farm labor-rights activist and leader of the United Farm Workers Union—is best remembered for his leadership role in the grape boycotts of California and his nonviolent approach to social and labor reform. Chávez was born in 1927, in the North Gila LO 7-14 Valley of Arizona, 20 miles outside of Yuma. In the years following the Great Depression, his parents sold their farm to pay taxes. The Chávez family subsequently migrated to the Central Valley of California in search of agricultural work. As the family followed the harvest from one town to the next, keeping young Chávez and his four siblings in school became more and more challenging. And aside from the difficulty of keeping the children enrolled in school, there was a practical rationale for keeping extra hands in the fields. By the time Chávez reached the seventh grade, he had been enrolled in at least 30 different schools. In 1946, after serving in the U.S. Navy for 2 years, Chávez returned to the life of a migrant farm laborer. Two years later, he married Helen Fabela, and, in 1950, they moved to San Jose, California. There he had his first experience in the politics of farm labor reform and labor union organizing. In 1962, Chávez and his family moved to Delano, California, where he began organizing workers; since then, California’s agriculture industry has not been the same. Like many reformers who came before him, César Chávez faced intense, at times violent, opposition from those who favored maintaining the status quo—a situation in which a substantially large group of farm laborers was denied its civil rights and access to social justice. The opposition included many powerful and politically well- connected farmers and political leaders who believed that Chávez was promoting a communist revolution within the United States. Ironically, even a few of the communities to which Chávez was trying to bring relief opposed his reform efforts. Several groups began forming countermovements, such as Mothers Against Chávez , which was established in the hub of the famous grape strikes of 1965—Delano, California. Another countermovement, the Agricultural Workers Freedom-to-W ork Association , made up mostly of Mexican Americans, was created with the help of several grape growers to thwart the grape strike, the boycott, the United Farm Workers, and Chávez. But after many years of hard work and personal sacrifice, Chávez, together with many who supported his reform movement, succeeded in bringing much-needed reform to perhaps the most backward, repressive, and certainly one of this country’s last strongholds of cheap labor—the agriculture industry. Part of Chávez’s success can be directly attributed to the strength of his character and his deep moral convictions, which were based on selflessness, patience, concern for his community, discipline, and commitment to nonviolent activism. Undoubtedly, these personal attributes sustained Chávez on his treks across California’s San Joaquin Valley and provided strength and courage during his extensive fasts (hunger strikes). The other part has to do with the fact that Chávez quickly learned that the most useful tool in effecting positive change was his willingness and ability to build and maintain coalitions and alliances with individuals and groups outside his own movement. The strength of the agriculture reform movement was also augmented by Chávez’s ability to reach out to prominent politicians and Hollywood celebrities who supported the promotion of civil rights in farm labor. Because of the publicity that followed these figures, national and international scrutiny was drawn to the working conditions faced by migrant laborers. With the nation’s attention focused on the abuses suffered by farm laborers, Chávez appealed to the American conscience by presenting the boycott of grapes as a moral issue. The combination of his personal character and his strategic approach to social reform allowed Chávez and his followers to withstand the many assaults that were launched against their movement to bring social justice to farm laborers. Thus, Chávez earned the right to be recognized as the individual responsible for bringing the benefits of organized labor to the last large segment of unorganized American workers and for providing the farm laborer a sense of dignity and pride. Both Martin Luther King and César Chávez were strong adherents of nonviolence in the movements that they created. Partly this was an ethical choice stemming from both men’s abhorrence of violence. Partly, however, it was based on tactical considerations. Had Latinos or African Americans resorted to the deliberate use of violence—as did such dissident groups in the 1960s as the Symbionese Liberation Army or (to a far lesser degree) the Black Panthers—they not only would have been ruthlessly suppressed, but would have alienated large portions of the white population whose support they desperately needed to obtain policy reforms in state and federal legislatures. Both King and Chávez realized that African American and Latino populations were minority groups that lacked the political clout to obtain major policy reforms without considerable assistance from the general public and from key public officials. This dependence on others for support was magnified by the gross underrepresentation of both groups in public offices. Both men realized that they could exponentially increase their power compared to their adversaries in the South and in rural parts of California if they could take higher (moral) ground. If their adversaries often resorted to violence and flagrant violation of human rights, they would use nonviolent strategies. If their adversaries were portrayed in the mass media and television as attacking African Americans and Latinos, they were portrayed as demonstrating remarkable courage as they peaceably stood their ground even as dogs, fire hoses, and epithets were used against them. Both men used the mass media to build support in the broader population by informing and inviting the media to their nonviolent demonstrations. Both men skillfully enlisted persons from the white community as volunteers or helpers in their movements, whether white students and liberals from the North who engaged in voter registration and freedom rides in the South or white Americans who boycotted grapes and lettuce to put pressure on the corporate growers who refused to let farm workers develop a union. Heroic as King and Chávez were, they point to tactical challenges confronting all policy advocates who seek social reforms for vulnerable populations. Many legislators are indifferent to the needs of vulnerable populations, whether because they identify with relatively affluent citizens or do not have sufficient numbers of members of specific vulnerable groups in their constituencies. Policy advocates need, then, to surmount this political opposition or indifference by framing their issues in moral or economic terms that appeal to a broader audience. Martin Luther King portrayed the needs of African Americans in moral terms, often invoking religious and moral principles—and appealing to the higher nature of persons. César Chávez appealed not just to ethics, but to economics when often noting that Americans would literally not receive food commodities unless farm workers were treated fairly and allowed to organize unions. We, too, must struggle with ways to frame issues so that we appeal to an audience broader than the relatively small group of persons who naturally resonate to the needs of underdogs. The policy advocacy of Whitney Young demonstrates how social workers can assume influential roles in developing national policy. Not only was Whitney Young a dean of a school of social work, but he became an important advisor to President Lyndon Johnson (see Insert 7.6 ). Insert 7.6. Proﬁles in Leadership: Whitney Moore Young, Jr. (1921–1971) Whitney Moore Young, Jr.—social worker and race relations expert— is best remembered for the role he played in drawing the once conservative National Urban League into the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Young, who was born in Lincoln Ridge, Kentucky, on July 31, 1921, was the second of three children born to Laura (Ray) Young and Whitney M. Young, Sr. His father was an African American leader in Kentucky and president of the Lincoln Institute. His mother was an educator and postmistress of Lincoln Ridge. After finishing high school Young attended Kentucky State College for Negroes and the University of Minnesota, earning his B.S. and M.S.W. degrees, respectively, in 1941 and 1947. Young chose social work instead of medicine as a career following a poignant racial experience in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was placed in a segregated antiaircraft unit with white officers—and forced to mediate between them and African American privates when he was promoted to sergeant after just three weeks. While at the University of Minnesota, Young became involved with the Minneapolis Urban League, where he did fieldwork. In 1947, he was appointed industrial relations secretary of the St. Paul Urban League and was successful at integrating the workforces of several firms in the area. In 1950, due to his success in St. Paul, Young was appointed the Omaha Urban League’s executive director. His efforts in Omaha led to the hiring of several African American cab drivers, stenographers, telephone operators, and architects. In each case, it was the first time an African American had been hired to fill these positions. Meanwhile, Young also tried to open up the housing market to racial integration. As an instructor at Creighton University, Young developed administrative skills, which he used once he arrived at Atlanta University. From 1954 to 1960, Young served as dean of the School of Social Work of Atlanta University. There, he worked to integrate the faculty and student body and introduce changes in the curriculum. Together with other African American professionals, Young organized the Atlanta Committee for Cooperative Action, which reported on the racial conditions in the city. Young received a fellowship from the General Education Board to Harvard University and was appointed executive director of the National Urban League. Throughout the 1960s, under the leadership of Whitney Young, the National Urban League instituted numerous programs aimed at providing solutions to the critical social and economic problems faced by African Americans. The League’s efforts included programs to assist African American veterans of the Vietnam War, to promote the development of African American leadership within local communities, and to improve the living conditions of residents of the inner city. In 1963, Young championed a Domestic Marshall Plan, which recommended spending $145 million over a 10-year period to eliminate this nation’s racial ghettoes. The reform efforts of Whitney Young and the National Urban League attracted the attention and financial support of major corporations and important agencies, including the Ford, Rockefeller, Taconic, Alfred P. Sloan, and Field foundations. By the middle of the 1960s, it was clear Young had succeeded in drawing the once conservative National Urban League into the civil rights movement. The League became involved in voter registration drives within the African American community and helped plan—and was present during—the March on Washington, DC, in 1963. Financially backed by the Taconic Foundation, Young organized the Council for United Civil Rights Leadership, which provided funds to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, to the Congress of Racial Equality, to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Recognizing his outstanding leadership abilities, several U.S. presidents, including John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon, called on Young to advise them on civil rights matters. President Johnson, with whom he maintained a close relationship, allowed Young to contribute his ideas to the War on Poverty and made him an observer during the Vietnam War to examine the conditions faced by African American soldiers. Young was also instrumental in strengthening several civil rights laws during the Johnson years. His genuine commitment to the African American community and his work in expanding civil rights resulted in a $28 million federal grant to the National Urban League during the Nixon administration. Whitney Moore Young, Jr., suffered a tragic and untimely death on March 11, 1971, in Lagos, Nigeria. Moving from the School of Social Work at Atlanta University, Young became the leader of the National Urban League. His policy advocacy involved, moreover, organizational change as he converted the National Urban League from a staid, relatively conservative organization into a full- fledged participant in the civil rights movement—and a developer of major policy proposals such as the concept of a Domestic Marshall Plan. Realizing that organizational change is an integral part of policy advocacy, Young focused on changing the policies and procedures of the National Urban League rather than focusing only on changes in public policy. If organizations do not speak to social justice issues or address deep-seated needs of their communities, they do not fulfill the mandate provided by the Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers, which requires professionals to advance the ethical principle of social justice. Policy advocates seeking organizational change—whether they are line staff, supervisors, executives, or members of a board of directors—engage in the same eight tasks depicted in the policy advocacy framework, as shown in in Figure 2.1 . They use ethical reasoning to detect flaws in existing services, use navigational skills to decide what aspects of agency services need to be changed, place issues or ideas on the agendas of key decision makers, analyze specific issues or social problems, develop proposals, seek their enactment, troubleshoot their implementation, and assess their effectiveness. As also illustrated by Jane Addams more than 50 years earlier, Young demonstrated that social workers can be effective advocates for social justice no matter where they are employed or the focus of their work. They can join coalitions, lobby policy makers, assist candidates who favor social justice, run for office, take positions in government or reform-minded nongovernmental organizations, bring public attention to unmet needs, and empower clients. What W e Can Learn from the Persistence of Unmet Needs and Policy Issues during the Great Society When Martin Luther King relocated his movement to Chicago in 1966 to focus upon poverty in Northern cities, he encountered extreme poverty. Inner-city African Americans often lived in squalid housing and unsafe neighborhoods. They attended understaffed and ill-equipped inner-city schools. They lived in extreme segregation. They had scant access to union jobs and were denied many other jobs due to racial discrimination in hiring practices. They were marginalized in the political process. They were not given job training. Substantial numbers of African American male youth were incarcerated for minor offenses—and then not given education, services, and job training to allow them to reenter society. Considerable progress was made in the 1960s and 1970s in reducing the amount of poverty in the United States. Yet the number of persons living below official poverty lines increased in subsequent decades and included not only persons of color but single (mostly female) heads of households, youth, homeless persons, young graduates of foster care, white males with no more than high school education, elderly persons with chronic health conditions, and many immigrants. It seemed that the nation was beginning a national dialogue about poverty in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005 because of the televised images of stranded and impoverished African Americans on freeways, in the New Orleans Superdome, and on the roofs of homes. But New Orleans was soon placed on the back pages of the media. If we fast-forward to the presidential campaigns of Democratic and Republican candidates in 2007 and 2008, only one of them (John Edwards) devoted significant time to the issue of poverty. As social workers, we need to work to keep this issue alive in an affluent nation that ought not tolerate poverty—and propose policies that might reduce poverty. If we move forward again to the presidential campaigns of 2016, neither Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump mentioned the word, “poverty,” in their speeches. What W e Can Learn from Failed Policy Strategies of the Great Society The Vietnam War demonstrates that policy advocates don’t have the luxury of focusing exclusively on domestic issues. Had the nation not plunged into this war, far greater resources would have been available for domestic policies. The attention of the president and Congress would not have been diverted as much from important social policy issues. Moreover, hundreds of thousands of innocent Vietnamese civilians would not have been injured or killed. The Iraq War had eerie similarities to the Vietnam War. It diverted trillions of dollars from other worthwhile policies by the time the injured veterans have received medical care over a period of decades. It, too, diverted presidential and congressional time to prosecuting—and seeking an end to the war. It resulted in injuries and death to countless innocent Iraqi citizens. Rather than curtailing terrorism, it is likely that the American invasion and occupation of Iraq stimulated terrorism by giving Al-Qaeda a recruiting tool for Arab youth across the Middle East to “drive out the American imperialists.” It was a prelude to years of unrest in the Middle East and the commitment of tens of thousands of American troops to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to (at least) 2018. The Great Society illustrates, too, that huge tax cuts can often constrict resources needed for domestic reforms. Had Johnson not enacted his tax cut, he might even have considered such sweeping reforms as national health insurance once the Democrats obtained huge congressional majorities in the election of 1964. Or he might have fully funded Food Stamps rather than merely beginning a pilot program. Or he might have fully funded his War on Poverty, including vastly larger training and job programs for low-income minority youth. What W e Can Learn from Promising Strategies of the Great Society The Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965 represented a giant leap forward for the United States after more than 350 years of trampling on the rights of African Americans. Not only were these acts highly successful policies with respect to African Americans, but they also spawned scores of additional civil rights measures for many of the 16 vulnerable populations we have discussed in this book. Civil rights legislation is part of the regulatory portion of the American welfare state because it establishes rules that guide conduct and that have the force of law. When working with clients in contemporary society, social workers need to understand what civil rights laws exist so that they can refer clients to enforcement authorities that monitor and police adherence to these laws. What We Can Learn from the Great Society about the Structure of the American W elfare State During the Great Society three major additions were made to the American welfare state that are still integral parts of it. First, we have just discussed civil rights legislation that contained key provisions with respect to persons of color and women—legislation that would be augmented in coming decades with civil rights legislation for women, disabled persons, GLBT persons, and other vulnerable populations. Some of this legislation would be enacted at the federal level of government, while other civil rights legislation would be enacted by specific states. Second, myriad federal programs were enacted that were funded by the so- called discretionary budget and that were also called categorical programs . The federal budget consists of two major portions. One of them funds so- called entitlements (such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) which are automatically funded to the level of claimed benefits in any specific year. In other words, all persons who seek retirement pensions from Social Security or health benefits from Medicare or Medicaid receive them in a specific year because no annual funding ceiling is placed upon them. By contrast, programs funded by the discretionary portion of the federal budget are funded to levels each year that Congress establishes for each nonentitlement program. Take the example of the Head Start program that was established in the Great Society. Congress decides to fund it at a specific level for a specific year, such as $300 million. Once Head Start’s expenditures exceed this amount in that year, it cannot serve additional children—and may even have to cut the funding of some programs. Moreover, Congress can decide to fund these discretionary levels at lower levels than their authorizations. President Johnson secured the enactment of more than 150 programs funded by the discretionary budget. They were also called “categorical programs” because the legislation specified how the money was to be used —thus not allowing the states or local governments to use the funds for other purposes. In the case of Head Start, for example, the legislation specified in some detail that children had to be of preschool age and listed the kinds of services the children would receive. Third, President Johnson enacted two new “entitlements,” namely, Medicare and Medicaid (Food Stamps later became an entitlement), to add to the entitlements enacted by President Franklin Roosevelt (Social Security pensions, unemployment insurance, ADC, AB, and OAA). Since they are automatically funded to the level of claimed benefits each year, entitlements have a privileged position in the federal budget process: they cannot be cut in annual budget fights as easily as programs funded by the discretionary budget. To summarize, then, the Great Society established the modern American welfare state by greatly expanding it in three directions. We shall note in subsequent chapters how most of these programs remain in place, but many were changed to give states far more power in shaping their direction—and in 1996 AFDC was converted from an entitlement to a discretionary program called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).

Yet social spending rose dramatically during this ostensibly conservative period. Indeed, few people realize that the first term of Nixon’s presidency (1969–1972) ranks as a major period of social reform and was supplemented by some reforms in his 1974 Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act enacted ; Title XX (social services ) added to Social Security Act 1974 Nixon resigns presidency under threat of impeachment due to the Watergate scandal and is succeeded by Gerald Ford 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act passed ; Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) enacted for poor wage earners 1976 Jimmy Carter elected president 1977 Carter introduces welfare reform plan , which is later defeated 1978 Report of President’ s Commission on Mental Health issued 1979 Carter introduces unsuccessful national health insurance plan ; Ofﬁce of Education becomes the Department of Education when it is separated from the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare (HEW), which becomes the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 1980 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act enacted ; Mental Health Systems Act passed remaining years in the presidency. Sar Levitan, a noted policy commentator, argues that “the greatest extensions of the modern welfare system were enacted under the conservative presidency of Richard Nixon with bipartisan congressional support, dwarfing in size and scope the initiatives of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.” * Although Levitan seems to forget that many of Nixon’s reforms consisted of simply expanding programs he inherited from the Great Society, such as the Food Stamp Program, he correctly notes that many social reforms and considerable increases in social spending occurred during the Nixon years; Tom Wicker, a biographer of Nixon, concurs. * Nevertheless, Nixon was extremely conservative in much of his rhetoric and turned sharply to the right in 1972. With its conflicting tendencies, this was a transitional era between the reformist period of the Great Society and the conservative presidency of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. At the end of this chapter, we discuss what we can learn from the Paradoxical Era about policy advocacy, social policy, and the structure of the American welfare state in contemporary society. Analyze Richard Nixon, Political Opportunist EP 9b Richard Nixon achieved early successes in House and Senate races in the late 1940s and early 1950s by alleging that his opponents had left-wing tendencies and by spearheading congressional investigations of Alger Hiss, a State Department official who was accused and ultimately convicted of spying for Russia. These tactics earned him the disdain of liberals, but they brought sufficient public support that Dwight Eisenhower chose Nixon as his running mate in his presidential campaigns of 1952 and 1956. Nixon obtained the Republican nomination for the presidency in 1960 but narrowly lost to John Kennedy. After losing a bid for a California Senate seat in 1962, Nixon retired from politics, only to resurface as the Republican presidential candidate in 1968 against Hubert Humphrey, whom he subsequently defeated by a thin margin. Liberal critics of Nixon had long accused him of willingness to use red- baiting and other dubious tactics to secure power, but his opportunism also led him to support liberal domestic policies when he believed they would enhance his political career. These calculations sometimes led him to support moderate positions during the 1950s, when Republicans understood that frontal attacks on New Deal programs, such as Social Security, were unpopular. * Nixon correctly perceived that a power vacuum existed in the Republican Party in the wake of the Democratic landslide victory over Goldwater in 1964. By assuming the role of mediator and statesman within the leaderless LO 8-1 and demoralized party and by aggressively campaigning for Republicans of all persuasions in succeeding years, he successfully positioned himself for the presidential bid in 1968. * Nixon obtained the nomination for the presidency in 1968 because he convinced each segment of the Republican Party, including liberal, moderate, and conservative wings, that he represented them. * His election campaign in 1968 did not suggest that he would soon initiate or support a series of domestic reforms. Sensing that the Democratic contender, Hubert Humphrey, was vulnerable among working- and middle- class voters because he was identified with the Vietnam conflict and with black power and other reform groups, Nixon avoided major social issues, promised peace with honor, and pledged he would be tough on the issue of crime. He appealed to Southerners by promising to terminate federal efforts to desegregate schools and by giving Senator Strom Thurmond, a conservative Southerner, a prominent role in selecting the law-and-order theme of his campaign. He chose Spiro Agnew as his vice president in an obvious effort to appeal to white backlash sentiment and repeatedly attacked alleged social reform excesses of the Great Society. * Nixon’s conservative rhetoric in the campaign of 1968 was not a good predictor of his subsequent policy choices, particularly in the first 3 years of his presidency. His motivation for supporting various social reforms defies easy analysis because he was an enigmatic man, to whom Churchill’s characterization of Russia (“a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma”) might aptly apply. Wicker contends that Nixon was not devoid of sympathy for the poor because of his own experience of poverty during his childhood; however, Wicker also notes that Nixon’s choices were dictated by political concerns, such as his desire to broaden the base of the Republican Party. * Indeed, other writers place considerable stock in the Disraeli thesis—that is, that Nixon’s reading of English history inspired him to be an American conservative who, much like Disraeli, the English conservative prime minister of the 19th century, would support certain reforms to pull new working-class constituents into his political party. * Likewise, many theorists believe that he was persuaded by the arguments of Kevin Phillips, who maintained that the Republican Party could construct a new majority by attracting large numbers of working-class voters, Catholics, members of white ethnic groups, and residents of the Sunbelt. * Yet other commentators suggest that much of his behavior derived from a perverse pleasure in upstaging or surprising the Democrats. * Another intriguing theory is that Nixon supported social reform mainly to retain the support of liberals in both political parties for his foreign policies, including his Vietnam policy. * If this was indeed the case, it represented an interesting reversal from Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, both of whom had to cut social spending to placate conservative congressional foes. Nixon also knew that Democrats, who controlled both houses of Congress, would push him to support many liberal measures. Doubtless, Nixon was often driven by some combination of these motivations, but the bottom line was that he supported or agreed to an array of social reforms. Nevertheless, Nixon’s reform strategy rested on profound ambivalence, both ideological and political. Nixon was not instinctively a liberal, even if he was willing to espouse liberal causes for political reasons. He despised many liberal Republican senators, such as Charles Percy of Illinois. Many of his advisors, as well as broad sections of his party, were conservative and unlikely to support liberal policies. An inner circle of ambivalence thus existed in the White House in Nixon’s first term and led to contradictory policies. By 1972, this ambivalence turned to outright opposition to many social policies and to a determination to cut social spending, even by impounding funds that Congress had already appropriated for specific programs. * Nixon’s Strategy: Floating Coalitions and Outbidding Nixon both initiated social legislation and responded positively to congressional initiatives. When Nixon supported social reforms, he used a floating coalition and political outbidding. The floating coalition strategy depended on fashioning a coalition that included the support of some liberal Republicans, some moderate Republicans who were loyal to the president, and some Democratic liberals and moderates who placed their ideology before their party—that is, a bipartisan coalition of moderates and liberals to oppose conservatives, with the precise composition of the coalition varying from issue to issue. * In the political outbidding strategy , he endorsed social reforms that were initiated by Democrats but offered expansive amendments to them—or accepted them with little change—so that he could obtain partial credit for their passage. * It was a strange spectacle to many political observers; no Republican president since Theodore Roosevelt had sought to enact so many domestic reforms, much less to try to beat the Democrats at their own game. Floating coalitions and outbidding represented bold strategies that could be successful only in a particular political environment. To employ this strategy, Nixon first had to want to expand the political base of the Republican Party and had to believe, as well, that blue-collar and white ethnic voters desired social reforms. Second, he had to believe that he could persuade members of his own party that the social reforms he developed were different from the Democratic reforms that they had opposed since the New Deal. Where Lyndon Johnson had sought programs that emphasized social and medical services, community participation of the poor, and expanded roles for the federal government, Nixon sought reforms that provided jobs and income, expanded the policy roles of local governments, and used private market mechanisms rather than direct government provision. * He believed that, by portraying his programs as “hard benefits” that were superior to the social services offered by Democrats, he could gain the support of many Republicans and also of blue-collar voters, local officials, and the business community (see Insert 8.2 ).

Critical Analysis: Services versus Hard Beneﬁts Nixon framed social policy as a choice between social services and hard benefits. Was he correct? 1. Analyze the functions of both service and benefit programs in the welfare state. 2. What would society look like if either kind of program were largely eliminated? 3. Choosing any major social problem, discuss how those upon whom it has the greatest impact often need both social services and hard benefits. To underscore the distinctiveness of Republican reforms, Nixon unleashed scathing attacks on the innovations of the Great Society, which he depicted as undisciplined and ineffective programs that enriched bureaucrats and social workers. * Third, Nixon had to believe that increased domestic spending would not jeopardize the nation’s economic growth by causing deficits or by drawing capital from investments. He believed that, following the Vietnam conflict, there would be economic surpluses sufficient to fund new programs, and he favored the use of increased social spending to bring about economic recovery during and after a sharp recession in 1970. * Finally, he needed to have a significant number of liberal advisors to provide him with reform ideas and to fend off conservative advisors who were beholden to the conservative wing of the Republican Party; nevertheless, in keeping with his policy ambivalence in his first term, he also appointed many conservative advisors. * He named the relatively liberal Robert Finch as his secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and, when Finch suffered a nervous breakdown, replaced him with Elliot Richardson. He appointed Daniel Moynihan, a moderate Democrat who was critical of the Great Society but favored income, job, and other reforms, as the director of his Urban Affairs Council. From Strategy to Policy Reforms enacted during Nixon’s first term (1969–1972) included the Supplementary Security Income (SSI) program; major revisions in the Food Stamp Program; indexing of the Social Security program; revenue sharing; the consolidation of social services in Title XX to the Social Security Act; addition of a family planning program to the Public Health Act; assorted health legislation; development of affirmative action policies; establishment of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); and policies that led to the desegregation of virtually all Southern schools. These policy enactments, which would have represented a remarkable achievement even for a Democratic president, were supplemented by two major proposals that were not enacted: a proposal to reform welfare programs (the Family Assistance Program, or FAP) and a proposal for national health insurance. In Nixon’s second term (1973–1974), the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), the Community Development Block Grant Program, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Child Abuse Prevention Act of 1973 were enacted. Understand W elfare Policy Virtually no one was satisfied with the AFDC program. Liberals believed it limited assistance to families with single parents in many states and disliked its low eligibility levels and often paltry grants; conservatives believed it encouraged substantial numbers of women not to work and included too many working mothers who had retained their eligibility owing to the work incentive provisions of 1967. * Faced with this crossfire from liberals and conservatives, Nixon had several options. He could have sought incremental and liberalizing reforms to increase the levels of benefits in low-benefit states, as suggested by a task force headed by Richard Nathan, or he could have favored incremental and conservative reforms, such as those suggested by economist Arthur Burns, to strengthen the work requirement and to create public service jobs. At the urging of Daniel Moynihan, however, Nixon decided to seek a comprehensive reform of the nation’s welfare system, partly because his advisors feared that the Democrats would preempt the issue by announcing their own reform measure from a commission that had been appointed by Johnson. * Moynihan convinced Nixon that his plan offered a lasting policy solution to a vexing problem because it focused on provision of income, work incentives, and public service jobs. At a critical juncture, Moynihan told Nixon that the new program would permit the termination of scores of social workers, whom Nixon detested and associated with Democratic reforms, and would extend benefits to many blue-collar and white ethnic voters, as intact families and working (but poor) persons were both eligible. * Democrats and Republicans alike were astonished when President Nixon announced in August 1969 that he wanted to revamp the nation’s welfare programs by establishing a Family Assistance Plan (FAP) to replace the AFDC and AFDC-U programs that would provide federal assistance to all LO 8-2 families who fell beneath a federally prescribed minimum income. (Enacted in 1961, AFDC-U had given states the option to offer AFDC assistance to families with unemployed fathers, but fewer than half of the states had exercised this option.) FAP provided for all intact families a nationwide guaranteed income that was higher than prevailing welfare standards in many Southern states. It had even more generous work incentives than the 1967 provisions, proposed the creation of large numbers of public service jobs for welfare recipients, and contained a large day care program. In one policy stroke, then, FAP proposed to repeal the AFDC program and replace it with a national program. It did not constitute truly massive redistribution of resources to the poor, however. It would have provided only $4.5 billion in additional federal outlays. * FAP soon became enmeshed in the same crossfire between liberals and conservatives that had plagued the AFDC program. Fearing its defeat by a combination of Republican and Democratic conservatives, Nixon stressed that FAP contained a strong work incentive and work requirement. The legislation breezed through the House because of the diligent help of Wilbur Mills, chair of the Ways and Means Committee; but it encountered opposition from conservative Republicans and Democrats in the Senate Finance Committee, who succeeded in demonstrating that thousands of FAP recipients would lose eligibility for Medicaid, public housing, and the Food Stamp Program as their welfare benefits and earnings catapulted them above the eligibility ceiling of these programs. Loss of these benefits would, they argued, severely jeopardize recipients’ incentives to work. * Many liberal senators also attacked FAP because trade unions, which supported the minimum wage, objected to provisions that required federal authorities to pay only the prevailing wages in local jurisdictions. The National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), the grassroots protest movement of welfare recipients, contended that the national minimum benefit should be significantly increased and also objected to work requirements in the legislation. Most members of NWRO, who resided in Northern cities within high-benefit states, would have obtained little direct benefit from FAP, which emphasized improvement of benefits in low- benefit states in the South. NWRO leaders sought amendments to increase benefit levels, weaken the work requirement, expand day care provisions, and raise wage levels in public service jobs. * Despite this sniping from both conservatives and liberals, FAP came surprisingly close to passage, thanks to numerous amendments that the administration introduced to appease both factions; however, it finally lost a decisive vote in the Senate in 1970. Reintroduced with minor changes in 1971, it was caught in an even more furious exchange between liberals and conservatives and was finally defeated in 1972. * FAP’s demise was hastened by lack of constituency support; some key legislators noted that they did not receive a single supportive letter in 1971. An important policy reform was nonetheless achieved. An obscure provision attached to the welfare reform measure in 1971 proposed to replace the adult welfare programs of Old Age Assistance, Aid to the Blind, and Aid to the Disabled with the Supplementary Security Income (SSI) program. * Although FAP was defeated, its SSI provision was enacted in 1972. SSI proposed to federalize these adult programs, just as FAP had proposed to federalize AFDC; but older persons and those with disabilities were not associated with the long tradition of controversy that had beset AFDC beneficiaries, who were variously accused of malingering, seeking welfare funds to have more kids, and leading immoral lives. The federal government assumed responsibility for most of the welfare costs for these adult recipients under SSI. Because the Social Security Administration and its local offices administered SSI rather than local welfare offices, elderly citizens were spared the stigma visited upon welfare recipients. The legislation rescued older persons from the often punitive federal–state Old Age Assistance program, assisted hundreds of thousands of deinstitutionalized persons with mental disorders, and provided funds for many persons with physical disabilities, including Vietnam vets. Over the years, the SSI rolls expanded considerably—from 3.1 million persons in 1970 to 4.1 million persons in 1980 to roughly 8.3 million in 2015. * SSI nonetheless had serious flaws. Elderly persons and those with disabilities were allowed to keep their homes and could not have their estates attached, but they were not entitled to use food stamps. Grants were hardly munificent. Additionally, elderly persons who lived in states that did not supplement the federal minimum benefits received lower benefits than their peers in more generous states. The early federal guidelines that defined mental and physical disability were vague; Presidents Carter and Reagan instituted guidelines and procedures that discontinued grants to tens of thousands of persons with serious disabilities. * Democrats had initiated and received political credit for the Food Stamp Program when it was enacted in 1964. They continued their leadership in this area when George McGovern, the liberal Democratic senator, held hearings during the late 1960s on issues of nutrition and hunger in the United States. * He contended that the Food Stamp Program addressed the nutritional needs of only a small fraction of hungry Americans. Furthermore, conservatives had shown that the eligibility criteria for food stamps did not mesh with the FAP criteria. Nixon believed that he could solve the technical problems of food stamps and regain the initiative from the Democrats by federalizing food stamps, establishing national eligibility standards, making participation in the program mandatory for all states, and developing a revised benefit schedule that would provide additional benefits to families with no earned income, as well as larger families. By securing these bold changes, Nixon transformed food stamps from a welfare program to a program used by large numbers of the working poor. * These liberal reforms were enacted in 1970 and 1973 and dramatically increased the size of the program—from average participation of 4.3 million in 1970 to 21.1 million enrollees in 1980 to 44.2 million in 2016. * A broad constituency of protest groups, liberals, agricultural interests, and conservative politicians from rural areas supported these reforms. Understand Social Security Congress had periodically revised Social Security benefits upward to compensate for their erosion by inflation; this ritual was used by both Democrats and Republicans to garner support from elderly constituents. But members of both parties saw a need to index benefits—that is, to adjust benefits automatically and annually so as to compensate for the erosion in their value due to inflation. Nixon proposed a small benefit increase in Social Security and indexing in 1972. However, Wilbur Mills, a Democratic congressman with presidential aspirations, realized that championing the needs of elderly voters would benefit Democrats in the 1972 elections and consequently proposed not only indexing but also a 20% increase in benefits! * Such generous increases would normally have required major increases in payroll taxes. However, Mills refrained from proposing such tax increases, in part to avoid the ensuing political outcry but also because actuaries for the Social Security Administration, whose new economic models were based on overoptimistic assumptions, predicted that the trust fund would remain solvent even with massive increases in benefits. Nixon decided to support Mills’s proposals, so as to obtain partial credit for them and to compensate for the defeat of FAP, which had deprived his administration of credit for a major social reform. * Everyone realized that indexing would increase benefits, but virtually no one predicted that the onset of double-digit inflation in the 1970s would lead to extraordinary increases in Social Security benefits—or that the technical formulas used to compute benefit increases would allow these increases even to exceed rates of inflation. * The old system of incremental and periodic benefit increases had been replaced by an automatic system that led to rapid increases in benefits without associated increases in payroll taxes. Furthermore, an increase in the ratio of benefit receivers to employed workers also depleted the fund. Benefit outlays of the Social Security LO 8-3 program increased from $33 billion in 1970 to $124 billion in 1980 to $922 billion in 2016. * As with FAP and SSI, competitive bidding between the two parties and Nixon’s desire to expand the base of the Republican Party led a conservative president to support massive increases in social spending. Nixon’s failure to increase payroll taxes, when coupled with a steady decline in the proportion of wage earners to retirees, ensured the emergence of a funding crisis for Social Security, which had to be addressed by subsequent presidents. However, largely as a result of the Social Security increases the percentage of elderly persons below the poverty line decreased from 29.5% to 15% between 1967 and 1979—and to less than 5% when the value of in-kind benefits, such as medical care, was included. Understand Revenue Sharing and Social Services In response to Republican concerns that the New Deal and the Great Society had concentrated excessive power in the federal bureaucracy, Nixon developed the idea of revenue sharing. He proposed to give federal funds directly to local units of government, with few strings attached, so that local officials could decide how they wished to use them. Nixon also had more sinister motivations for this policy. He had become increasingly paranoid about the federal bureaucracy in his first 3 years of office and was convinced that federal bureaucrats, in liaison with sympathetic legislators and supportive (liberal) interest groups, had wrested power from him. By giving funds directly to the local and state units of government, he hoped to bypass the federal bureaucracy and even, to some extent, the Congress, which no longer would be able to develop specific programs. (Congress would merely allocate funds that local governments could use, more or less, as they pleased. * ) The Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 gave funds to local governments to use for their operating expenses. To supplement this general revenue sharing, Nixon also proposed special revenue sharing, in the form of six block grants to local governments to provide resources in broad areas such as housing and job training. This special revenue sharing would, Nixon argued, eventually replace many of the existing federal programs, which he portrayed as encumbered by excessive federal rules, guidelines, and regulations. * Why not, he asked, simultaneously terminate some existing programs and give local governments relatively unrestricted funds to spend on broad program areas? He had little success in obtaining special revenue sharing, however, because many members of Congress did not want to relinquish their control of federal programs and feared that some states would deny support to relatively powerless groups who benefited from LO 8-4 existing federal programs. Nixon obtained passage of only two special revenue-sharing programs, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973 and the Community Development Block Grant portion of the Housing and Community Development Act (CDBG) of 1974. General and special revenue sharing were suited to Nixon’s political strategy, for they represented a brand of social reform that was different from traditional Democratic programs. Some of Lyndon Johnson’s advisors, notably economist Walter Heller, had themselves urged passage of revenue sharing, but Johnson had demurred in favor of traditional categorical programs. * The policy field was thus open to Nixon, and he seized the opportunity to enact his version of reform. By so doing, Nixon hoped to gain the support of state and local officials, who liked revenue sharing because it augmented their funds with fewer strings attached. Between 1973 and 1980, the federal government paid roughly $6 billion a year in general revenue sharing to local governments, which substantially eased their fiscal problems during the 1970s. * Critics noted, however, that local authorities often did not use these resources to help disadvantaged citizens. In one city, CDBG funds were used to build a municipal golf course! Job-training programs had proliferated in a disorderly fashion during the 1960s. Nixon proposed to consolidate them in the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). The administrative mechanism devised for CETA vested considerable power in state and local organizations, known as prime sponsors, which issued contracts with public agencies and industry to provide jobs and job training. Under Title VI, CETA subsidized hundreds of thousands of public service jobs in both public and nonprofit agencies. These jobs were not means-tested; applicants had merely to demonstrate that they were unemployed. Incredibly, a Republican president had proposed and obtained enactment of a proposal that recalled the public works programs of the 1930s. * As we discussed in Chapter 7 , Congress gave states 75% matching funds in 1962 to provide social services to existing or potential recipients of AFDC. Some states seemed unaware of the legislation or used the money only for traditional services, such as home visits to AFDC recipients; however, discerning policy analysts in various states, including California, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington, realized that they could use these funds to develop a range of programs. Furthermore, when a federal administrator who prized expansiveness replaced a cost-conscious one, the use of the funds increased dramatically; some state officials were allowed to use the funds for drug, mental health, public education, and even highway construction programs. * In 1972, the Nixon administration sought to place a ceiling on this runaway program. To protect the program and to counter HEW regulations that limited its services to persons currently receiving or applying for welfare, the Congress created Title XX of the Social Security Act, which allocated funds to states according to a prescribed formula for use—with broad latitude by each state—in programs to enhance individuals’ ability to be self-supporting, family care or self-care, community-based care, and institutional care. The legislation was enacted in 1974. * States usually chose relatively traditional services, such as day care, that were provided by established agencies. To impose discipline on the program, a ceiling of $2.5 billion was established for annual expenditures—a figure that remained relatively constant in succeeding years. Title XX represented the first time that the federal government had officially committed itself to funding a variety of social services to persons who were usually near or under the poverty line. It also illustrated the reformist nature of Nixon’s first term. Nixon, who despised services and social workers, did not veto legislation that covered services for existing and potential welfare recipients in a block grant. Discuss Civil Rights Nixon’s strange mixture of conservative rhetoric and liberal deeds was nowhere more conspicuous than in civil rights. Nixon had won five Southern states in the presidential election of 1968 and hoped to increase his Southern gains in 1972, but he feared that George Wallace would again try to sweep the South by supporting racist policies. Thus, Nixon did not support desegregation of Southern schools in 1969 and 1970. He fired a liberal attorney in the Justice Department who favored cutting federal funds from segregated districts, and he supported a proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit busing. Nixon often used rhetoric that relied on code words—for example, “the silent majority of law-abiding citizens”—to appeal to racial animosities in the broader population. Yet some commentators believe that Nixon’s policies on racial issues constitute a strength of his administration. * When federal courts insisted that intentional segregation had to be terminated, Nixon finally relented and empowered George Shultz, his secretary of labor, to organize a series of Southern committees that succeeded in securing voluntary desegregation. When the number of African American students in segregated Southern schools was reduced from 68% in 1968 to 8% in 1972, the cycle of reform in the South that had begun with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was completed. * Nixon’s successes in the South were not matched by similar efforts in the North, where he chose to oppose busing to combat the de facto segregation. However, federal courts issued rulings in the 1970s and 1980s that led to the massive use of busing in Northern cities to desegregate schools—a policy that proved to be exceedingly controversial. Indeed, extensive “white flight” to suburban areas and to private schools ensued in the next three decades; however, he chose not to use busing to combat de facto segregation. LO 8-5 Between 1971 and 1974, Congress and the administration enacted a variety of laws and administrative measures that prohibited gender-based discrimination in training programs and employment. HEW instituted legal action to force colleges to end discrimination against women, just as the Supreme Court struck down various local laws that discriminated against women. The Justice Department brought suit against such corporations as American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) and won large awards for women who had been denied promotions. Women made extraordinary gains in obtaining training and membership in the professions and business. * Nixon approved the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, which gave the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the power to use court rulings to enforce its orders. His administration included women in affirmative action orders that were sent to federal contractors. * Moreover, the Nixon administration developed the so-called Philadelphia plan, which required building contractors that obtained federal contracts to institute affirmative action—a policy stoutly opposed by trade unions. This plan was subsequently extended to all federal contractors, as well as to state and local employees such as local police and fire departments. (These policies led to extraordinary increases in the employment of people of color and women by public agencies. * ) The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was a historic measure to accord persons with disabilities protections from discrimination (see Figure 8.1 ). Section 504 states that “no otherwise qualified handicapped individual … shall … be excluded from participating in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal assistance.” This legislation, as well as associated lawsuits, led to massive efforts to make buildings, public transportation, and jobs accessible to persons with disabilities. * Funds were appropriated to assist the mainstreaming of students with disabilities in public schools under the Education for All Handicapped Act of 1975. * Figure 8.1. Details AP Images/Joe Marquette Championing the rights of physically challenged persons. Evaluate Health Policy and Other Legislation Various health and family measures were enacted during Nixon’s administration. Medicare was revised in 1973 to extend coverage to nonelderly persons with kidney disease. The Health Maintenance Act of 1973 provided seed money to promote the establishment of medical organizations funded by annual payments from enrollees rather than traditional fee-for-service payments. * The Family Planning and Population Research Act of 1970 had helped 4 million low-income women, including 1.3 million teenagers, obtain family-planning services by 1980. * The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act of 1974 provided resources to local juvenile diversion projects to help runaways and truants who had previously been stigmatized by court and juvenile detention services. * The Child Abuse Prevention Act of 1974 provided research funds to be disseminated to universities and pilot projects to develop effective interventions. * The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) was landmark legislation that propelled the federal government into oversight of safety standards in American industry, in an era when toxic chemicals and new technology demanded new protections. The Department of Labor was charged with devising standards and establishing local agencies to implement inspection. * Finally, legislation enacted in 1975 established an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Workers who earned less than $4,000 per year were given a tax credit (a payment) equivalent to 10% of their earnings. Though modest, it was the first legislation to use the tax system as a vehicle for giving resources to the poor. In succeeding decades, it became a massive antipoverty program as the credits were increased— eventually the largest one. In 2015, it lifted 31.8 million persons from poverty or made them less poor. An additional 13.2 million children were lifted from poverty or made less poor by the Child Tax Credit, enacted in 2003, for which adult LO 8-6 taxpayers can obtain if they earned less than $55,000 in 2016 (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “Policy Basics: The Earned Income Tax Credit,” accessed at cbpp.org on 6/24/17).Housing Legislation The United States had developed public housing projects for poor and elderly persons since the 1930s, but it had not evolved a system for subsidizing the rents of tenants in housing owned by private landlords. This was a serious omission because it meant that low-income tenants had to live in public housing projects—often segregated by class and race—rather than having a range of housing choices that included living in mixed-income and integrated neighborhoods. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 established the Section 8 housing program to pay up to 70% of the housing costs of tenants who rent from private landlords. It is administered by local public housing authorities. Eligibility is determined by the household income of tenants— with most families having incomes not exceeding 30% of the median income for a specific geographic area. Section 8 provided, then, vouchers to low-income families—and came to serve 1.8 million persons by 2004 with appropriations of roughly $17 billion—or $20 billion by 2016. Even with these resources, only a small fraction of low-income persons are served by the program, which has long waiting lists in most jurisdictions. Critique Nixon’ s Shift from Reform to Conservatism EP 1a EP 2a EP 3a EP 5a Social reform flourished in the first 3 years of Nixon’s first term. Spending for poverty programs had increased by $27 billion in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations (in 1986 dollars), but it increased by $54 billion in the Nixon and Ford administrations. * When confronted with a deep recession, trade deficits, and inflation, Nixon even imposed wage and price controls in 1971. * But during this liberal period, Nixon’s rhetoric remained staunchly conservative, even as he supported reform measures; he regularly lambasted programs of the Great Society, “big spenders,” and liberalism and remained silent on the subjects of civil rights and race relations. He repeatedly attacked service programs staffed by social workers, child development specialists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and community activists. He believed that these programs were ineffective, coddled the poor, and represented a misguided Democratic approach to social reform. He sought major reductions in federal funding of neighborhood health centers, community action programs, and community mental health centers. LO 8-7 * Head Start was saved from massive cuts only because of its extraordinary political popularity. Nixon’s antipathy to service programs was illustrated by his veto of child development legislation in 1971. The Head Start program had stimulated interest in expanding funding for preschool, day care, regional planning, and advocacy services for children, and some experts were convinced that many families were endangered by high divorce rates and women’s increasing rates of employment. In that context, legislation was initiated in House and Senate committees to provide a variety of free or low-cost services to American families. It was the veto of this legislation that partly led Marian Wright Edelman to find the Children’s Defense Fund in 1973 (see Insert 8.3 ). Insert 8.3. Proﬁles in Policy Practice and Advocacy: Marian W right Edelman (1939–) Marian Wright Edelman—civil rights activist, lawyer, children’s rights crusader, and organization founder—was born in Bennettsville, South Carolina, on June 6, 1939, the youngest of five children born to Maggie Leola (Bowen) Wright and Arthur Jerome Wright. A minister of the Shiloh Baptist Church and an adherent of Booker T. Washington’s self-help philosophy, Edelman’s father was a major influence in her life and thought. He expected his children to get an education and devote themselves to the betterment of their community. She successfully met both expectations and continues to work toward the betterment of her world even today. In 1956, after graduating from Marlboro Training High School, Edelman entered Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. Her outstanding scholarship won her a Charles Merrill study/travel grant for study abroad. During the first summer of her junior year, Marian studied French civilization at Sorbonne University. She spent the remainder of that academic year at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. For two months during her second semester abroad, she studied in the Soviet Union under a Lisle Fellowship. In 1959, the year of the first student protests in the South, she returned to Spelman for her senior year and became active in the civil rights movement. Before graduating in 1960, she would participate in one of the largest sit-ins at the Atlanta City Hall, and, along with 14 other students, be arrested for protesting the civil rights abuses occurring throughout the South. Her involvement in the civil rights movement made her aware of the fact that there was a scarcity of civil rights lawyers. Thus, Edelman decided to sacrifice her aspirations for a career in foreign service and instead pursued a career as a civil rights attorney. In 1960, after graduating as valedictorian of her Spelman class, she was admitted to Yale University Law School as a John Hay Whitney Fellow. In 1963, her last spring break of law school, she went to Mississippi and participated in the voter registration drives sponsored by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Following her graduation from Yale and a year’s training in New York, Edelman went to Jackson, Mississippi, where she was one of the first two NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund interns. By the summer of 1964, she had opened a law office and was busy handling civil rights cases, most of which involved getting students out of jail. Because of her role as a leading supporter of the civil rights movement, she was often thrown into jail. Moreover, she was prohibited from entering a state courthouse to aid her clients until she took and passed the Mississippi bar. Edelman became the first African American woman to pass the bar in the state of Mississippi. In addition to the work she did at her own law office, she headed the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund in Mississippi from 1964 to 1968. Her efforts to effect positive change in the South led her to realize that, to improve the civil rights situation in the South, she would have to begin working on reforming federal civil rights policy. In March 1968, after receiving a Field Foundation grant to learn how to effect positive changes in the law for the benefit of the poor, Edelman moved to Washington, DC, and launched the Washington Research Project. In July of 1968, Marian Wright married Peter Edelman, who was one of Robert Kennedy’s legislative assistants working on the Senate’s Subcommittee on Employment, Manpower, and Poverty. In 1971, the Edelmans left Washington and moved to Boston, where she became director of the Harvard University Center for Law and Education. One of Edelman’s greatest achievements was the founding of the Children’s Defense Fund (CDF) in 1973. The CDF is a nonprofit child advocacy organization based in Washington, DC. It was designed to provide systematic and long-term assistance to children and adolescents and to ensure that their needs are an important matter of public policy. Some of the children’s issues the CDF has brought to the attention of the American public include teen pregnancy, the child care situation, child welfare and mental health, and family support systems. The CDF, under Edelman’s leadership, has served as one of the most visibly active and successful organizations concerned with a broad range of children’s and family issues. Today, the CDF’s primary mission is to teach the American public about the needs children have and promote preventive intervention in children’s lives before it is too late to rescue them from treatable diseases, dropping out of school, early pregnancies, and other problems children and adolescents face. The CDF is also a primary source of information for government officials and often lobbies Congress through continuing research and its authoritative reports. The Children’s Defense Fund (CDF) is one of the preeminent advocacy groups in the United States—operating not only out of Washington, DC, but through various of its state chapters. Marian Wright Edelman is an assertive, knowledgeable, and experienced advocate with many policy victories throughout her career. Edelman illustrates the importance of persistence in policy advocacy. While policy advocates sometimes achieve rapid victories in a specific legislative season, they often must engage in advocacy for specific issues for extended periods as they gradually develop supportive coalitions, educate lawmakers, and surmount opposition. In Edelman’s case, for example, she was instrumental in securing federal subsidies for child care in 1990—but only after a 20-year struggle marked by many setbacks. That’s why policy advocates often work with or support specific advocacy groups such as the CDF—because they possess the staying power to advance specific policy issues over relatively long periods of time. The CDF has undertaken hundreds of research projects to document children’s needs and to evaluate the effectiveness of specific policies. These data greatly increase its clout when it seeks policy changes. You can find some of its findings at its website: http://www.childrensdefense.org . It was uncertain whether Nixon would support this legislation. When his HEW secretary, Elliot Richardson, insisted in 1971 that the legislation be amended to make it more acceptable to the administration, some observers took this as a promising sign. But Nixon vetoed it, with conservative language that reflected the ideology of the right wing of the Republican Party. He charged that the legislation would destroy the institution of the family, which should be retained “in its rightful position as the keystone of our civilization [and] would commit the vast moral authority to [institutional] child rearing as against the family-centered approach.” It was a devastating blow to reformers, who were unable to obtain similar legislation in succeeding years. * A changing political climate shaped Nixon’s decision by the summer of 1972—and even more obviously by the fall of 1973—to disavow new social legislation. It had been reasonable to assume in 1968, after the Great Society, that blue-collar and white ethnic Americans could be wooed by social initiatives like FAP, SSI, national health insurance, and the indexing of Social Security. Partly because of the conservative rhetoric of Nixon and Agnew, however, many white ethnic, blue-collar, and middle-class persons had become preoccupied with issues of crime, inflation, and government spending by 1972 and had become resentful of African Americans, who were, they believed, receiving unwarranted or disproportionate benefits from federal programs. The term white backlash has been used to characterize the resentments of these citizens. * White Americans had also become alarmed by the tactics and language used by the various reform groups that had emerged in the late 1960s. * The new militancy of these groups stemmed in considerable measure from disillusionment with the Great Society. African Americans realized that the civil rights gains of the 1960s, which had largely addressed legal and overt discrimination in the South, had not slowed the segregation of African Americans into urban ghettoes or the expansion of an African American underclass, whose members had limited education and high unemployment and often depended on AFDC, the former Food Stamp Program, and other social programs. Leaders of vulnerable populations—African Americans, women, Latinos, Native Americans, gay men and lesbians, and people with disabilities—spoke of their feelings of inferiority that stemmed from living in a society that overtly or covertly discriminated against them. African Americans urged one another to develop pride in their race and heritage; women advocated feminist education to develop solidarity; Native Americans and Latinos organized protests against government officials, schools, and universities; leaders of the gay and lesbian communities urged their members to declare their sexual orientations publicly and pressured politicians and employers to end discriminatory practices; and people with disabilities demanded access to jobs, buildings, and public transportation. Efforts to mobilize these populations alienated many white Americans, who resented the separatism and the challenge to dominant policies that the new rhetoric implied (see Insert 8.4 ). Insert 8.4. Ethical Analysis of Political Tactics Nixon and Agnew aggressively sought to pull white Americans from the Democratic Party by appealing to their anger and fears—and their racism. Are these tactics unethical? To what extent do members of both parties engage in them? To what extent has President Barack Obama been the target of these tactics? Nixon and Agnew realized that they could exploit this situation for their political benefit. * Why not, they reasoned, condemn the rhetoric and tactics of reformist groups to turn working-class and middle-class persons against activists and reformers? Why not try to identify the Democratic Party with these groups—and themselves with “the silent majority of law-abiding citizens”? Their resolve was strengthened when public opinion polls indicated that crime and inflation were the issues of most concern to many Americans, who believed that civil rights, social spending, and social reform efforts had proceeded too rapidly. These sentiments were linked to the growing economic distress of stagflation, the combination of high unemployment and inflation. * Economic stagnation made some blue-collar Americans fear that African Americans, women, and others might take jobs from them, and inflation reduced the real income of many families and made credit hard to obtain as interest rates soared. Furthermore, many Americans believed that the only way to decrease the rate of inflation was to cut social spending (see Insert 8.5 ). * Insert 8.5. Critical Analysis: What Created White Backlash? People in the working class or in the lower middle class ought, in theory, to support social programs. Possessing relatively meager resources and experiencing job insecurity, they or their family members sometimes use social programs such as Medicaid and SNAP (formerly known as Food Stamp Program), just as their parents use Medicare. Yet white backlash developed most acutely in this group, such as Catholic voters in the North and white bluecollar voters in the South. Its most celebrated representative was the fictional character Archie Bunker from the TV show All in the Family . Analyze why this group, whose ancestors had often been part of the Roosevelt coalition in the New Deal, became disenchanted with the American welfare state, often voted for presidential candidates such as George Wallace in the 1960s, Richard Nixon in the 1970s, and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, and granted Newt Gingrich a Republican landslide in the 1994 congressional elections and George W. Bush in elections of 2000 and 2004. After many of these persons voted for Barack Obama in 2008, considerable numbers of them voted for Republicans in 2010, 2014, and 2016. 1. What, if anything, might reformers have done differently to retain the goodwill of this group? 2. Did Donald Trump win the election of 2016 because of white backlash reflected by dislike of immigrants and prejudice against persons of color? Nixon was also quick to capitalize on developments within the Democratic Party. Following the 1968 election, Democrats made a concerted effort to increase participation by African Americans, women, and others in party councils at the expense of the power of incumbent politicians and power brokers, such as Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago. These reforms, however, boosted the political fortunes of Richard Nixon, who was able to argue that the Democratic Party had been taken over by special interests. When the party reforms allowed a particularly liberal senator—George McGovern— to obtain the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1972, Nixon portrayed him as an extremist who was beholden to these interests. * Republican conservatives, who believed that they represented the mainstream of the party, also promoted Nixon’s conservative policies. At first, Nixon’s conservative advisors, such as the economists Arthur Burns and Martin Anderson, had been outflanked by liberal advisors, such as Robert Finch, Daniel Moynihan, and Elliot Richardson; but there was a definite thinning in the ranks of liberal advisors as Nixon’s first term progressed. Indeed, by 1972, conservative John Ehrlichman emerged as Nixon’s leading advisor on domestic matters. * Soon after his reelection in 1972, Nixon began a personal war against liberals that was motivated by his political decision to move toward the right, to fight inflation with budget cuts, and to discipline federal civil servants, who, he had come to believe, colluded with special interests and liberal congressional aides to resist the implementation of conservative policies. Nixon manipulated the civil service system to place into office conservative persons of dubious merit, impounded funds that had already been appropriated by Congress for social programs, proposed significant decreases in the funds of most major programs, and demanded a drastic reduction of the federal workforce. Because many members of Congress and the federal bureaucracy were embittered by these tactics, an atmosphere of suspicion and polarization developed in the Capitol. * Huge battles over national priorities took place from 1971 onward as Nixon vetoed many budget recommendations of the Congress on the grounds they gave too much money to the nonentitlement portion of the domestic agenda. Social spending increased markedly in the Nixon years, primarily due to a dramatic rise in spending on entitlements, which more than doubled between 1960 and 1975. (Indeed, total spending on entitlements actually exceeded total spending on the military and related spending in 1974.) Moreover, military spending markedly declined as American involvement in Vietnam diminished and finally ended by early 1973. When spending on entitlements is aggregated with spending on education, training, employment, and social programs, the American welfare state consumed almost 45% of the federal budget compared with less than 20% in 1960—a startling turnaround in fiscal terms. Yet Nixon established conditions that would lead to a battle for resources during the late 1970s and the 1980s. By cutting the military only back to the levels that had preceded the Vietnam confict in 1964 (when measured in constant dollars), he kept military spending at its Cold War levels even though many critics wondered why the United States needed such vast “overkill” of nuclear warheads. (The United States possessed more than 11,000 nuclear warheads in 1975 compared with less than 4,000 in the Soviet Union.) Many persons wondered, as well, why the United States did not insist that European nations carry a greater burden of their own defense rather than relying so heavily on the United States for ground and air forces. Nixon also waged war on a portion of the welfare state financed by so- called discretionary funding. If entitlements like Social Security, Medicare, and the former Food Stamp program are automatically funded by the federal government to the level of claimed benefits during a specific year, other domestic programs (such as education, training, employment, and social programs) are funded from the discretionary budget that Congress can control each year. Nixon repeatedly attacked these discretionary social programs as “ineffective” and “wasteful.” He often failed to spend the funds that Congress had appropriated for them in a practice known as impoundment. By arguing that they belonged under the purview of local and state governments, he implied that the federal government’s primary domestic obligation was to fund entitlements. Nixon’s attack on these discretionary social and educational programs was unwarranted. Persons desperately needed additional education and training to secure jobs that paid an adequate wage as increasing numbers of unionized, well-paying jobs disappeared in the United States when many American corporations located their assembly lines abroad and as Japanese and European corporations competed more effectively with American corporations. If persons who possessed a high school education had been able to find high- paying unionized assembly-line jobs in prior decades, they increasingly became unemployed or cast into low-wage service jobs in restaurants, emerging fast-food chains, or in malls. Such cities as Flint and Detroit, Michigan, which had been relatively affluent, became blighted with boarded-up stores, vacant houses, and growing poverty. Other social problems became more serious in the 1970s, such as substance abuse, which took a tragic toll on millions of Americans who became addicted to cocaine. With nearly two times the amount of revenues as all state and local governments put together, the federal government possessed resources desperately needed to upgrade an array of social programs in addition to funding entitlements. A good case can be made, then, that federal discretionary spending should have been markedly increased in the 1970s rather than bitterly assaulted by the incumbent president. Nixon’s effectiveness in waging this war against liberalism was stymied, however, by the aftermath of a break-in at the Democratic campaign headquarters in the Watergate Office Building in 1972. Investigations by the Justice Department and by Congress, which focused at first on the burglars, soon implicated presidential aides, cabinet officials, and Nixon himself. Nixon took actions that raised the ire of many Congressional members, such as firing a Special Prosecutor to investigate his involvement in the break-in and seeking to hide evidence such as tapes that recorded his discussions with subordinates who helped obscure evidence about his involvement in the break-in. The Congress was on the verge of impeachment proceedings when Nixon resigned from office in August of 1974 and was succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford. Review the Brief Reign of Gerald Ford Ford was a political conservative who had spent years in the Congress criticizing programs of the Great Society. He was, moreover, an unimaginative man who was unable to initiate legislation even when urged by his advisors. As did Nixon, he became even more conservative as his term progressed. Nelson Rockefeller, his vice president, pressured Ford to endorse urban development reforms, to expand health care, and to support other policy reforms, but Rockefeller’s power, as well as that of other liberal Republicans, was soon eclipsed in internal power struggles within the administration. * Ford’s major policy became the presidential veto, which he used with remarkable frequency to stymie legislation and spending increases proposed by Congress. Because of Democratic majorities in both houses, Congress was able to override a number of vetoes and to increase funding for school lunches, education, and health care programs. Ford finally realized that increases in social spending were needed to counter the deep recession of 1975, though Congress had to override his veto to establish a public works program to help the unemployed. His term can best be characterized as a continuing stalemate between conservatives and liberals over the size of social spending. * Little social legislation was enacted during Ford’s tenure. The Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which was passed in 1975, provided federal subsidies to schools so that children with physical and mental disabilities could be mainstreamed into regular classes. Although it allowed many children with disabilities to escape special institutions, inadequate funding in succeeding years much diminished its effects. * Jimmy Carter, a conservative Democratic governor from Georgia, was victorious over republican president Gerald Ford in the presidential election LO 8-8 of 1976.

Assess the Hidden Social Spending Revolution of the 1970s The policy changes that were made in the 1970s constitute a hidden social spending revolution in American social policy. Nondefense spending went from 8.1% of the gross national product in 1961 to 11.3% in 1971 and 15.6% in 1981. About two-thirds of this domestic budget consisted of social insurance and means-tested social programs. Total federal social spending rose from $67 billion in 1960 to $158 billion in 1970 (in 1980 dollars) and to $314 billion in 1980. * Many social programs grew tremendously in their total cost during the 1970s, as Table 8.2 illustrates. * LO 8-9 Table 8 .2 .

Many persons used only a single program. A man who became unemployed during the recession of 1976 might use only unemployment benefits because he considered use of the former Food Stamp Program or Medicaid programs to be unnecessary or stigmatizing or because his net income made him ineligible for them. Other families used only the former Food Stamps Program, and still others only received Medicaid. Other families qualified for Section 8 housing assistance. The wide range of cash transfer, in-kind, and services programs allowed families to select specific programs that improved their quality of life at a specific point in time. * Other consumers used combinations of programs. A single woman with several preschool or school-age children might receive AFDC, Food Stamps, and health services reimbursed by Medicaid and live in publicly 1970 1980 Federal Total Federal Total AFDC 5.1 9.2 8.8 13.9 CETA and MDTA 2.4 2.4 3.6 3.6 Social Security * 68.2 68.2 134.8 134.8 Housing assistance 2.8 2.8 4.9 4.9 Total 109.2 122.5 241.4 258.0 subsidized housing. An elderly family might use Medicare, SSI, and Social Security benefits. A young adult who had received a kidney transplant could receive SSI as well as medical services from Medicare. An unemployed person could receive unemployment insurance, job training from CETA, Food Stamps, and Medicaid. The availability of combinations of programs was crucial to many individuals and families—especially to large families, whose members needed a range of services and resources. * Many people used such programs as unemployment insurance, Food Stamps, and Medicaid for brief periods of unemployment, illness, or poverty; others needed assistance for longer periods. Of all the recipients of the nation’s welfare programs, about 50% used them for less than 3 years; about 33% used them for 3 to 7 years; and about 12% used them for 8 or more years. * Impoverished women with children were likely to use AFDC, Food Stamps, and Medicaid. Unemployed men tended to use unemployment insurance and Food Stamps. Elderly people used SSI, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Persons with disabilities used SSI and Social Security disability benefits. (The Social Security program had become far more than a pension program for elderly people by the 1970s because its benefits often subsidized surviving family members when a parent died and helped pay for the education of surviving children. * ) The programs were not used only by low-income persons; indeed, roughly 3 of every 4 dollars of social welfare benefits (whether cash, in-kind benefits, or services) were delivered in programs that were not means-tested, such as Medicare, Social Security, and unemployment insurance. * Government loan programs for college students were greatly expanded in the 1970s and were used extensively by middle- and even upper-income families. Countless people found their quality of life improved by receipt of cash, in- kind benefits, or services from one or more of the social programs. Evidence also suggests that extraordinary progress was made during the 1970s in reducing the incidence of poverty, as measured by the percentage of the population that fell under official poverty lines. By this measure, the poverty rate declined from 14.2% of the population in 1967 to 11.1% in 1979. When in-kind transfers, such as Food Stamps and Medicaid, are also included, the poverty rate declined to 6.4% in 1979—an extraordinary accomplishment. However, 15% of African Americans, 12% of Latinos, and 18% of female-headed households remained in poverty. * The reduction in poverty during the 1970s was even more impressive than the gains made during the 1960s, which were facilitated by the Vietnam conflict and the economic activity that accompanied it. Expenditures for the military declined from 8% of the gross national product (GNP) in 1966 to 5.5% of the GNP in 1981. * Indeed, in contrast to the boom of the 1960s, the economy was plagued by stagflation in the 1970s. The striking successes in reducing poverty in the 1970s can be attributed in considerable measure to expansion of cash and in-kind social programs. The average value of payments, benefits, and services to families and individuals was $1,252 in 1970 (in 1980 dollars), but it reached $1,896 in 1980. * Thus, progress in reducing poverty was made only because social programs were more comprehensive than during any other period in American history. Of course, increases in spending on entitlements did not address the job- related income of Americans. Because the United States had dominated world markets through the 1960s, few people realized that vast numbers of unionized, industrial jobs were disappearing, whether through migration of American firms abroad in search of cheaper labor or from competition with European nations and Japan. In the 1970s, little attention was given to job- training programs, improvements in public education, and relocation of jobs to inner-city areas. The progress in improving the economic status of Americans was accompanied by a revolution in human rights. Regulations and litigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) were supplemented by many court rulings that bolstered the rights of people of color and women in job markets and in college admissions. The rights of persons with physical and mental disabilities were advanced by important court decisions, by legislation, and by government regulations. These measures significantly decreased the extent to which people with disabilities were warehoused in custodial institutions and increased their access to public facilities. Advocates for gay men and lesbians defeated local government attempts to deny them teaching positions. Why Was the Spending Revolution Hidden? In the 1980s, secure in the knowledge that one of their own—Ronald Reagan—was in the White House, conservatives attacked social spending and the welfare state. They focused their attacks on the New Deal and Great Society reforms; however, they ought also to have attacked Richard Nixon and his presidential successors during the 1970s, who permitted startling increases in social spending that rivaled earlier periods of reform. Many factors combined to hide the extent of the 1970s reforms. Nixon’s political rhetoric was often conservative, in contrast to Franklin Roosevelt’s denunciation of “monied interests” and Johnson’s expressions of sympathy for those in poverty. Each of the three presidents in the 1970s began his administration with relatively liberal emphases but ended his term as a determined conservative, which made him appear to focus on reductions rather than increases in social spending. Nixon was far more conservative in his second term than in his first, Ford more conservative in 1976 than in 1975, and Carter more conservative after 1978 than in his first 2 years. * Each president was forced to abandon reform measures by his Southern constituencies, high inflation and deficits, and public indifference to reform. Moreover, the nature of the 1970s reforms tended to render them invisible. While Democrats had typically sought new programs, some of Nixon’s reforms—such as the indexing of Social Security, federalizing of Food Stamps, and SSI—were simply procedural and administrative changes in existing programs. Nixon’s reforms often had a conservative appearance because they deemphasized the role of the federal government; both CETA and revenue sharing allocated funds to localities. Such appearances are deceiving, however, because CETA and revenue sharing were substantial additions to the American welfare state, as Ronald Reagan realized a few years later when he succeeded in virtually eliminating them. Nixon’s reforms were also unobtrusive because they lacked a dramatic name like the New Deal. Finally, where the New Deal and Great Society reforms resulted from the successful mobilizing of a liberal coalition of unions, intellectuals, Jews, blue-collar voters, racial groups, and other interest groups against conservatives, passage of reforms in the 1970s often resulted from a more complex and less dramatic political process, in which members of both parties sought partial credit for reforms. Recognize the Oppression of V ulnerable Populations in the 1970s Oppression of W omen: The W omen’ s Movement EP 2a EP 3a Groups representing women, people of color, and gay men and lesbians made important changes in tactics and organization in the 1970s. The middle and late 1960s saw the emergence of relatively radical leadership who focused on nonviolent marches and demonstrations, building group pride, and recruiting mass membership. Among African Americans, the nonviolent precepts of Martin Luther King, Jr., were losing ground to the black power philosophy of Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael. In the mid-1970s, as this first wave of activists from vulnerable populations burned out, were intimidated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other federal officials, or became discouraged by intragroup dissension between radicals and those more inclined to accept incremental changes, they were replaced by a second wave. * It had also become clear by the mid-1970s that each of the vulnerable populations faced dauntingly complicated problems in obtaining legislative and legal advances— problems that could not easily be addressed by direct action. They needed to work on a number of fronts simultaneously, to obtain expert legal advice, LO 8-10 to surmount honest differences within their groups about how best to proceed, and to develop staying power as complex legal initiatives were processed and litigated. Indeed, within each movement, specialized groups that worked on specific issues supplemented the older general-purpose groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Organization for Women. The women’s movement illustrates this transformation of organizing in the 1970s (see Figure 8.2 ). Women found that they had to work on multiple fronts—to redress job discrimination, reform state laws on rape, develop funding for battered women’s shelters, seek resources for child care, obtain legislation allowing maternal (and paternal) leaves for pregnant women and for parents of newly born children, secure equal pay for comparable work, increase child support payments from divorced or absent fathers, increase training and assistance to “displaced homemakers,” work for enactment of an Equal Rights Amendment, develop lawsuits to force promotions and hiring of women in the face of discrimination, contest court rulings that threatened affirmative action, and seek legislation to ban sexual harassment in the workplace. Specialized organizations formed to deal with each of these issues; they developed loose connections with each other and with the National Organization for Women. * Figure 8.2. Details The National Archives The women’s liberation movement. The women’s movement also illustrates how different groups had to try to overcome dissent within their movement. African American women and other women of color sometimes contended that the leadership of the established groups was insensitive to their needs; thus, some African American women thought that more attention should be devoted to the needs of poor women and that radical feminists’ attacks on the institution of marriage did not reflect the interest of the African American community in supporting African American males within their marriages. * Old controversies resurfaced, such as those between women who favored protectionist legislation and women who favored strict equality for women and men. Although protectionists wanted legislation that gave women maternity leaves, custody rights, alimony, and child support, other women wanted legislation that gave men and women complete equality under the law—that is, that gave men and women equal rights to child support, alimony, support payments, and leaves. * Heterosexual women and lesbians disagreed about how much emphasis the women’s movement should place on fighting discrimination encountered by lesbians. The Mobilization of New Sets of V ulnerable Populations We discussed African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and women in Chapter 7 , but the members of other vulnerable populations also developed leadership and organizations in the late 1960s. Many policies that affected older persons were developed in the 1960s and early 1970s, including Medicare, the Older Americans Act, SSI, and indexing of Social Security benefits. * A “gray lobby” was energized by rapid growth in the membership of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC), the Gray Panthers, and many other groups. * Indeed, by the 1980s, AARP used its vast resources to mobilize support for those legislators who were sympathetic to programs that benefited older persons. In the 1960s, automobile accidents and the Vietnam conflict led to substantial increases in the numbers of Americans with disabilities. Toward the end of the decade, a robust movement to assert the rights of people with disabilities developed. Various groups had long represented veterans with disabilities, persons with vision and hearing impairment, those with developmental disabilities, and people with specific diseases such as cerebral palsy. However, none of these groups focused on the civil rights of persons with disabilities. Although long-standing programs such as the federal vocational rehabilitation program already provided services to persons with physical disabilities, the emerging interest in extending their rights was first reflected in the 1968 Architectural Barriers Act, which promoted the modification of federal facilities. Various local groups with an interest in civil rights, such as the Center for Independent Living in Berkeley, California, developed in the 1960s and early 1970s. Persons with disabilities came to be concerned about discrimination in the workplace and about the many physical impediments—such as the absence of ramps and elevators—that made their access to transportation and facilities problematic. However, there was little networking among individuals with different disabilities until 1972, when President Nixon vetoed the Rehabilitation Act. In response, an array of persons demonstrated in support of the legislation at the annual conference of the President’s Committee on Employment of the Handicapped. The disability movement took off after the enactment of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, whose Section 504 prohibited discrimination against persons with disabilities. The American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities (ACCD) sought to pressure the Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations to put resources, legal advocacy, and commitment behind the civil rights provisions of the act. * Americans had lagged behind Europeans in developing child-care and children’s allowances, but little pressure was placed on federal politicians prior to the mid-1960s, except by small professional organizations such as the Child Welfare League of America. A White House Conference on Children was held about every 10 years, but it tended to be a symbolic event. The establishment of the Head Start program in 1964 provided a dramatic breakthrough for children, even if it was poorly funded. As we have discussed, President Nixon’s veto of child development legislation in 1971 provided the impetus for the founding of the Children’s Defense Fund in 1973 by Marian Wright Edelman—the most assertive advocate for children in Washington, DC, during the next two decades. Over the years, various coalitions of professional groups banded together to seek passage of measures such as the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980. Child advocacy groups developed in local and state jurisdictions as well. Unlike groups with mass memberships, such as AARP, advocates for children had to depend on the goodwill and interest of other groups, such as the National Organization for Women, which often gave relatively little attention to the needs of children. * The 1970s as a Revolution in Rights Although civil rights are commonly associated with the pivotal Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, the rights revolution reached its zenith in the mid- 1970s. Working with advocacy groups or within the Justice Department itself, attorneys who had received their training in the civil rights movement of the 1960s developed a vast quantity of litigation for the various outgroups. As one example, in O’Connor v. Donaldson , the Supreme Court ruled that individuals who are placed in mental institutions have a right to treatment and cannot simply be warehoused, as had often been done. Other rulings extended protections to immigrants in detention camps, to gay men and lesbians, to persons with physical disabilities, to the indigent, to persons with developmental disabilities, to persons in jail, and to prisoners on death row. The federal courts required the Justice Department to enforce their orders outlawing segregated school systems in the South. The courts also required Northern schools to end de facto segregation, often by means of busing. Women won class action lawsuits against corporations such as AT&T, which were required to make back payments of huge sums of money to women who had been unfairly denied promotions or who had encountered wage discrimination. The Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling disallowed state laws that prohibited abortion during the first trimester. The building trades, which had historically excluded people of color and women from apprenticeship programs and jobs, were the subject of Court judgments that forced them to train minorities and women. Litigation promoted by the Age Discrimination Act of 1967 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 required some employers to hire or retain elderly persons and persons with disabilities. * Advocates found a generally receptive response from the Supreme Court even after Earl Warren’s retirement as chief justice in 1969 and his replacement by Warren Burger, who remained chief justice until 1986. This explosion of litigation and rulings was supplemented by the growth of government regulatory bodies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, whose budget rose from $3.25 million in 1966 to $111.4 million in 1979. Court rulings and regulatory pressure had a marked impact on the decisions of colleges, corporations, and public agencies such as fire and police departments. For example, the percentage of African American police officers in Atlanta increased from 10% to 29.9% between 1968 and 1975. * The Beginnings of Backlash Each of the outgroups obtained policy successes in the 1970s and 1980s, but each also encountered a significant backlash from conservatives and movements that opposed social change. In the case of women, Phyllis Schlafly became an outspoken critic of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), as well as several other policy measures that feminists sought. Schlafly wanted to preserve traditional sex roles and was convinced that the ERA would force women to take jobs to provide half the family’s income, end laws that gave mothers custody of children, and deprive them of the right to obtain alimony. * During the 1970s and 1980s, many conservatives shared her opposition to policies that feminists sought. Republican legislators, hopeful of gaining votes from low- and moderate- income whites who believed they were losing jobs to people of color, mounted a vigorous attack on affirmative action as well as busing. Leaders of the building trades often chose to disregard federal regulations until forced to act by litigation or federal regulators. Persons with disabilities encountered resistance from many colleges and some employers, who made little effort to make buildings accessible and jobs available to them. At one point, frustrated by this resistance, they orchestrated a sit-down strike in the office of the HEW secretary to force the drafting of regulations to implement the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. * Gay men and lesbians encountered a backlash orchestrated by the New Right. Gay rights ordinances were repealed in 1977 and 1978 in Dade County, Florida; St. Paul, Minnesota; Wichita, Kansas; and Eugene, Oregon. In the late 1970s, a California legislator mounted a campaign for a ballot initiative to prohibit gay men and lesbians from teaching in public schools. Harvey Milk, a gay member of the board of supervisors in San Francisco, was assassinated in 1978, along with the city’s mayor, who supported gay and lesbian issues. * We can’t understand the victory of Donald Trump to the presidency in 2016 without understanding white backlash during the 1970s. Richard Nixon used the term “the silent majority of law-abiding citizens” to describe white people who rebelled against civil rights. They found their champion in Donald Trump, although I argue in Chapter 13 that Trump failed to enact policies that addressed their lack of employment, their substance abuse, and other problems in the first year of his presidency. Understand the Evolution of the Reluctant Welfare State We have emphasized the hidden nature of social reforms in the 1970s, but we can also discern in this paradoxical era the harbingers of a more conservative time. Though Nixon often supported, and even initiated, social reforms, his rhetoric in public utterances, as well as during private conferences with advisors, reflected racism and anti-Semitism. Although he supported the Family Assistance Plan, he also led highly publicized efforts to attack welfare fraud. He sometimes supported policies for women and other groups, but he also endorsed FBI infiltration of dissident groups. His brooding presence symbolizes the contradictions of the 1970s; he balanced conservative rhetoric and support of social initiatives in his first term, only to swing decisively toward conservative policies in his second term. As we have noted, Presidents Ford and Carter were basically conservative in their domestic policies, even though they supported certain reforms. Full-fledged conservative movements against the supposed excesses of reform emerged in the form of a backlash against feminism, affirmative action, social spending, and taxes, so that advocates for women, gay men and lesbians, and people of color felt increasingly on the defensive. With the end of the Vietnam conflict, major and ongoing reductions in military spending were expected. Sharp reductions did occur and were used to fund increases in social spending during the decade. By the mid-1970s, however, some Americans became convinced that the Soviet Union, which had dramatically increased the number and power of its missiles, threatened to overtake the American lead in military weapons. Angered by several arms control treaties, which they believed made undue concessions to the Russians, these Americans led a crusade to dramatically increase military spending—a plea that fell on the receptive ears of Ronald Reagan, who LO 8-11 made increases in military spending a major pledge in his campaign of 1980. * Historians sometimes err by characterizing historical eras as liberal or conservative. The decade of the 1970s was a peculiar mixture of both of these tendencies. Major policy reforms took place but in the context of a nation with an emerging conservative movement, which came to view even Richard Nixon as too liberal. Conservatives confidently awaited the 1980 presidential election, and they were not disappointed by the results. Link the Paradoxical Era to Contemporary Society What W e Can Learn from Policy Advocates of the Paradoxical Era EP 1a EP 2c EP 4a EP 5a EP 5b Policy advocates seldom seek policy changes without collaborating with existing advocacy groups. We have discussed the Children’s Defense Fund ( Insert 8.3 ) and now discuss the mobilization of welfare recipients by George Wiley (see Insert 8.6 ). Policy advocacy groups that help specific vulnerable populations, whether they are based in a single national location (such as Washington, DC), a specific state or locality, or in many states, provide remarkable assistance to policy advocates. They collect data from recent research. They are knowledgeable about existing policies at local, state, and national levels. They are familiar with recent attempts to change existing policies. They have contacts with key public officials. They know LO 8-12 about other advocacy groups whose interests and knowledge overlap with their group. A first task for policy practitioners, then, is to use navigational skills to identify existing advocacy groups that are relevant to a specific issue, such as through Internet searches or other inquiries. Before they begin their work, they find out what is known. They discover, too, whether specific advocacy groups are interested in collaborating with them. Insert 8.6. Proﬁles in Policy Practice and Advocacy: George Alvin W iley (1931–1973) George Alvin Wiley, who is best remembered for creating the first national organization of welfare recipients, was born on February 26, 1931, in Bayonne, New Jersey, one of six children born to William Daniel Wiley and Olive (Thomas) Wiley. He spent most of his childhood in Warwick, Rhode Island, a small town just outside Providence. Wiley, whose family was extremely religious, hardworking, and focused on achievement, was expected to work hard and contribute to the well-being of his family. He demonstrated exceptional abilities in high school, where he scored in the highly gifted range on IQ tests and earned a place in the Rhode Island Honor Society. It was during this time that Wiley became interested in science in general and chemistry in particular. During his senior year in high school, Wiley entered a statewide science fair and won a scholarship to Rhode Island State College, which was renamed Rhode Island University in 1952. In college, Wiley majored in organic chemistry. He maintained a strong academic performance, worked, and participated extensively in extracurricular activities. He was the first African American member of the fraternity to which he belonged. Wiley also became involved in activities that helped develop the leadership skills he would take with him throughout his career. In 1953, Wiley graduated from Rhode Island University and began graduate studies at Cornell University. In 1957, he received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry and was awarded a grant to complete his postdoctoral work at the University of California, Los Angeles. Prior to leaving for California, Wiley served a brief tour of army duty in Virginia. While there, he became interested in civil rights and joined the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In 1960, following the completion of his postdoctoral work and a brief faculty appointment to UCLA’s chemistry department, Wiley left California and moved to Syracuse, New York, where he joined the faculty of the chemistry department at Syracuse University. Shortly thereafter, he met Wretha Frances Whittle, a white graduate student whom he married in June 1961. After the couple had two children, Wiley decided to settle down and devote his remaining years to research work in organic chemistry. But his plans would soon change. Wiley, whose brief experience in Virginia’s civil rights movement stayed forever in his mind, became active in efforts to eliminate racial discrimination in the educational setting. In the early 1960s, he wrote an open letter to Syracuse University’s newspaper to protest the discrimination he knew existed within fraternities and sororities. Wiley was also instrumental in organizing the Syracuse chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE, which he later chaired and led in a series of antidiscrimination demonstrations. CORE’s chief objective was to expose segregation in the public school system and to protest discrimination against people of color in employment. CORE members also attempted a boycott of businesses in hopes of bringing reform to the urban renewal program. Due to the success of his organizing efforts in Syracuse, Wiley was offered the position of associate national director of CORE in November of 1964. Shortly after accepting the offer, Wiley arranged a sabbatical from Syracuse University and moved his family to New York. Once in New York, Wiley found himself in charge of an administrative system in need of strong leadership and severe reorganization. Staff members who were suspicious of Wiley, and his intentions, made his job even more difficult. By 1965, he had managed to solve CORE’s administrative problems and to develop good rapport with the staff members, who later became Wiley’s strongest allies. But by the middle of the year, Wiley was once again faced with problems stemming from within CORE. These problems revolved around the need to reexamine CORE’s commitment to racial integration and nonviolent activism. On one side of the debate, members who supported the black power philosophy argued, successfully, that CORE should abandon its interracial stance, reducing the power and presence of whites, and become an all-African American organization. On the other side, Wiley and his supporters rejected the exclusion of whites, arguing that the minority status of African Americans made participation by whites essential to the success of CORE. Disappointed and disheartened by the national board’s decision to replace outgoing director James Farmer with Floyd McKissack instead of him, in January of 1966 Wiley resigned from CORE. A few months later, he formally resigned from Syracuse University and moved to Washington, DC, where he devoted the remainder of his life to crusading for the poor. After a brief stint as national action coordinator of the Citizens Crusade Against Poverty, Wiley founded the Poverty/Rights Action Center, or P/RAC. On June 30, 1966, P/RAC, which served as a vehicle to organize the welfare poor, led marches on the Ohio state capital to pressure the legislature to increase welfare benefits to the minimum level mandated by the state for health and decency. On that same day, inspired by Wiley’s leadership and commitment to reform, welfare groups organized by P/RAC demonstrated in 25 other cities in a show of solidarity. The success of these crusades led to the creation of the National Welfare Rights Organization, or NWRO, in August 1967. Shortly after its creation, Wiley became the executive director of NWRO and continued his efforts to organize the poor. Under his leadership, the NWRO became an advocate for the poor in court, where it challenged welfare laws. The NWRO also appeared on behalf of the poor before congressional committees, again to promote welfare reform. The NWRO’s efforts were augmented by the volunteered legal services of lawyers who shared the organization’s convictions and supported the welfare reform movement. Many cases were argued and won before the Supreme Court, resulting in the expansion of the rights of those on welfare. By 1970, the NWRO and the welfare rights movement faced intense public opposition. Marches and public demonstrations no longer proved effective tools in the crusade to reform welfare. Internal conflicts led to a great division within the NWRO and eventually destroyed it. On December 31, 1972, after a dispute with the board of directors, Wiley resigned from the organization he was instrumental in creating. After leaving the NWRO, Wiley founded the Movement for Economic Justice, which had as its main objective organizing not only the welfare poor but all of the poor in America. His efforts were cut short by his sudden and tragic death on August 8, 1973. The policy practice of George Wiley asks us to consider involving our clients in policy practice, as illustrated by welfare recipients. In thinking about policy advocacy, an interesting question to consider is this one: can (or should) policy advocates involve their clients or consumers in their work? The National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) was possibly the most successful project that actually mobilized consumers (welfare recipients) to seek and obtain their benefits. The NWRO established a national office as well as local chapters in most of the nation’s major cities. It is interesting to speculate why an organization like NWRO was not established when AFDC was drastically reformed in 1996 and replaced with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). Since TANF imposed a set of harsh policies on recipients, a watchdog organization of recipients might have prevented many abuses in specific cases by working to involve clients or consumers in policy advocacy. Such efforts would fulfill the goal of empowering clients—whether by joining delegations to the administrators of agencies or departments, testifying before legislative committees, writing letters to public officials, visiting public officials, or joining protests. Clients possess considerable legitimacy in the eyes of public officials because they have actually experienced the effects of specific policies, such as a homeless person for whom the lack of affordable housing is not an abstract concept. What W e Can Learn from the Persistence of Unmet Needs and Policy Issues during the Paradoxical Era Many policy advocates hoped that Congress would approve some version of Nixon’s proposed Family Assistance Plan. Some versions that were considered by Congress would have established nationwide benefit standards, provided truly significant child care assistance, and included significant resources for job training. All families whose income was less than a specific level, established nationally, would have been eligible. Because Congress was unable to reach an agreement, the existing AFDC program continued in place for the next 25 years. Even though AFDC rolls did not greatly expand in the 1980s and 1990s (unlike the 1950s and 1960s), the program remained highly controversial, attracting the ire of such notable conservatives, such as President Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich. With the eventual agreement of President Bill Clinton, conservatives drastically changed AFDC when it was converted to TANF in 1996. Not only was it no longer an entitlement—leaving Congress with the ability even to stop funding it—but the legislation also placed many restrictive measures on the states such as lifetime limits on the number of years specific recipients could receive TANF, requirements for teen mothers on TANF to live with their parents, and an insistence that recipients be put into jobs. Welfare rolls roughly halved in the succeeding 11 years—making it seem that “the welfare problem” had disappeared. Considerable evidence suggests, however, that the basic problem—impoverished single (mostly female) heads of households—continues to exist. Although most single mothers are working, many women have not substantially improved their economic status—and often cannot afford quality child care, health care, and transportation costs. The stress of meeting their survival needs makes parenting more difficult since many of them must work multiple jobs even to stay near the poverty threshold. Many women who remained on welfare rolls possess chronic physical and mental problems—or have children with disabilities. What W e Can Learn from Failed Policy Strategies of the Paradoxical Era The “War on Drugs” was born during the administration of Richard Nixon when he launched an ambitious effort to close off the supply of heroin and cocaine by preventing opium and coca from entering the country from nations such as Mexico and Turkey—a campaign continued by Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. By declaring a war on drugs, Nixon hoped to draw Southern conservatives and Northern Catholics into the Republican Party. Battling drug abuse strongly appealed to these groups, particularly as many of them opposed the “drug culture” of the 1960s. From the 1970s onward, the United States has spent tens of billions of dollars on “interdiction” that sought to cut the supply of illegal drugs from other nations, despite limited progress and considerable evidence that robust drug treatment and preventive programs would be more cost-effective. In fact, a war on drugs was launched far earlier in American history. * Use of opium, as well as cocaine, was widespread and legal in American history during the 19th century among all social classes. Not only were these drugs not banned, but they were also imported in large quantities—for example, 24,000 pounds of opium were brought into New England during the 1840s. Wanting to reap revenues on imported drugs, the U.S. Congress levied a tax on opium and morphine in 1890. (Made from opium, heroin was invented in 1895 by the Bayer Company of Germany, which prepared the substance by diluting morphine with acetyls. Cocaine was made from the leaves of the coca shrub.) The United States took its first steps against drugs by banning opium in 1905 and requiring labeling on patent medicines when it enacted the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. In 1914 the United States enacted the Harrison Narcotics Act, which sought to curb cocaine and heroin use by requiring doctors and pharmacists who prescribed narcotics to register and pay a tax. Americans banned the importation of opium except for medical use in 1922—and the U.S. Treasury Department Narcotics Division banned all legal narcotics sales, a policy that forced addicts to buy drugs from illegal street dealers. The Heroin Act of 1925 made the manufacture and possession of heroin illegal. Made from hemp, two other drugs achieved prominence in the United States: marijuana (a weaker version) and hashish (a stronger version). Less addictive than heroin and cocaine but also producing strong neurological effects, marijuana was first used in significant quantities in the United States during the 1920s. Its use, sale, and possession were banned by the United States in 1937, but it nonetheless evolved into a widely used substance by youth in the 1960s when large amounts were smuggled into the United States from Mexico. (In succeeding decades, it reached the United States from many other nations, including Canada—and was illegally grown in many locations in the United States as well.) The criminalization of specific drugs did not stop their importation into the United States. Mafia and other criminal elements imported vast quantities of drugs that were distributed through a robust black market in the 1930s and following World War II. Attempting to block the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, the United States protected drug warlords in return for their support in the 1950s and 1960s. Many military personnel became addicted to heroin in the Vietnam conflict, with as many as 750,000 persons addicted to heroin in the United States by 1970. Cocaine and heroin were imported in large quantities into the United States from Mexico, Colombia, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other nations from 1970 onward. Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, which established four schedules (categories) of drugs. Schedule 1 includes substances with a high potential for abuse and with no currently accepted medical use even when supervised by a physician (schedule 1 includes more than 80 named drugs including marijuana, cocaine, and heroin). Schedule 2 includes substances with a high potential for abuse but with currently accepted medical use (schedule 2 includes methadone, which is used to help alcoholics). Schedules 3 and 4 include substances with less or low potential for abuse and with currently accepted medical use (many prescribed drugs fall into this category). A series of “designer drugs” have emerged in recent decades in the United States, including ecstasy and methamphetamines, which are illicitly manufactured in laboratories in homes and elsewhere—making it very difficult for drug enforcement personnel to find and arrest persons who make them. Some designer drugs have dangerous physiological and mental impacts on persons who use them. As the United States declared war on cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, it was far more tolerant regarding tobacco and alcohol—both of which are potentially addictive drugs that are extremely harmful to many people. (Rescinded by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933, the prohibition of alcohol has not been revived in the United States.) Both substances were protected from regulation by a vast network of growers, distributors, and retail outlets. Both substances are far more widely used than illicit drugs and cause more physical and mental harm to their victims when viewed cumulatively. Like other nations, the United States has had to make difficult policy choices regarding drugs. Which of these potentially addictive substances should be declared illegal and which ones should be legalized? Should some of them, like marijuana, be legalized for narrow medical uses under the supervision of physicians, such as the use of marijuana to diminish pain among terminally ill persons or persons with chronic diseases? (As we discuss in succeeding chapters, some states enacted legislation to legalize use of marijuana during the presidency of Barack Obama.) Should personal possession of small quantities of marijuana be treated as a felony or should a lesser misdemeanor penalty—or no penalty—be imposed? At what levels should the nation fund and provide substance abuse services to the users of these various drugs? What approaches should be used to help persons overcome specific kinds of addictions? To the extent that drugs are criminalized, how can the nation make enforcement equitable so that penalties do not disproportionately fall upon certain kinds of users, such as African Americans and Latinos? As we have already seen, the United States criminalized many drugs and focused its resources on an interdiction and enforcement approach—including penalties for the possession and sale of marijuana. The stakes were extremely high for the nation when fashioning its drug policies. As many as 440,000 persons died each year from the effects of tobacco in 2007. More than 10 million adults and 3 million children and adolescents suffer from alcoholism and its many adverse medical effects, including damage to the brain and other organs. Alcoholics are often not productive workers, disproportionately engage in spousal and child abuse, and often harm themselves and others when they drive while intoxicated. Alcoholic pregnant women often cause their babies to have birth defects— as do pregnant women addicted to cocaine and heroin. Persons addicted to cocaine and heroin often suffer from heart and respiratory problems, strokes, and premature deaths as well as psychological trauma. Although the percentage of 18- to 25-year-old Americans reporting use of cocaine has declined significantly in recent years, large numbers of Americans are addicted to cocaine or heroin. (In 2010, 1.5 million Americans aged 12 and older were reportedly current users of cocaine.) Chronic tobacco smokers suffer from acute respiratory distress, premature heart attacks, strokes, and many kinds of cancer. Americans spend more than $500 billion per year on addictions when health, law enforcement, and prison costs are combined. * Roughly 60,000 Americans died in 2016 from opioid poisoning, i.e.,s from pain killing drugs. Addictions cause yet other serious problems. The majority of roughly 55,000 fatalities per year from automobile accidents in the United States are caused by drivers who are drunk or “high.” Emergency rooms of the nation’s hospitals are overwhelmed by visits from persons who are drunk or high—or who suffer from physical effects of addictions. Illicit drugs also divert huge resources from traditional law enforcement to efforts to locate, arrest, and prosecute the users and sellers. They fill prisons with persons convicted of drug-related offenses—particularly African American and Latino inmates from 18 to 25 years of age. They lead not just to deaths and injuries by users, but to violence among persons and gangs competing to obtain and sell illicit drugs. * Confronted with addictions of this magnitude, Americans have evolved one-sided and inequitable policies. Following President Nixon’s lead, they have devoted far more resources to decreasing the supply of illicit drugs than to reducing the demand . In President George W. Bush’s 2003 budget, for example, about 53% of drug-related expenditures were allocated to enforcement, compared with only 29% for treatment and 18% for prevention. Enforcement has not markedly reduced the amount of drugs in the United States over the past two decades due to the nation’s vast borders and seacoasts. Nor has the United States been successful in convincing the growers of drugs in many developing nations to curtail or end their production. Many low-income farmers in developing nations rely upon income from the sale of drugs to survive. Government officials and criminal elements often do not try to curtail the production of drugs in developing nations, since they also receive resources from their sale or from groups that purchase and export them. It is often difficult to locate and destroy crops of drug-producing plants in jungles and other remote locations. It is not surprising, then, that the price of illicit drugs in the United States has decreased in the past two decades—suggesting that their quantity has increased despite the huge resources spent on enforcement. * While domestic drug enforcement has brought convictions of many large drug dealers, it has led to disproportionate prosecutions and incarceration of persons of color, particularly African Americans and Latinos between the ages of 18 and 25 even though the use of illicit drugs by these populations is not markedly higher than that by Caucasian youth. This inequitable result stems from enforcement strategies of local police and drug enforcement personnel. Persons of color disproportionately use “crack cocaine,” which is sold in small and less expensive batches and is injected—often in “shooting galleries” where persons exchange needles. Congress chose to make criminal penalties for crack cocaine far higher than for its powder form— including 5-year mandatory sentences for 5 grams, which is the same penalty as for 500 grams of the powder form. Crack is distributed by an army of street vendors who are vulnerable to arrest because of their sheer numbers and because they are on the streets. Wanting lots of arrests, police have gone after these suppliers, as well as users who get their injections in relatively public places. * By contrast, drug enforcement officials have had less incentive to find more affluent users in suburban locations. These users get their cocaine from a smaller number of dealers who distribute and sell it in relatively private locations. They use their drugs not on the streets but in their offices, homes, or other locations. They are, moreover, disproportionately Caucasian individuals who can hire private attorneys compared with low-income African American and Latino users who rely on public defenders. Not surprisingly, then, most persons who are arrested for possession of crack are low-income persons of color—who disproportionately end up in prison compared with Caucasian users. Their use of infected needles to receive their drugs has meant, as well, that they are subject to getting HIV/AIDS and hepatitis—dangers less likely for affluent users. Jailed with virtually no social or substance abuse services, job training, or educational services, many of these youth resume their use of drugs soon after leaving prison—only to be reincarcerated. Substantial numbers become homeless. By focusing largely on enforcement activities, the United States has failed sufficiently to curtail demand for illicit drugs—whether by providing substance abuse treatment services or by funding prevention programs. Treatment services have been so underfunded that many people do not receive them at all or wait for months to get them. Yet research strongly indicates that drug treatment services are more cost-effective than enforcement as a way to curtail drug usage, even when many persons must engage in numerous courses of treatment to finally surmount their addiction. * Nor have Americans adequately funded educational and community programs to prevent the use of drugs, such as by helping teenagers surmount peer culture that often pressures them to use illicit drugs. Nor did they sufficiently consider, until decades later, whether to legalize marijuana because it has fewer negative effects than cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. Public officials have shown little inclination to rethink the War on Drugs. It allows Americans to blame foreign nations for their drug problem. It blames the victims rather than defining addiction as a disease that should be treated. It allows local politicians to claim credit for numerous arrests. It provides large numbers of persons for the nation’s prison industry. It allows Americans to assume that addicts are primarily persons of color when, in fact, substance abuse devastates the lives of persons in all ethnic groups and social classes. The United States could have considered rrescinding the term “War on Drugs” and replacing it with a public health approach to addictions that provides treatment and prevention to at-risk populations wherever they reside. What W e Can Learn from Promising Strategies of the Paradoxical Era The major accomplishment in the 1970s was the establishment of an array of entitlements that included Supplementary Security Income, the Earned Income Tax Credit, a greatly expanded Food Stamp Program, and Social Security retirement benefits indexed to inflation. These entitlements markedly reduced rates of poverty in the United States in the 1970s— channeling billions of dollars of benefits to residents over extended periods. Entitlements reduce stigma because persons are entitled to their benefits. They are more difficult for legislators to cut in the budget process because they are automatically funded to the level of claimed benefits in any given year. What We Can Learn from the Paradoxical Era about the Structure of the American W elfare State With the addition of these entitlements and the continuation of many of the programs established during the Johnson administration, Americans had evolved a relatively sophisticated welfare state even if it had many gaps in it. Federal social spending increased from $158 billion to $314 billion in only 10 years (in 1980 dollars). The greatest additions occurred in the entitlement programs that still remain a critical part of the American welfare state. The American welfare state consisted by 1980, then, of a series of overlays, as well as linked programs. At the lowest level, the social welfare programs that had traditionally been operated by local governments existed, including public schools, general assistance welfare programs, child welfare programs, some prisons and correctional facilities, and police departments. Even these programs were often linked to state-level funding and policies, such as when states contributed to some or all of them. In turn, state-level social welfare programs existed, particularly in those states with strongly developed state roles in funding, overseeing, and establishing policies for educational and child welfare programs. Many states had relatively strong mental health responsibilities not only in funding and running state mental hospitals, but in funding and overseeing local mental health clinics. All states, moreover, ran programs linked to federal funding and oversight in welfare, Medicaid, the Section 8 public housing program, child welfare, and mental health areas were linked to federal–state programs during the New Deal and the Great Society eras. Added to these programs were strictly federal programs wherein the federal government took major responsibility for funding and administering the former Food Stamp Program, SSI, Medicare, and the EITC. As the legacy of the Great Society, moreover, federal agencies gave grants to local programs in public health, child welfare, mental health, and other areas. By engaging in micro, mezzo, and macro policy advocacy, social workers need to understand these overlays and linked programs in their particular states. In some states, such as California, counties assumed major roles in administering child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health services, whereas in states such as New York stronger state-level administration and oversight of these programs existed. Chafing at the sheer numbers of programs in local areas directly funded by federal agencies, President Nixon, as well as many conservatives, created many so-called “block grants” through which the federal government would give money to the states in such broad areas as mental health and let them use the funds (more or less) as they wished. They preferred this option to the extensive federal power that existed when the federal government designated precisely how its federal money would be used in so-called categorical programs such as Head Start and scores of other programs that gave states little leeway in designing the programs that they wanted. It would be the legacy of the administration of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s to greatly increase the power and role of states in social welfare in a movement known as “devolution,” which I discuss in the next chapter .

Social Policy in a Period of Conservative Backlash Introduction Many conservatives did not like the creation and expansion of the American welfare state from 1933 through the mid 1970s. They could not block its expansion, however, because the Democratic Party controlled both Chambers of Congress for most of this period, as well as many presidencies. They were frustrated, too, by the considerable number of moderate Republicans who often joined forces with Democrats to support civil rights, social programs, federal aid to education, and many other measures during the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. Everything changed with the landslide victory of Ronald Reagan in 1980. Reagan dealt serious blows to the American welfare state. He obtained federal budgets that cut the spending of social programs—and that indirectly depleted resources from them through large tax cuts and large military expenditures. Yet he orchestrated an historic immigration bill through Congress and mostly supported such entitlements as Social Security, Medicare, and the Earned Income Tax Credit.

Bush 1990 Enactment of Americans with Disabilities Act and the Child Care and Introduction Domestic federal spending had risen rapidly during the 1970s, largely due to entitlements. Even domestic discretionary spending had risen somewhat. If conservative themes had existed during the paradoxical decade of the 1970s, they had contended with liberal policy changes in federal spending and civil rights. Almost overnight, however, conservatives achieved supremacy as a former actor, Ronald Reagan, achieved a landslide victory in 1980 as well as Republican control of the U.S. Senate. At the end of this chapter, we discuss what we can learn in contemporary society from the era of presidents Reagan and G. H. W. Bush about policy advocacy, social policy, and the structure of the American welfare state. Development Block Grant program 1992 Los Angeles uprising in the wake of Rodney King verdictEvaluate the Ascendancy of Conservatism EP 3b Conservatism was the political mainstream of the nation in the Gilded Age, the 1920s, and the 1950s, when localism, limited federal social welfare roles, and unfettered capitalism prevailed, but it gave way to liberal policies during the Great Depression, much of the 1960s, and the early 1970s. * The minority status of conservatives was illustrated by the landslide defeat in 1964 of Barry Goldwater by Lyndon Johnson, who accused Goldwater of attacking Social Security, TVA, and other legacies of the New Deal. When the Goldwater defeat was swiftly followed by Johnson’s legislative successes in 1965 and 1966, it seemed as if conservatism had run its course in national politics. Between 1966 and 1980, however, a number of developments led to a remarkable resurgence of conservatism that culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan. The standard of living of the American working and middle classes had improved markedly during the 1950s and 1960s, despite occasional recessions and sharp inflation in the early 1950s. Most people believed that government officials, armed with Keynesian economic theory, could continue this rosy scenario by adjusting government spending downward (to reduce inflation) or upward (to reduce unemployment). The American economy was widely perceived to be an expanding pie that would benefit all segments of the population. * The simultaneous appearance of inflation and unemployment—so called “stagflation”—in the 1970s rudely upset this economic utopia. Many LO 9-1 middle-class Americans found their earnings sharply eroded by inflation, which not only increased the cost of living but also pushed them into higher federal tax brackets. * Many local taxes were also rising to cover the higher costs of local and municipal services and to pay the local costs of federally mandated programs. Howard Jarvis campaigned successfully in 1978 in California for Proposition 13, which drastically reduced local property taxes. This victory was followed by grassroots tax revolts in many other states. Liberal legislators watched these local tax revolts with trepidation, for they realized that they could eventually stimulate protests against the federal tax system and the social programs it funded. * Social reform in the 1970s was also undermined by concern about federal deficits, which, according to conservatives, could be reduced only by sharp cuts in social spending. * Conservatives’ hopes were buoyed by the declining strength of the Democratic Party. Richard Nixon carried five Southern states in 1968, a Republican achievement that had not been matched since Reconstruction. The liberal flank of the Democratic Party began to weaken as blue-collar workers became increasingly uneasy about social reform and preoccupied with their own economic problems. White backlash led to widespread opposition to affirmative action and social programs, which were widely perceived to disproportionately benefit women, African Americans, and other people of color. Many Jewish voters opposed the use of quotas because this policy had often been used to exclude them from admission to colleges and the professions. * Feminists and African American activists were increasingly viewed with suspicion in a nation that resisted affirmative action. Conservatives spoke of “big-spending liberals” as an anachronism in a society that experienced large deficits. * Trade unions, which had provided electoral and campaign support for the Democrats, were weakened as the economy shifted from manufacturing to service industries, as new jobs were increasingly located in the nonunionized South, and as many industries moved to foreign nations to reduce their labor costs. The ill-fated presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, as well as the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy, also weakened the Democratic Party. Americans had lived through a long period of social reform that had lasted from the early 1930s through the 1970s. Conservatives found the public to be more receptive to their arguments that social programs had not solved poverty and other social problems and that social spending was incompatible with economic growth. The exodus of persons and jobs to the Sun Belt throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, in which nearly 40 million Americans left the Northeast and the Midwest for the South, depleted traditional Democratic bastions and greatly increased the electoral strength of conservatives. When placed in this new environment—and removed from trade unions, big-city mayors, and incumbent liberal politicians—these voters, who tended to be relatively conservative and middle class, often became even more conservative. Throughout the country, moreover, there was a continuing shift of the population to the suburbs. Suburban voters were far more conservative than urban voters because they had little stake in social programs for urban residents. * The traditional strength of the Democratic Party was also undermined by the maturing of the large war-baby generation, born from 1946 to the late 1950s. These Americans had not lived through the Great Depression and, if they were Caucasian and lived in the suburbs, had grown up having little or no contact with people of color. They were often preoccupied with material wealth and with personal survival in labor markets crowded with young job seekers from their generation. * A large group of evangelical voters, who had often abstained from politics, increasingly entered the political arena to seek public policies that would ban abortions, curtail pornography, and oppose civil rights for gay Americans. Together, these various demographic and social trends placed the Democratic Party in jeopardy, particularly as Republicans developed marketing and campaign tactics to reach Sun Belt, suburban, service- oriented, and youthful citizens. There was no sudden erosion in the strength of the Democratic Party, particularly in local elections, but its power in senatorial and presidential elections had diminished significantly by the early 1980s. The Republican Party skillfully wrested two groups of voters from the Democrats: Northern white Catholic voters and working-class and Southern white lower-middle-class voters. Knowing that many of these voters believed that the Great Society had disproportionately assisted people of color and that their rising taxes were caused by this expansion of the welfare state, Republican strategists sought, often successfully, to associate the Democrats with welfare programs, urban riots, high taxes, busing, and affirmative action. They labeled the Republican Party as a party of “law- abiding” citizens who would restore its traditional values. Using advanced marketing techniques, they mailed literature to these two groups of voters and succeeded in persuading many of them to vote for Republican candidates in presidential races. When added to their traditional suburban and relatively affluent constituency, these new voters gave the Republicans a decided advantage, particularly in the presidential elections of 1968, 1972, 1980, 1984, and 1988 (see Insert 9.1 ). * Insert 9.1.

The Legitimization of Conservatism Liberal reformers had dominated political dialogue from the New Deal through the presidency of Lyndon Johnson. * During the 1950s and early 1960s, a cadre of conservative thinkers, such as sociologist Robert Nisbet, promulgated theories about the merits of limiting the federal government’s policy roles and about the need to establish the family, neighborhoods, and local government as buffers between citizens and central government. Other theorists, such as Richard Weaver, established Libertarian positions that would increase citizens’ freedom by abolishing most government regulations and reducing taxes. If conservative theorists of the 1950s were relatively isolated from the political process, these ones urged conservatives to engage in the political process—even calling it a moral duty. * The landslide defeat of Goldwater in 1964 made conservatives realize that they would not gain power without using aggressive advertising and outreach to convince the American public to elect conservative legislators. * Nixon and his allies used the term silent majority in 1968 to describe their belief that most Americans favored localism, elimination of government regulations, and reductions in social spending. In a departure from the abstract conservative philosophy of the 1950s, a number of theorists began to analyze public policy and to offer recommendations that stemmed from their conservative ideology. Milton Friedman, the conservative economist from the University of Chicago who published Capitalism and Freedom in 1962, discussed a series of policies to radically reduce the regulatory power of government; he denounced public housing programs, licensing of professionals, traditional welfare programs, and a host of other liberal policies. * In 1964, Martin Anderson advanced a critique of existing urban renewal programs in The Federal Bulldozer , where he argued that private housing markets more effectively met consumer needs than government urban renewal and housing programs. * By the end of the 1960s, conservatives had established think tanks, including the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation, to compete with such liberal organizations as the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. William Buckley initiated a national television show, Firing Line , which he used as a forum to present conservative views, and developed The National Review , a conservative journal that supplemented viewpoints in The Public Interest, Commentary , and other conservative publications. Kevin Phillips developed theories about how conservatives could wrest political power from the Democrats by appealing to blue-collar, white ethnic, and Sun Belt voters. Presidents Nixon and Ford placed conservative economists such as Alan Greenspan and William Simon in top positions. The respectability of conservative points of view was further enhanced by criticisms of the Democratic Party and Great Society reforms by prominent intellectuals, such as Nathan Glazer and Daniel Moynihan, who pointedly attacked social programs, community action programs, affirmative action, and liberalism. * The constituency of conservatism expanded considerably in the late 1970s, when it obtained a large grassroots following within fundamentalist religious groups, particularly the Southern Baptist Church. White parents, who had sent their children to segregated private schools to escape integrated public schools as well as curriculum they believed to represent secular humanism, were outraged that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not grant tax exemptions to those schools, and they turned to the Republicans, who promised to help rescind the IRS ruling. * The New Religious-Political Right (NRPR) was formed as an umbrella group that contained many independent congregations, individual members, and groups like the Moral Majority. By 1980, it contained 90 constituent organizations—from the national Pro-Life Political Action Committee to the Interfaith Committee Against Blasphemy. * Jerry Falwell, an outspoken Baptist preacher, quickly became the leader of the Moral Majority, a grassroots pressure group that favored the abolition of abortion, censorship of literature to limit pornography, and policies to allow prayer in schools. The Moral Majority lent its support to many political conservatives who advocated sharp reductions in social spending. The various member groups of the NRPR engaged in educational programs, funded by tax-deductible contributions, in which millions of items of literature were distributed through the mail, at churches, and by personal contacts. Some groups also engaged in extensive political activities, including lobbying and contributions to political campaigns. * Ronald Reagan as Catalyst By the late 1970s, the political climate was ripe for the emergence of a conservative movement, and it found a catalyst in Ronald Reagan, a former movie actor turned politician. Reagan came from a family in Illinois that had suffered some poverty and turmoil because Reagan’s father was an alcoholic; it seems likely that Reagan’s dislike of welfare recipients and poor people stemmed in part from the trauma his family encountered as it sought to remain independent despite his father’s erratic behavior. * Reagan was a devoted follower of Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s. During his postwar acting career, however, he became convinced that government regulations had unfairly forced a movie company with which he was associated to divest its holdings in a chain of theaters. He increasingly resented the high taxes that he had to pay as his income from movies increased. His distrust of communists increased as he observed the power of radicals in his union, the Screen Actors Guild. During the late 1940s, he devoted himself to his movie career, choosing roles that mirrored his personal philosophy—for example, Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, a self-made man who preached the virtues of hard work and morality. Reagan remained a Democrat until 1962, but he had gradually moved to the right during the 1950s, when he developed a national reputation as a public speaker for conservative audiences. * Reagan idealized self-made men who achieved upward mobility through the traditional virtues of hard work, persistence, and risk taking. He realized that some Americans encountered hard times, but he was convinced that private philanthropy and the assistance of family and friends were usually sufficient remedies. Since he discounted the importance of racism and discrimination, he believed that, if they tried, African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans could emulate the successes of white citizens. * The economy worked best, he believed, when government assumed virtually no role in its regulation and did not tax citizens beyond the minimal amount needed to fund defense spending and keep a police force. He regarded the 19th century as America’s golden era, when individualism, localism, risk taking, and free enterprise dominated the nation (see Insert 9.2 ). Insert 9.2. Critical Analysis: Reagan’ s Romantic View of the 19th Century Drawing on materials from Chapter 4 of this book, critique Reagan’s romantic view of the 19th century, particularly his belief that the nation benefited from the federal government’s lack of involvement in social policy. In light of our knowledge of social problems in the 19th century, why would Reagan believe that it was the golden age of American history? Reagan’s political hero was Calvin Coolidge, who articulated a conservative philosophy and made deep and successive cuts in federal taxes during the 1920s. * Although Reagan admired Franklin Roosevelt’s political skills and decisive leadership, he held Roosevelt responsible for the introduction of alien and destructive policies, including the development of the federal bureaucracy, federal regulations, handouts or doles to millions of Americans, and heavy federal taxes. In Reagan’s view, Roosevelt had systematically destroyed the vision of the founding fathers and developed massive welfare and public works programs to gain a political constituency for the Democratic Party. Reagan was critical of liberal rulings of the Supreme Court in the 1950s and 1960s under Chief Justice Earl Warren; he believed that liberal justices had erred in limiting the powers of the police excessively. Reagan did not support federal civil rights legislation in the 1960s because he believed that states could protect the civil rights of their citizens. * His political philosophy can be criticized on many counts. The nostalgic view of American history that eulogized generations of self-made men overlooked the systematic oppression of people of color and women in the 19th century and beyond. As his “frontier philosophy” accorded women primarily domestic functions, he did not appoint many women to policy positions during his terms as governor of California and as president. * He did not fully realize that many persons who led salutary lives often also encountered hard times. He overstated the size of Roosevelt’s New Deal, which provided only a minimal set of subsistence supports for unemployed people in the Great Depression. He did not favor social welfare programs to aid poor persons because he regarded economic inequality as an incentive for the poor to improve their economic conditions. * Other troubling characteristics of Reagan appeared even when he was governor, only to resurface during his presidency. Lou Cannon, a reporter who followed him over decades and interviewed him more than 40 times, believes that Reagan’s childhood experiences with an alcoholic father led him to live largely in a fantasy world of movies, Western heroes, and war heroes that made him inattentive to details and unable to grasp the consequences of some of his decisions—for example, his fiscal policies, which led to huge deficits. * He was obsessed with the three themes of lowering taxes, increasing America’s defenses, and cutting social spending to the neglect of social policies that help impoverished people. * He had opposed the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965 along with George H. W. Bush. Analyze Reagan’ s Emergence as a National Hero Those who shared Reagan’s ideology were widely viewed as extremist in the 1960s, even by many Republicans; but Reagan began to shed the label of extremism by winning the 1966 and 1970 elections as governor of California, a state where liberals, trade unions, and people of color have considerable political power. Although his policies were decidedly conservative, Reagan often displayed political pragmatism. While criticizing intellectuals, he substantially increased the budget of the state university, as well as state assistance to public schools; while criticizing social spending, he permitted significant increases in the state’s budget; while criticizing taxes, he increased the state’s taxes by $1 billion; and while criticizing sexual permissiveness and abortion, he supported policies that allowed state funding of abortions. Even as governor, however, Reagan’s pragmatic accommodations were accompanied by harsh and uncompromising attitudes toward people in poverty; for example, he slashed the budgets of selected public welfare, mental health, and child welfare programs. He was indifferent to civil rights as governor. Reagan also initiated a punitive workfare program that forced some recipients into low-paying and menial jobs. He appointed conservative “law and order” justices and continued the rhetoric that extolled conservative values. * He exhibited a penchant for fiscal irresponsibility as governor by making such large tax cuts that he later had to increase taxes to reduce the budget deficit. * Conservatives persuaded Reagan to run against Gerald Ford for the Republican nomination for the presidency in 1976, but his poor showing in the primaries suggested that he was still regarded as a political maverick. Unhappy with the politically moderate Ford, conservatives tried to persuade LO 9-2 Reagan to start a new conservative party both during and after the 1976 race, but he refused because he realized that it would ruin his chances to enter the mainstream of the Republican Party. * He decided to pursue the presidency in 1980 in the aftermath of his defeat for the nomination in 1976, but, like Nixon before him, he realized that Republicans’ traditional negative policies would not suffice to attract a broad range of voters. Review Supply-Side Economics: A Positive Way to Be Negative It was during this period of drift that Reagan and his aides chanced on a theory known as supply-side economics , which became a major theme of his candidacy. * Keynesian economics, which had dominated economic thinking in the United States since the late 1930s, emphasized the use of government spending and changes in interest rates to offset recessions and inflation. In recessions, spending was increased and interest rates were decreased; to combat inflation, these policies were reversed. Even Republican Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, and Ford had used its tenets to guide their economic policies. But Keynesian economics was increasingly under attack by the mid-1970s because it seemed inadequate to solve stagflation. Milton Friedman added new doubts when he suggested that monetary policy—increases or decreases in the supply of money—could powerfully influence the economy. When the government increased the money supply too rapidly, he argued, the nation experienced rapid growth with ensuing inflation, whereas severe reductions in the supply of money often caused recessions. In this welter of economic theories, economist Arthur Laffer, whose ideas were popularized by journalist Jude Wanniski, argued that Keynesian economists had neglected the importance of the supply of capital to economic growth because of their preoccupation with consumer demand, interest rates, and government spending. Laffer reasoned that economic growth requires steady increases in investment, but investment can occur only if wealthy persons and corporations accumulate sufficient amounts of capital to invest in job-creating businesses. However, affluent persons are unlikely to invest their excess money in such businesses, Laffer argued, if their money is subject to high marginal rates of taxation that reduce their profits from investments; in such circumstances, he contended, affluent LO 9-3 persons buy expensive cars, antiques, and other luxuries rather than placing their funds in income-producing investments. No amount of consumer demand, Laffer concluded, can cause economic growth if a shortage of investment capital exists. * Some Republican politicians, including Congressman Jack Kemp, accepted the logic of supply-side economics and vigorously promoted tax reduction. Quite apart from its technical merits, supply-side theory appealed to Reagan and his advisors on political grounds because it purported to offer a solution to stagflation by simultaneously addressing problems of inflation and unemployment. * Increases in pools of investment capital would, they argued, increase employment by creating jobs, whereas inflation would decrease as entrepreneurs invested in technology and new machinery that made workers more productive. Supply-side economics also provided a justification for major reductions in taxes, which are usually popular with conservatives and with many voters. But would not tax cuts exacerbate the nation’s mounting deficits, which had approached $50 billion by the mid- 1970s? Not so, countered the supply-siders because increases in investments prompted by the lower tax rates would stimulate economic activity and hence produce an overall gain in government revenues, even with reductions in tax rates. * Supply-side economics also provided a convenient way to appeal not only to the traditional Republican constituency but also to white blue-collar voters. Supply-side theorists were most interested in tax reductions for affluent persons, but it was relatively easy to also introduce some reductions for blue-collar and middle-class persons by proposing reductions in the appropriate federal tax brackets. * In short, Reagan hoped to achieve Nixon’s dream of enlarging the base of the Republican Party, not by the development of social programs but by economic policy. * Ronald Reagan was not alone in his advocacy of supply-side economics. By 1978, the concepts had obtained sufficient appeal that tax cut proposals nearly passed both houses of Congress with bipartisan support. * However, in 1980, Reagan was the only presidential contender in either party who strongly supported the theory; indeed, in the Republican primaries, G. H. W. Bush attacked Reagan’s policies as “voodoo economics.” * Supply-side economics, then, provided a positive way to be negative. Reagan could demand tax cuts (a negative policy) to promote economic growth, reductions in both unemployment and inflation, reductions of the federal deficit, and increases in the income of Americans of all social classes (positive policies). Since supply-side economists were convinced that economic growth would follow tax cuts, they did not believe that major cuts in government spending were required to curtail deficits. Reagan coupled supply-side economics, however, with his traditional demands that social spending be radically reduced and that many government regulations be rescinded. Reagan’s demands for reductions in the role of the federal government might have been dismissed earlier in the decade as Republican negativism, but they struck a sympathetic chord in the political climate of the late 1970s, when Americans were distrustful of federal bureaucrats and Congress. * Moreover, many white Americans were convinced their taxes rose during the 1970s because of increases in spending for social programs that they believed were used primarily by people of color. Discuss the Campaign of 1980 Reagan won the nomination of the Republican Party in 1980, but Carter, the Democratic incumbent, enjoyed a substantial lead in polls in early September, scored heavily when he attacked Reagan as trigger-happy, and used his presidential access to the media to advantage. * The political climate of 1980 was very different from that of 1964, however, and Reagan was far more politically adept than Goldwater. His political success stemmed from his ability to adapt his political message to the mood of voters in 1980, with considerable aid from media and political consultants. Carter’s response to the nation’s economic ills was to cut social spending, but Reagan coupled this response with his supply-side vision of sweeping tax cuts. Carter projected an image of policy vacillation, but Reagan consistently presented his conservative philosophy and advocacy of rearmament. Reagan’s rugged image appealed to those male voters who regarded Carter as soft. (Carter was more appealing to female voters, but not enough to offset Reagan’s lead with male voters.) Carter’s campaign promises to specific interest groups, such as the National Education Association, made him seem beholden to them, but Reagan claimed to be speaking for the entire nation. Carter emphasized the difficulties in righting the economy, but Reagan exuded an optimism reminiscent of Roosevelt’s in 1932. (See Figure 9.1 ) LO 9-4 Figure 9.1. Details Daniel SIMON/Getty Images Presidential campaign of Ronald Reagan in Illinois on October 18, 1980. Reagan was aided by public opinion that strongly favored conservatism. After the trauma of Vietnam, Watergate, stagflation, and the Iran hostage crisis, many Americans wanted a respite with a president who could make the world seem simple, who could unite the nation behind patriotism and national pride, and who seemed to stand for moral values. Reagan appealed to many white Americans’ distress at the pace of reform in the preceding two decades and their opposition to affirmative action, quotas, and busing. He made extraordinary promises that appealed to those Americans who sought easy answers to stagflation; he even predicted that he could cut taxes, increase defense spending, and balance the budget! * He played on the racial and social fears of white voters by stressing opposition to busing, affirmative action, quotas, and welfare; indeed, he loved to recount the story of a “welfare queen” who had enriched herself through welfare fraud—a story later found to be false. * In the 1980 presidential election, Reagan won a landslide victory; he obtained a large majority of the male vote, carried the entire Southern and Western regions of the nation, and wrested large numbers of blue-collar votes from the Democratic Party. * Assess the Reagan Policy Blitzkrieg In the conservative equivalent of Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office, Reagan during his first 8 months secured major budget cuts, tax cuts, the elimination of many regulations, reductions in the federal government’s policy roles, and massive increases in military spending. A number of conditions allowed Reagan to move quickly and successfully on his conservative agenda. First, the Democrats were thoroughly demoralized by the size of Reagan’s victory in 1980. They feared that it might presage a permanent shift of blue-collar and white ethnic populations to the Republican Party. * Thus intimidated by Reagan, the Democrats were also in disarray as they planned their political strategy. Some wanted their party to militantly oppose Reagan’s policies and to reassert liberal principles; others feared that opposition would allow Reagan to accuse them of resisting the will of the people; still other Democrats hoped to obtain partial credit for conservative policies by offering budget and tax alternatives to Reagan’s positions. * Democrats also encountered serious practical and leadership problems. Having obtained numerical superiority in the Senate in 1980, Republicans possessed a crucial bastion in the Congress as long as they remained united. In the House, the Democratic Party maintained only a slim majority of 38 seats, which could be overcome if there were defections to the Republicans from conservative Southern Democrats, whose constituencies often favored Reagan’s policies. The Democrats lacked effective leadership to develop their policy strategy because Tip O’Neill, the majority leader in the House, was widely perceived to lack skills in initiating policies and had awarded crucial committee and party positions to conservative Democrats following an internal party struggle in 1980. * Reagan and his aides plotted a brilliant strategy to capitalize on the Democrats’ weakness and the desperate economic situation. Their tactics LO 9-5 included militance, centralization, surprise, preparedness, co-optation of conservative Southern Democrats, and preemption of federal revenues through tax cuts and increases in military spending. Let’s see how these tactics played out in practice. The term militance is usually applied to the strategy of radicals, but it usefully describes the risk-taking orientation of Reagan and his top advisors, who wanted drastic reductions in social programs and regulations. * Reagan knew that he could not instantly eradicate most of the welfare state because of political support for many social programs, but he hoped to reduce government spending from 23% to 19% of the gross national product (GNP) by 1984 and to hold government spending increases to 7% per year, which was far below the 16% increases in the last years of the Carter administration. Cuts in social spending were particularly needed because of projected massive increases in military spending, which Reagan wanted to increase by 160% over the defense budget during the next 6 years —rising from $142 billion in 1980 to $368 billion by 1986. Reagan’s inner circle of advisors quickly decided that they could be successful only if they created a climate in which virtually every program and government unit was asked to sacrifice for the common good and opposition to cuts in particular programs was viewed as sabotaging efforts to reduce deficits and restore economic growth. * They intimidated recalcitrant members of Congress with the prospect of opposition from Reagan in upcoming elections, particularly in those districts in the South and West where Reagan had run more strongly than incumbents. They even hoped to persuade some Southern Democrats to become Republicans in return for choice committee assignments and other political concessions. * Although Reagan was committed to budget cuts, he was equally interested in tax cuts, both to spark economic growth and to reduce federal revenues that might otherwise be used to fund social programs. * In a sense, then, Reagan was using the tax cuts to force budget cuts. He calculated that, because tax cuts were politically popular, members of Congress would be pressured to enact them—and that the resulting decreases in revenues would force spending cuts unless Congress wanted to take the blame for budget deficits. * Indeed, as David Stockman, the budget director, revealed to Senator Daniel Moynihan in 1985, Reagan had acknowledged in 1981 that he wanted a huge deficit to force Congress to cut costly social spending. * Many Democrats were acutely aware of Reagan’s strategy, but they encountered a political predicament. In the conservative political atmosphere of 1980, it would have been difficult to oppose both tax and budget cuts. Accordingly, many liberal Democrats decided to support budget cuts and oppose tax cuts. They regarded tax cuts as particularly pernicious, as they diminished revenues that were needed to fund social programs. * Democrats reasoned, then, that consenting to large budget cuts would make it clear that they were not obstructionists, and so they would then be free to oppose the tax cuts. Their strategy backfired, however, because they did not realize that the tax cuts were so popular with their colleagues and with the electorate that Congress would enact them in addition to massive budget cuts. Military spending, although it had increased in absolute terms during most of the 1970s, had decreased from 49% of the federal budget in 1960 to 21% in 1980 as the size of the budget grew because of increased spending on entitlements. President Carter had initiated increases in military spending. However, Reagan sought increases that were unprecedented during peacetime. Indeed, his advisors wanted to expend $1.46 trillion on defense in the next 5 years—a sum so large that even the hawkish David Stockman believed it would make a massive federal deficit inevitable. * These incredible increases in defense spending, like the proposed tax cuts, were highly popular with an American public convinced that the United States needed to deal with the Soviet Union from a position of strength, though a number of legislators questioned its sheer size. Realizing that Reagan would obtain major increases in defense spending, members of Congress recognized that cuts in social programs would be needed to restrain budget deficits. The issue of guns versus butter surfaced once again; this time, many Americans believed that guns should take precedence. Like the tax cuts, the increase in defense spending was a threat to social spending because it diminished resources that could be invested in social programs. Reagan soon realized, however, that his budget cuts would be endangered if he attacked social programs with powerful constituencies, such as Social Security, Medicare, Head Start, SSI, disability payments for veterans, summer jobs programs, and school lunch programs. In addition to declaring these programs immune from cuts, Reagan cleverly argued that he was not cutting aggregate social spending in absolute terms but was merely cutting the rate of increase in social spending. He also announced that he would preserve a safety net of basic programs for Americans who were poor or ill, so that none of them would lose welfare protections. * These arguments, he hoped, would make him appear compassionate, even as he proposed massive cuts in many social programs. Reagan’s decision to focus on cutbacks in means-tested programs rather than so-called entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security had profound—and disastrous—consequences for many Americans. Entitlements constituted 41% of the nation’s spending in 1980; indeed, Social Security alone constituted almost 33% of the nation’s domestic budget. To achieve his target of $50 billion in cuts, therefore, Reagan had to slash programs that specifically gave services and resources to poor persons. * Certainly, his argument that he was only slowing the rate of increase of aggregate social spending was technically correct; nevertheless, many specific programs that assisted poor persons were eliminated or severely slashed. For example, Reagan proposed decreasing the federal share of AFDC, even though the real value of AFDC benefits had eroded during the late 1970s. He called for massive cuts in food stamps and Medicaid, as well as in nutritional, mental health, and public health programs. * Anticipating efforts by lobbyists and defenders of specific programs to mobilize opposition to his cuts, Reagan called on David Stockman and Edwin Meese to develop and implement a centralized strategy to push them through. * The youthful Stockman, formerly a conservative member of the House, had gained detailed knowledge of government programs and finance when he fashioned Republican alternatives to Carter’s budgets in the late 1970s. Impressed by Stockman’s knowledge, Reagan appointed him director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the agency that develops the president’s budget. Meese, a conservative attorney who had been Reagan’s attorney general in California, was given the authority to manage domestic policy decisions within the White House and to control the flow of paper to Reagan. He was joined by James Baker and Michael Deaver, respectively, a clever negotiator who orchestrated policy compromises with Congress and an expert in public relations. Reagan and his advisors realized that their objective of securing cuts in social programs could not be accomplished if they gave the opposition time to organize, if they allowed recently appointed cabinet officials to advocate increased funds for their departments, or if they gave opponents of specific cuts the opportunity to join forces with opponents of other cuts. Stockman, Meese, and Baker quickly held a series of briefings with recently appointed cabinet officials, where they announced plans for major cuts in their departments’ programs and urged them to be team players. Richard Schweiker, the newly appointed secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, conceded to most of the proposed cuts in social programs, not only because of the pressure that was placed on him but also because he had converted to conservatism after a relatively liberal voting record as a senator. * Stockman also met with many members of Congress to inform them of proposed cuts and seek their ideas for further cuts. He compiled in a large black book the growing list of proposed cuts, which quickly totaled $50 billion, a staggering and unprecedented sum. No one was allowed access to this book, which was stored in a safe in Stockman’s office, but the repeated leaks of proposed cuts kept the opposition off guard and strengthened the impression that everyone would have to sacrifice. Reagan’s team created a siege atmosphere, in which it seemed unpatriotic to oppose cuts in specific programs. * The Democrats threatened to defeat Reagan’s policies in the House, where they held a majority, but Reagan remedied this situation by cultivating the support of conservative Southern Democrats who favored his tax, military, and budget-cutting policies. These renegade Southern Democrats, who were called “boll weevils,” repeatedly gave Reagan a majority of votes in the House. To gain their support, Reagan’s team consulted with them and gave some of them, such as Phil Gramm of Texas, important roles as sponsors and designers of legislation. The boll weevils’ threat of defection put House Democrats under even more pressure to capitulate to Reagan’s policies, in the knowledge that they could be outvoted by the Reagan coalition of Republicans and boll weevils. * Analyze the T riumph of Conservatism EP 3a Reagan’s strategy led to three major victories for conservatives in 1981: Budget cuts were achieved through passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) in July, tax cuts were enacted in August, and increases in defense spending were made final in the fall. It is difficult under ordinary conditions for a president to control the budgetary process because numerous congressional committees can override his budgetary suggestions. Without describing the complex budgetary maneuvering in detail, suffice it to say that David Stockman became the orchestrator of administration policy. To obtain enactment of OBRA, tax cuts, and increases in defense spending, he literally camped out in Congress, arranged coalitions of Republicans and boll weevils, outmaneuvered liberal Democrats, and made extensive use of Reagan’s popularity and the mass media. OBRA made deep cuts in social programs and eliminated 57 social programs by folding them into seven block grants: social services; community services; alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health services; maternal and child health services; community development services; primary health services; and preventive health services. * By creating block grants and allocating limited funds to each of them, Reagan was able to cut social spending for those programs within the block grants. See Insert 9.3 for critical questions about the extent to which the United States should resort to block grants. LO 9-6 Insert 9.3. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: Should W e Block-Grant All Federal Programs? The concept of returning federal funds to the states has deep roots in American history. For example, President Andrew Jackson proposed such transfers when he ran a budget surplus. More recently, the liberal economist Walter Heller was a prime advocate of revenue sharing in the 1960s. The federal government could transfer all of its tax revenues, save those used for military and international programs, to the states and localities. Were this to happen, what would be the consequences? As two examples, discuss the advisability of block-granting food stamps, SSI, and Medicaid. Remember that, once programs are block-granted they are no longer entitlements so Congress no longer has to fund them to the level of claimed benefits each year. Moreover, relatively conservative states can impose particularly harsh eligibility and benefit policies. (We will ask in Chapter 10 whether shifting AFDC to a block grant program known as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families or TANF was ethically meritorious.) What kinds of programs could states and localities implement with little or no guidance from federal authorities—and which ones should federal authorities retain? Can states—which lack the huge revenues that derive from the federal income tax—fund expensive programs like Medicaid (which Republicans wanted to block-grant in the 1990s) and public education with no federal assistance? Did the states have difficulty funding these programs during the Great Recession of 2007 through 2009? Can you identify some programs in your state that were defunded during the Great Recession with adverse consequences? Reagan achieved another victory in August, when the largest tax cut since the end of World War II was enacted. It made substantial reductions in the taxes of individuals and even larger cuts in the taxes of many corporations. This legislation markedly increased economic inequality by granting larger tax cuts to affluent persons than to middle- and working-class Americans, at the same time that social programs for the poor were being decimated. In the end, the tax cuts gained the support not only of boll weevils and Republicans but also of many Democrats who had initially planned to contest them but who feared retaliation from voters. * Reagan also succeeded in obtaining the huge increases in defense spending that he had so fervently sought. By so doing, Reagan had obtained the counterrevolution that he had espoused since the early 1950s—tax cuts, social spending reductions, and defense increases. When characterizing Reagan’s policy successes in 1981, it is important to reiterate that, though he cut the funding of many programs that help low- income persons, he chose not to cut big-ticket social programs with large middle-class constituencies, such as Medicare and Social Security. In subsequent years, he again chose to exclude these programs from his cuts. Indeed, one commentator calls Reagan the guns and butter president because aggregate social spending continued to rise along with defense spending. * He chose to make this strategic concession partly because his aides had calculated that Congress, including many Democrats, would not accede to his increased military spending if he also sought to cut these middle-class programs. Review OBRA, T ax Reductions, and Deregulation EP 2a A host of conservative policies were included within the complex tangle of the OBRA legislation, which recommended budget cuts that totaled $40 billion for 1982 and an additional $50 billion by 1984. First, the legislation terminated some programs—for example, CETA, the public service program for unemployed workers. Second, deep cuts were made in many means-tested programs. The extent of the cuts in these programs for low- income persons was deeply disturbing to many liberals—and Reagan relentlessly sought to cut these programs further in succeeding years. All told, Reagan managed during his administration to cut AFDC by 17.4%; 400,000 persons were removed from the rolls. One million persons lost eligibility for food stamps; the program was cut by 14.3%. The social services block grant, which provided an array of services to poor people, was cut by 23.5%. * In the Department of Housing and Urban Development, funding for low- and moderate-income housing was reduced from $33.5 billion in 1981 to $14 billion in 1987—a cut of 57%. * Third, OBRA enacted indirect methods of cutting expenditures. Believing that social programs should assist only truly needy persons, Reagan hoped to reduce the number of able-bodied persons who received welfare and other benefits. * To do so, he reduced eligibility for food stamps, state AFDC programs, and unemployment insurance. He also eliminated work incentive payments in the AFDC program so that many working women LO 9-7 could no longer receive welfare benefits, even if they were beneath official poverty lines. AFDC rolls were cut dramatically by this policy, but it was ironic that an administration that wanted to encourage, even require, work for welfare recipients had provided a disincentive to work by forcing many women working in low-wage jobs to return to welfare rolls. * The Economic Recovery Tax Act that passed the Congress in August of 1981 provided for 20% cuts in the income taxes of most Americans, spread over 3 years, and a major reduction in corporate taxes. * But these cuts were highly inequitable. Between 1981 and 1985, for example, the combined tax rates for the lowest one-fifth of the population went from 8.4% to 10.6% (or $137 in additional taxes per payer), whereas the tax rate of persons in the top one-fifth declined from 27.3% to 24% (or tax reductions of $2,531 per payer). What made these tax increases even more onerous on poor persons was that their pretax income declined during the decade because low-paid service jobs steadily replaced unionized industrial jobs. * The tax legislation also violated the principle of progressive taxation that liberals had traditionally championed; it gave larger tax breaks to rich people than to poor people. Further, the tax credits given in 1973 to low- income persons who earned less than $5,600 were not indexed; their value had been seriously eroded by the inflation of the 1970s. * Reagan issued an executive order in 1981 that gave OMB the duty of reviewing government regulations and deleting those that were not demonstrated to be cost-effective, and a cabinet-level Task Force on Regulatory Relief, chaired by Vice President George H. W. Bush, was established. Between 1980 and 1984, the number of federal regulations was reduced from 90,000 to 76,000. To the consternation of some liberals, the administration drastically reduced regulations in the EEOC, OSHA, and many social programs; key civil rights matters and other provisions were deleted. * Reagan severely curtailed the effectiveness of OSHA, the EEOC, and the Department of Labor’s Office of Contract Compliance Programs. He cut their staffs, delegated many monitoring functions to states, sought to enforce affirmative action only after proof of discrimination by employers had been obtained, and limited affirmative action monitoring to very large corporations. Reagan appointed officials who did not favor affirmative action to oversee its enforcement; for example, he chose Clarence Thomas to head the EEOC, and he appointed Clarence Pendleton to direct the Civil Rights Commission, where he used his power to fight the principle of affirmative action. * Discuss Reagan’ s Loss of Momentum EP 5c It seemed in September 1981 that the Reagan counterrevolution would continue unabated for years to come, but he did not achieve striking policy successes during the remainder of his first term. There were a number of reasons for this loss of momentum. First, the administration split into two factions. * One group, headed by David Stockman and James Baker, feared that the federal deficit would continue to grow uncontrollably unless taxes were increased, further cuts were made in social spending, and reductions were made in defense spending. Another group, which included supply-side economists, adamantly opposed tax increases, which they feared would jeopardize economic growth. They believed that the economic growth generated by the 1981 tax cuts would produce additional tax revenues to ease the federal deficit. Some of them were so confident in this prediction that they did not believe further deep cuts in social programs were needed. Stockman had embraced tax reduction policies uneasily during the early and middle 1980s because he feared massive increases in the federal deficit. However, he advocated delaying or reducing tax cuts in the summer of 1981. * In interviews during the summer and fall of 1981, which were published in December 1981, he admitted that top officials in the administration had tinkered with economic models so as to make it appear that federal deficits would not be exacerbated by the tax cuts, and he alleged that some officials in the administration had used supply-side theory LO 9-8 as a convenient rationale for giving huge tax concessions to affluent persons and corporations (see Insert 9.4 ). * Insert 9.4. Stockman’ s Thoughts in 2010 David Stockman wrote an editorial about 25 years later about Republicans’ simultaneous favoring of large tax cuts and low budget deficits (“Four Deformations of the Apocalypse,” New York Times , Sunday Opinion Section, August 1, 2010, p. 9). He said that Republicans had traditionally favored balanced budgets and low deficits, but then came to support large tax cuts no matter their budget consequences in the Reagan administration and into the Trump presidency. Their policies, Stockman asserted, will eventually create such huge federal debt that inflation will ensue, as well as an inability to fund those programs that Americans do need. Do you agree with Stockman’s assertion? We revisit this issue in the presidencies of G. W. Bush and Donald Trump. Supply-siders were also furious with Stockman and Baker for not protesting the tight-money policy of the Federal Reserve Board. This policy had been devised by its chairman to drive down the extraordinary inflation that plagued the nation, but supply-siders feared that it would create a recession and thereby discredit their approach. Some even believed that Stockman would welcome a recession so as to discredit them. * Both sides in this titanic struggle within the administration were convinced of the rightness of their cause and attributed evil intentions to their opponents. To the delight of supply-siders, Reagan resisted pleas by Stockman and Baker to increase taxes. However, in the spring of 1982, when he finally assented to a large tax increase known as the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA), which took away some of the massive tax concessions given to corporations in 1981, some supply-side officials left the administration. * Rumors circulated of dissension among Meese, Deaver, and Baker. Meanwhile, observers began to wonder whether anyone was in charge at the White House because Reagan appeared to lack understanding of policy issues. * Another factor that slowed Reagan’s momentum was a deep recession, which began in 1981 and extended into 1983. Unemployment rose to double-digit figures; its impact was greatest on people of color, teenagers, and women. The recession contributed to growing doubts about the administration’s economic policies; it also increased the federal deficit because government tax revenues decreased as economic activity slackened. * By the end of fiscal year 1984, the cumulative deficits in the Reagan administration had surpassed the cumulative deficits of all preceding American presidents; indeed, some commentators feared that the United States would be reduced to the status of nations such as Mexico and Brazil, which found their economic growth impeded by the size of interest payments on their national debts. With the recession came growing awareness of the plight of poor persons, who were hard hit by unemployment and the cuts in means-tested social programs. National media ran extended stories about increases in poverty rates across the nation, the growing inequality between rich and poor Americans, and pockets of unemployment in cities like Youngstown and Cleveland, Ohio, where steel and other basic industries had closed plants in response to foreign competition. * Congress was unhappy about the lack of equity in administration policies. Reagan had declared virtually all the entitlement programs off limits for cuts, but he proposed further cuts of means-tested programs for the poor. His tax policies had led to windfall gains for many corporations and affluent persons. The charge that Reagan lacked compassion seemed to be gathering strength in 1982 and 1983 because of the cumulative effects of his budget-cutting and tax policies, as well as his fiscal and monetary policy, which had contributed to the recession. * Many members of Congress also believed they had been manipulated by the White House and by Stockman during budget and tax deliberations in 1981. Should the OMB director, they asked, personally orchestrate budget objectives and goals of Congress? Some in Congress felt betrayed by the White House; although Stockman had implied in 1981 that the OBRA cuts would suffice, he proposed further deep cuts in late 1981 and in succeeding years. Was it fair for Reagan, some asked, to force Congress to make cuts in social programs by reducing government revenues—both by slashing taxes and by dramatically increasing military spending? Moreover, Reagan’s frequent use of television and radio to apply public pressure on Congress made members increasingly resentful (see Insert 9.5 ). * Insert 9.5. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: When to Retreat and when to Resist? Most of the budget cuts of 1981 focused on programs for poor people; so-called middle-class entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security were untouched. Northern Democrats, who represent the liberal wing of the party, faced a dilemma. Many Southern Democrats were defecting to the Republican budget and tax policies. The Reagan presidency seemed to be invincible; Democrats feared that they might be routed in upcoming elections if they obstructed his policies. Yet those policies contradicted deeply held liberal values and violated the principle of social justice. Should liberal Democrats have made a last stand in 1981 against the budget cuts? Should they have opposed both budget cuts and tax cuts, on the grounds that the latter forced the budget cuts by depleting the government’s revenue? Is a principled stand sometimes effective in politics? Liberals faced this same dilemma in coming decades as the nation decided what mix of tax and spending increases would be needed— particularly as many Republicans insisted on making huge tax cuts in the presidencies of George W. Bush and Donald Trump. However, many Democrats had capitulated to Reagan’s blitzkrieg in 1981, they were more willing to resist Reagan’s cuts during the remainder of his first term—especially now that, thanks to the recession, their constituents were more concerned about unemployment than about inflation. In addition, Reagan’s ability to outvote Democrats with a coalition of boll weevils and Republicans was curtailed when the Democrats gained a number of House seats in the congressional elections of 1982. Indeed, some liberal Republicans, known as “gypsy moths,” sided with Democrats against many spending cuts. Though still in disarray, the Democrats held their ground against further cuts, in the hope that they could defeat Reagan in 1984. Evaluate Social Security , Job T raining, and Medicare Reagan’s policy successes during the remainder of his first term were modest, though he was able to obtain additional cuts in social programs, to make major changes in the Social Security program and Medicare, and to create his own job-training legislation. Stockman had hoped from the outset to include Social Security and Medicare in the budget cuts because they constituted a large portion of domestic spending. When he became further concerned about deficits, Stockman pushed the president to rescind the minimum Social Security benefit that was given to persons—such as elderly nuns—who had not paid into the trust fund during their working years. Stockman also sought to institute a penalty for those who sought early retirement benefits. A storm of political protest greeted these proposals when the president made them public. Democrats accused him of reneging on his pledge to exempt the Social Security program from budget cuts, and many Republicans dissociated themselves from policies that they believed could be politically disastrous. The proposals were defeated by a vote of 96 to 0 by the Senate in 1981. * Reagan and most legislators realized, however, that changes had to be made in Social Security because benefit outlays continued to exceed revenues from payroll deductions despite the sharp increases in payroll taxes introduced by President Carter. To deflect controversy from himself, Reagan appointed a blue-ribbon task force, which recommended that the option to take Social Security benefits at age 62 be rescinded and that benefits be delayed until persons reached age 68. The commission also concluded that retired persons whose earnings exceeded $20,000, whether from work or investments, should pay taxes on a substantial portion of their LO 9-9 Social Security benefits, with ensuing revenues to be returned to the trust fund. To decrease the size of reductions in general benefits, many politicians supported the taxation of affluent persons’ benefits, a policy that partially offset the regressive nature of Social Security payroll taxes. * Some of these recommendations received bipartisan support and were enacted in 1983, including the taxing of some benefits received by affluent persons and the phasing upward of the retirement age to age 67 by the year 2027. Reagan also encountered a funding emergency in Part A of the Medicare program, whose outlays for hospital bills had increased faster than payroll tax revenues. Federal Medicare expenditures had increased from $15.2 billion in 1970 to $38.3 billion in 1980 because of the aging of the population, the increasing use of technology, and the failure of government authorities to prevent doctors and hospitals from charging excessive fees and providing unnecessary treatments. * Reagan’s advisors developed an indirect method of restraining Medicare costs. To place pressure on hospitals to discharge patients as soon as possible and to prevent them from charging excessive fees, Congress established national levels of payment for 467 specific diagnoses or diagnostic-related groups (DRGs). Thus, federal authorities paid hospitals an established fee for all patients who were admitted for appendectomies, no matter how long they remained in the hospital or whether they developed complications. The policy led to some decreases in health expenditures by 1986, but critics argued that this reimbursement approach created additional problems. Would not many hospitals try to discharge patients prematurely—or serve only those patients who were not likely to develop complications? Would not affluent persons purchase insurance to finance supplemental services so that, once again, public policy would create a two-tiered system of health care? The formula also seemed to favor the growing network of for-profit hospitals that primarily served those middle- and upper-class clientele who were least likely to experience medical complications. * Federal authorities also wanted to contain the increasing costs of Medicaid, whose combined federal and state funding had increased from $10.9 billion in 1970 to $25.4 billion in 1980. They cut the federal share of Medicaid funding in the OBRA legislation and offered states incentives to reduce the growth rates of Medicaid. Finally, they encouraged states to offer Medicaid contracts only to those hospitals and clinics that offered low bids; as a result, Medicaid patients found that they could use even fewer providers than were previously available. * The health care system was characterized in 1986 by increasing competition and turmoil. There had been some easing of the rate of price increases for medical care by the middle of the decade, but basic flaws in the American medical system, such as its excessive use of technology and absence of preventive care, still had not been addressed. * Critics lamented continuing inequities in medical care. Roughly 30 million Americans had no health insurance and were ineligible for the means-tested Medicaid program and the age-tested Medicare programs. Millions of Medicaid patients could obtain treatment only in inner-city clinics, partly because most physicians would not serve Medicaid patients for reasons of financial self-interest; they received considerably larger fees from other insurers. * Federal authorities had not developed adequate policies to help elderly patients with chronic health problems. Medicare was intended to help elderly persons with acute conditions. Those with chronic conditions soon exhausted it (and their private insurance) and had to deplete their assets to obtain eligibility for the means-tested Medicaid program, which covered ongoing costs of convalescent homes, nursing homes, and home health care. Medicaid authorities had, in turn, developed confusing and poorly monitored federal and state policies to regulate nursing home care and to fund community-based care of frail and elderly persons. Medicare and Medicaid authorities, as well as private insurance companies, had commissioned a series of experiments in the 1980s to test various community-based methods of helping frail elderly persons, but no comprehensive national policy had been developed by the late 1980s. * Perhaps the most serious health problem of the 1980s was the emergence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which we will discuss in more detail later. * Reagan was determined to terminate the CETA program because he believed its subsidy of tens of thousands of public service jobs in public and not-for-profit agencies interfered with private job markets. After slashing its funds, Reagan finally abolished it in favor of his own program, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), enacted in 1982. The federal government gave funds with relatively few restrictions to states, which, in turn, funded local private industry councils (PICs). PICs, made up of business, agency, and government officials, awarded contracts to job placement agencies and to local industries, which received a fee for each person that they placed with private business. Critics contended, however, that the training and reimbursement policies of JTPA made it irrelevant to the needs of many low-income persons because placement agencies often were reimbursed only for successful placements. Moreover, the failure of JTPA to provide training and day care subsidies to placement agencies, businesses, or trainees made it impossible for many women and low-income persons to use the program. * In 1981, Reagan had folded 57 categorical programs into seven block grants. In 1982, he proposed to reduce the federal role in social welfare much further by offering to undertake complete federal financing and administration of Medicaid if the states carried full costs and responsibility for AFDC, food stamps, and 43 other programs. To attract the support of governors, he offered to cede to states a limited proportion of federal gasoline and cigarette excise taxes. The proposed swap was defeated, however, for several reasons. Although Reagan claimed that he did not want to shortchange the states, astute analysts computed that the scheme would lead them to suffer large net losses in revenue. As in the case of the OBRA block grants, Reagan could not resist the impulse to couple defederalization with budget cuts. Officials in industrialized states in the Midwest and New England, which had particularly high expenses for welfare, believed that defederalization would mainly benefit Sun Belt states, where oil and gas production, as well as high rates of economic growth, already provided sufficient resources to address social needs. * Many state officials were disinclined to support the scheme because they were still angry at the budgetary turmoil provoked by Reagan’s earlier cuts. Reductions in federal funding for social programs had meant that local authorities had to assume additional expenses at the very time when popular tax revolts had led to sharp reductions in local taxes. Few federal legislators desired to carry defederalization further because they derived political support from federal programs. The Reagan years put both federal and state budgets in the red. The huge deficits at the federal level meant that congressional officials devoted more time to the budgetary process than to other, more pressing domestic issues. Moreover, the deficits placed extraordinary pressure on programs for low- income persons, as we have noted. The budgets of many states rose sharply in the 1980s, as they sought to address problems of family dissolution, homelessness, AIDS, and drug and crack babies; they also faced costs due to immigration from abroad, increased costs of prisons, remarkable increases in Medicaid and AFDC costs, and a doubling of education spending—all during a decade when federal aid went from $110 billion in 1978, in inflation-adjusted dollars, to $88 billion in 1982 and only back up to $96 billion by 1990. Indeed, when AFDC and portions of the Medicaid program are not considered, federal aid to the states fell by one-third during the 1980s. * These escalating social costs, coupled with federal cuts, caused serious budget deficits in many local jurisdictions. Assess Moral Reforms The Moral Majority had hoped that Reagan would take strong action to stop abortions, to attack pornography, to allow prayer in public schools, and to provide tax concessions for tuition payments to private schools, but their confidence in him was premature. Reagan knew that these issues, like temperance in the 19th century and in the 1920s, were divisive. The demand for tax concessions for the tuition costs of private schools was widely viewed as public underwriting of educational segregation. Many women opposed a constitutional amendment to override the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion. Many persons in both parties opposed federal legislation or a constitutional amendment to allow prayer in schools, and civil libertarians stoutly resisted federal laws to outlaw pornography. Reagan feared that personal identification with these divisive issues would jeopardize his other budget-cutting, tax, and deregulatory legislation. * Accordingly, he voiced support for moral reforms but did not invest time or resources in them. Meese became Reagan’s emissary to leaders of the Moral Majority and tried to placate them. Disappointed by Reagan’s inaction, the Moral Majority nevertheless had notable victories. Congress continued to disallow use of Medicaid funds for abortion and to cut funds for family planning, which the Moral Majority believed fostered promiscuity. The Justice Department advocated the Moral Majority’s position in court cases regarding pornography, school prayer, and other matters, though it received few favorable rulings. A Presidential Commission on Pornography requested national censorship of magazines like Playboy in 1986. The Supreme Court upheld a Georgia statute that declared acts of sodomy between consenting adults to be illegal. The Moral Majority and its allies also developed expertise in targeting liberal legislators in election campaigns. Vast media, advertising, mailing, LO 9-10 and door-to-door campaigns sought to portray liberal candidates as murderers (of fetuses), supporters of pornography, and atheists. By engaging in character assassination of liberal candidates, the Moral Majority and its allies allowed conservative candidates to take the high road and yet still reap the electoral benefits. These tactics contributed to the defeat of a number of liberal legislators in close races. * The nation was hardly embracing the tenets of the Moral Majority, however. Courts often ruled against them in school prayer, pornography, and abortion cases. Their tactics in political campaigns sometimes caused a sympathy vote for liberal candidates. Many observers wondered whether a secular and urban society would truly accept the ideas of individuals who, like temperance crusaders in earlier periods, sought to impose their moral standards on others. * Review the Election of 1984 Reagan relished the opportunity to face Walter Mondale, the Democratic candidate in 1984, who not only had served as vice president to the unpopular Jimmy Carter but was also identified with unions and liberalism. After some vacillation, Reagan’s resolve to run again was strengthened by improvement in the nation’s economy following the recession of 1983. * The election in 1984 was a rerun of the 1980 campaign. Many major Democratic candidates ran in the presidential primaries. Mondale obtained early endorsements from trade unions, as well as from professional groups, but Senator Gary Hart made Mondale appear politically vulnerable by winning decisive victories in key primaries. These two candidates represented a deep split in the Democratic Party. Some Democrats, including civil rights groups, many trade unions, intellectuals, and some mayors, continued to embrace federal social welfare programs and civil rights. Mondale felt most at home with this group, but even here he had to contend with the African American civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, whose determined campaign mobilized unprecedented numbers of African American voters. Other Democrats, such as Hart, were neoliberals who disdained major increases in social spending but favored federal incentives to promote American industry’s ability to compete with the Japanese. * Hart’s support came mainly from young professionals who had little knowledge of social reform movements in either the Great Depression or the Great Society. * Mondale finally won the Democratic nomination, but he did not overcome Reagan’s lead in the polls. In a major victory for feminists, Mondale chose Geraldine Ferraro as the vice presidential candidate, but her family finances became a major campaign issue that slowed Mondale’s momentum. Mondale tried to make the mounting budget deficit a campaign issue—he actually proposed major increases in federal taxes—but the issue was too LO 9-11 abstract for most voters, who did not believe the deficits slowed economic growth and did not like his remedy of increased taxes. As front-runner, Reagan avoided substantive issues during most of the campaign and focused instead on his leadership and personal skills, as well as his success in restoring economic growth. As in 1980, he targeted white voters and used code words like affirmative action and quotas to mobilize them against the Democrats. By holding his own during his second televised debate with Mondale, he deflected the charge that he was too old to be president. He won another landslide victory, though the Democrats maintained their numbers in Congress. Analyze Reagan’ s Second Term Unlike Reagan’s victory in 1980, when tax and budget reduction were his central themes, his reelection in 1984 did not constitute a mandate for specific policies. The American people, who stood to the left of Reagan in public opinion polls, liked him as a person, believed him to be a decisive leader, and favored his buildup of the military, but did not elect him to continue his assault on the welfare state. The politics of his second term can best be described as a stalemate. As in his first term, Reagan used the specter of the federal deficit to increase pressure on Congress to reduce social spending. Once again, he proposed massive increases in defense spending—in particular, for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a space-based, laser-guided antimissile system for which appropriate technology had not yet been developed. At an estimated cost of $1 trillion, spread over a decade, this program quickly became a priority of defense spending. However, congressional legislators balked at his proposals to cut domestic spending, and even made modest increases in some programs. Entitlements remained out of bounds for cuts, though Reagan tried to cut them indirectly by proposing major increases in consumer fees for services subsidized by Medicare. In this stalemated atmosphere, an unlikely coalition in Congress enacted legislation to address the unprecedented federal deficits, which had continued to increase. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, was enacted by Congress in 1985. Furious that Reagan proposed neither tax increases nor cuts in military spending to alleviate the deficit, members of Congress assented to a measure that required across-the-board cuts in domestic and military programs if specific planned reductions in the federal deficit did not occur that would eventually bring the budget into balance. But this measure could hardly be expected to eliminate the deficit, inasmuch as it LO 9-12 implied that the basic problem was spending , rather than the combination of inadequate revenues (from taxes) and large military budgets. It was this combination of tax cuts and increases in military spending that had led to the budget deficits in 1981, but few politicians wanted to propose tax increases. A few legislators proposed sharp decreases in military spending, but most politicians were hesitant to cut the defense budget when it funded projects in their districts. Many commentators doubted that Congress would actually bring the budget into balance even with the enactment of Gramm- Rudman-Hollings. When viewed in tandem, Reagan’s military, budget, and tax policies placed extraordinary downward pressure on two kinds of social programs: means- tested entitlements (such as food stamps and SSI) and social programs funded by the discretionary budget. His military buildup exceeded the combined size of military spending for the Korean and Vietnam conflicts as the United States hugely increased the size of its navy and air force, developed scores of new weapons, and launched a fleet of new submarines —at a time when the United States was not engaged in a shooting war. Reagan coupled these huge increases in military spending with large increases in interest payments on the massive debt that he had created when he cut taxes so deeply in 1981. (Reagan’s cumulative deficits were larger than all deficits of all presidents in American history combined.) Reagan also decided to exempt “big-ticket” entitlements that were popular with the middle and upper classes from cuts, particularly Medicare and Social Security. Having created these huge deficits, Reagan took almost no responsibility for resolving them. Each year, he submitted a “dead-on-arrival” budget that retained his military buildup and that rejected major increases in taxes. Various leaders in Congress, in turn, would often propose to redress the deficits by raising taxes, cutting military spending, or cutting Medicare or Social Security—but Reagan would not support these policies and other legislators would often oppose them as well. In this stalemated environment, Reagan’s policies of 1981—tax cuts, huge military spending, and massive deficits—remained largely intact. In this environment of budgetary scarcity, Reagan annually sought to cut deficits by slashing funding for discretionary social programs even further than they had been cut in 1981—and he proposed further cuts in food stamps, Medicaid, and SSI. Only the determined opposition of congressional liberals prevented Reagan from achieving these cuts, but liberals could not increase funding for discretionary social programs or means-tested entitlements when such huge deficits existed. At a time when economic inequality was increasing in the United States as many persons with only high school diplomas lost job prospects as unionized jobs in steel manufacturing, automobile plants, and other basic industries relocated abroad, federal spending on education and vocational training remained stagnant. When economic inequality increased markedly in the 1980s, expenditures of the federal government for discretionary social programs declined in constant dollars and as a share of the gross domestic product. Tax reform became a central issue in Reagan’s second term and eclipsed deficit reduction in congressional deliberations. Finally enacted in 1986 after complicated political maneuvering, the resulting legislation simplified federal taxes by decreasing the number of tax brackets and loopholes, vastly increased corporate taxes, and took roughly 6 million low-wage earners from the tax rolls. But it also repudiated the liberal belief that the federal tax system should be progressive by reducing the top tax bracket of affluent Americans to a modest 33%, which was not much higher than the rate paid by middle- and working-class Americans. Moreover, the tax reform did not generate considerably more revenues than the old tax system, and consequently the federal deficit was not reduced; federal revenues were still insufficient to fund social programs. * Social reformers could nonetheless count several modest victories during Reagan’s second term. The denial of SSI payments to persons with disabilities, which had often been arbitrary and unwarranted during Reagan’s first term, was challenged by several court rulings, and benefits were restored in thousands of cases. The Department of Health and Human Services was forced to concede that many persons with mental disabilities such as schizophrenia could not work and required ongoing assistance from the federal government. * The Family Support Act of 1988 provided funds to the states for training projects and child care to help AFDC recipients enter the labor force, though many critics doubted if the program was sufficiently generous to make much difference. Perhaps most important, Congress managed to fend off Reagan’s continuing demands for further cuts in many social programs, even if funding for programs that helped poor people had not recovered from cuts earlier in the decade. Please go to the MindTap for this book to read about the end of the Cold War during President George H. W. Bush’s term in office—and how this triggered a battle to reduce military expenditures since the threat posed by the Soviet Union was greatly reduced. Read about the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Read about Bush’s major policy achievement: enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that gave persons with mental and physical disabilities civil rights and other protections, including workplace accommodations, accommodations in public transportation and in public buildings, and other protections. The budget battles of the Reagan presidency continued in Bush Sr.’s presidency as the huge deficits created by President Reagan remained in place for years after his presidency. George H. W. Bush lost the presidential election of 1992 against Bill Clinton partly because many Republicans were angry because he reneged on his promise never to raise taxes. Recognize the Oppression of Vulnerable Populations in the Era of Reagan and G. H. W. Bush EP 1a EP 2a EP 3a EP 3b EP 4c EP 5b Many members of vulnerable populations were dismayed when Ronald Reagan became president in 1980 because they knew that the implementation of conservative policies would jeopardize the gains that they had made in the preceding two decades. After all, the twin leaders of the conservative movement, Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater, had both strongly opposed the enactment of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, on the grounds that states should be charged with such matters. Conservatives tended to reject programs that sought to equalize conditions between groups in the population—for example, between people of color and the white majority—on the grounds that they represented reverse discrimination. LO 9-13 Members of vulnerable populations feared, as well, that Reagan (and then Bush) would pack the Supreme Court, as well as lower federal courts, with appointees who would overrule many of the decisions of the Warren and Burger Courts, which had supported civil rights, affirmative action, the legalization of abortion, and desegregation. Conservatives tended to take a strict constructionist approach to constitutional interpretation; that is, rulings had to conform to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution. This doctrine was hardly promising for reformers, in that, as we noted in Chapter 3 , the founders had legitimized slavery in the Constitution, and many contemporary social issues, such as abortion and affirmative action, had not emerged in colonial society. Moreover, enormous gains in employment opportunities for women and people of color had been obtained in the 1960s and 1970s through class action suits identifying patterns of discrimination. However, conservatives generally opposed the assertion of group rights and needs through class action suits; they were inclined to restrict legal recourse to instances when individuals could prove specific discriminatory actions had been taken against themselves by persons who intended to harm them. * Members of the various vulnerable populations realized, even before Reagan’s election, that he would seek to diminish the size and roles of regulatory agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. By weakening these agencies, the Reagan administration could prevent effective implementation of civil rights and related statutes. Members of vulnerable populations were also acutely aware that the conservative movement in the 1970s had bitterly opposed policies to extend their rights, including the Equal Rights Amendment, affirmative action, school desegregation, and local ordinances protecting gay men and lesbians from job discrimination. * Nor were members of vulnerable populations and their advocates sanguine about the prospects for social programs to redress poverty, which provided assistance to many women, African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. Conservative politicians had sought throughout the 1970s to identify programs like AFDC, food stamps, public housing, and public employment with people of color in an effort to capitalize on, and inflame, white citizens’ resentments; it was widely expected that the Reagan administration would scale back these programs. As if these fears were not enough, many members of vulnerable populations expected Reagan’s tax and economic policies to harm low-income Americans. Supply-side economics, which was akin to the trickle-down economics of the 1920s, gave huge tax concessions to affluent persons without necessarily increasing the income of poorer citizens. Strategies to induce economic growth in the economy would not likely include bottom- up approaches such as investing in the nation’s infrastructure and schools or in training programs for its workers. Predictions Come True The Reagan and G. H. W. Bush years constitute the largest redistribution of resources and rights upward in the nation’s history. Though the welfare state remained intact—and specific programs within it grew considerably— from 1980 through 1992, the actual economic situation of poor persons worsened, owing to a deterioration of wages, and reductions in social benefits and services, and increases in Social Security taxes. Those near the bottom of the economic ladder became poorer not only in absolute dollars (adjusted for inflation) but also in comparison with the wealthiest Americans. Moreover, the rights won during the 1960s and 1970s, such as protections against job-related discrimination and the right to abortion, were put at risk by the appointment of conservative justices to the Supreme Court and to lower courts. * It is important to remember that spending cuts and upward redistribution would have been even greater had not many legislators opposed Reagan’s and Bush’s spending policies. Many of the fears of members of vulnerable populations were realized during the Reagan period—particularly during his first term, when the Republicans controlled the Senate and often could muster a conservative majority in the House. Although Bush presented a more accommodating posture, his court appointments, as well as many of his policies, did not represent a fundamental departure from the politics of Reagan, despite conservatives’ anger at Bush for consenting to tax increases and signing civil rights legislation. The Oppression of W omen As Faludi notes, a curious paradox emerged in the 1980s: The women’s liberation movement was widely blamed for depriving women of their femininity, their traditional rights to custody and alimony, and their special protections from hazardous work—in effect, for being too militant and thus jeopardizing traditional rights—yet women remained underpaid, denied access to many kinds of jobs, subject to a “glass ceiling,” and greatly underrepresented in political offices. * Unlike other nations, moreover, the United States lacked a family leave program, and more than 99% of American employers did not provide child care. Family planning services for the poor remained poorly funded, and the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion seemed vulnerable to new court rulings. Attitudes toward women were cast into the public spotlight in 1991, when law professor Anita Hill alleged in Senate hearings that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her while they both worked at the EEOC. The arrogance and insensitivity of the all-male group of senators conducting the hearings radicalized many women. * Women encountered major political opposition in the 1980s from conservatives. Far from insisting that males should assume larger roles in parenting, some spokespersons for the New Right openly advocated turning the clock back to the 1950s with respect to employment of women, abortion rights, and women’s rights. They fought the Equal Rights Amendment and even introduced the Family Protection Act in Congress in 1981, which sought to rescind federal laws that support equal education for boys and girls; prohibit what it called “intermingling of the sexes” in sports or other school-related activities; require schools to endorse marriage and motherhood as the proper career for girls; cut off federal funding to any school that uses textbooks in which women are shown in nontraditional roles; and prevent women who seek abortion counseling or a divorce from obtaining federally funded legal aid. * The decade was characterized by considerable backsliding—for example, fewer women were appointed to the judiciary and to top policy positions. The Supreme Court narrowed women’s rights in the 1989 Webster v. Reproductive Health Services decision, which allowed Missouri to make major new restrictions on abortion; the 1991 Rust v. Sullivan decision, which upheld regulations of the Reagan administration that prohibited federally funded clinics from counseling pregnant women about abortion; and also various rulings attacking affirmative action and quotas. The labor force became even more gender segregated. In 1986, women earned, on average, 64 cents to every dollar earned by male workers—the same ratio that had existed 31 years earlier, in 1955. The EEOC no longer vigorously litigated cases against large corporations that excluded women from entire job categories—for example, from high-paying commission sales jobs. The crusade by the New Right against abortions illustrates the temper of the 1980s. Antiabortion groups burned or bombed 77 family planning clinics between 1977 and 1989. By 1987, 85% of counties in the nation did not provide abortion services; as a result, many women had to travel across county or state boundaries to find such services. Medicaid funding had not been available for abortions since the mid-1970s, and only 12 states continued to fund abortions; consequently, women had to obtain funding from a small number of private agencies or from private insurance or personal funds. Muzzled by regulations, health providers that received federal funds could not even discuss reproductive alternatives with women —and sex education classes funded by the Adolescent Family Life Act withheld all information on abortion and birth control from students. * The Democrats did not vigorously attack the Republicans’ indifference to women’s issues, even though many women felt alienated from the Republican Party. Intimidated by the conservatives, they often reflected the antifemale bias of the decade; even Michael Dukakis, the Democratic contender in 1988, chose to be silent on women’s issues. * In 1990, women’s groups and their allies were able to obtain legislation that channeled some funding for child care programs to the states. A coalition of labor, senior citizens’, and women’s groups lobbied for a family leave bill, which would allow men and women paid leave from work before and after the birth of a child. They were able to move it through the Senate in 1991 but ultimately failed to surmount opposition by conservatives, who argued that it represented an unfair obligation for corporations, even though the policy had already been enacted in many industrialized nations. * The Oppression of Poor People and Persons of Color By 1992, a good deal of evidence, assembled by an array of authors and studies, showed that the economic position of the lowest quintile—the lowest one-fifth—of citizens had eroded considerably during the tenure of Presidents Reagan and Bush. * The data implicated three factors: 1. With the loss of American industrial and unionized jobs during the 1970s and 1980s, increasing numbers of workers found an erosion in the real value of their paychecks. Moreover, many companies cut their fringe benefits, such as health benefits, during these two decades— though many enterprises that employed people in the lowest quintile had never provided health benefits. 2. Poor individuals suffered economically as a result of the cuts in social benefits and services of the American welfare state. We have already discussed extensive cuts in AFDC, food stamps, and public housing programs. Poor persons also had to pay higher fees in Medicaid, Medicare, and other social programs. 3. Although some concessions were made in certain tax provisions—such as a tax credit extended by the federal government to some working but poor persons—the overall tax rates of poor and working persons increased, if payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare are added to increases in the regular income tax. The economic decline of the lowest quintile was matched by a decline of persons in the second-lowest quintile. * As the two lowest quintiles suffered these losses, many affluent Americans vastly increased their wealth; for example, the 400 richest Americans saw a tripling of their net worth in this period. * Viewed in this light, the Reagan and Bush years represented an economic counterrevolution. Some observers foresaw a transformation of the U.S. economic structure to resemble that of some developing nations, with vast disparities between rich and poor and a relatively small middle class—indeed, a society resembling that of the Gilded Age, which we discussed in Chapter 4 . Economic data do not fully describe the constricted quality of life in some inner-city neighborhoods where low-income African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans live. These segregated populations have extraordinary rates of poverty, drug usage, poor health, poor educational attainment, unemployment, homicides, and gang violence. Large numbers of low-income males are killed in violent encounters or are incarcerated. And the rates of single-parent families in these inner-city populations have markedly increased over the last 25 years. (See Figure 9.2 .) Yet these neighborhoods cannot accurately be described in negative terms; they had vibrant businesses, churches, and community groups. They elected leaders from their communities. The growth of strong middle-class populations was underway. Figure 9.2. Ivo Roospold/Alamy Stock Photo Homeless man with a pet rabbit and dog. In the 1970s and 1980s, conservative s dominated policy discussions of urban poverty, which were very limited in scope. * However, as Peterson notes, a range of theories to explain the social and economic problems of these segregated populations now exists. Some observers contend that the welfare state has been inadequately developed and does not sufficiently help inner-city residents with economic, health, social service, educational, and job-training remedies. Conservatives argue that inner-city residents are to blame for the conditions in which they live, and implicate cultural factors that prompt behaviors such as teenage pregnancy. Conservatives maintain that welfare and other programs provide “perverse incentives,” which discourage poor people from seeking work and self-improvement. Others argue that the loss of well-paying unionized industrial jobs in the past 20 years has deprived relatively unskilled persons of employment or consigned them to service jobs that pay only the minimum wage. * As was illustrated by Donald Trump’s negative portrayals of communities of color, in his presidential campaign in 2016, however, many people thrived in them. When discussing the community where she was raised on the Southside of Chicago, Michelle Obama countered that his portrayals don’t describe the community of hardworking and community-oriented people that she experienced during her childhood. The Reagan and G. H. W. Bush administrations, as well as presidential candidates in 1980, 1984, and 1988, displayed scant interest in these inner- city problems. Although the Los Angeles unrest of May 1992 suggested the need for sweeping social reforms to bring inner-city residents into the economic mainstream, the palliatives proposed by Congress and the Bush administration in the wake of the urban unrest provided little prospect of decisive action. And with huge federal deficits, as well as budget deficits in most states and major cities, funds to assist this population were not available—and would not be available, as long as the nation was disinclined either to raise its taxes or to dramatically cut its defense spending. Public opinion remained indifferent to inner-city residents, whose plight was largely invisible to the white suburban majority. The Oppression of Immigrants The enactment of the Immigration Act of 1965 and succeeding legislation— such as the 1975 Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act and the 1980 Refugee Act—heralded a large influx of immigrants to the United States from Central America and Mexico and also from Asian nations such as Vietnam, China, Laos, Thailand, India, Cambodia, South Korea, and the Philippines. This immigration legislation revolutionized patterns of inflows of persons to the United States. National quotas were abolished, as were discriminatory Asian restrictions. Previously, only 120,000 visas had been reserved for Eastern Hemisphere nations from the overall ceiling of 270,000 established by 1980 legislation. Legislation in 1985 established three immigrant groups. First, immediate relatives of American citizens were exempt from the overall ceiling. Second, some immigrants entered under the overall ceiling of 270,000, though every foreign country was limited to 20,000 visas annually. Third, refugees were admitted annually in numbers to be determined by the president after consultation with Congress. These new arrivals came to join relatives, to escape political persecution, or to seek better conditions. The Asian American population grew from 1 million in 1965 to 5 million in 1985; the number of Asians arriving in that 20-year period was almost four times as great as the Asian influx between 1849 and 1965. * Though immigrants settled disproportionately on the West Coast, large enclaves existed throughout the nation. The immigrant population was so diverse that generalizations are difficult and fraught with inaccuracy. Some immigrants were highly educated professionals and persons with sophisticated technical skills. Others gravitated to businesses. Refugees from Vietnam, Central America, and the Caribbean, including boat people, came from a wide range of social backgrounds. Even some entrants who possessed advanced skills found the adjustment problematic, not only because of language difficulties but also because of discrimination in employment and in society at large. About half of those Vietnamese refugees who reside in California were on public assistance in 1990. * Some refugees suffered from mental trauma due to harrowing experiences in refugee camps and war zones. As with immigrants in preceding eras, tensions often developed between first-generation immigrants and their children, who quickly learned English and the mores of the dominant culture. Advocates for refugees from political persecution in countries like El Salvador fought a determined battle to stop their deportation, through the courts and through hearings of the Immigration Service; these refugees were offered sanctuary in churches and homes. Congress had long wondered what to do with millions of undocumented workers who had come from Mexico and Central America to the United States. Agribusiness, tourism, factories, and other employers relied heavily on this low-wage labor force. Yet they were a fugitive population contributing taxes to Social Security and often paying income taxes, but with uncertain rights to social services, health care, and education. If they were assaulted or subject to other criminal actions, they could not call the police and seek legal recourse for fear of deportation. In many cases, employers paid them less than the minimum wage because they knew these workers feared to question authorities. Many immigrants worked in places where working conditions were unsafe, such as in meatpacking plants in beef and poultry industries and in garment factories. Work safety standards were often not enforced by federal and state authorities. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was enacted in this context. It granted asylum to 3 million undocumented workers in the United States if they could prove they had lived in the country for at least 4 years. Able now to obtain visas and apply for citizenship, this group finally had legal status after years of contributing to the nation’s economy. This legislation resulted from bipartisan action by President Reagan and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate. Many legislators assumed that this legislation would slow the movement of persons across the Mexican border into the United States as well as from other nations. Had some of them realized that immigration into the United States would accelerate after the legislation was enacted, they might not have supported it. The number of undocumented immigrants had increased to roughly 12 million persons by 2008 as legislation to create amnesty for most of them in another piece of legislation stalled in Congress (see Insert 9.6 ). Insert 9.6. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: What Policies Should Americans Adopt for Undocumented Immigrants? Many Americans did not realize in 1986 that the world economy had already shifted toward globalization, a process in which labor and capital moved across national boundaries at an accelerating rate. Even a decade earlier, for example, automobile manufacturers such as Toyota were viewed as purveyors of cheap products that could not compete against American industry. (By 2008, Toyota had surpassed General Motors as the world’s largest automobile company.) Spurred by the quest for jobs, as well as the desire to join family members, many persons crossed national boundaries even without following formal immigration procedures. Americans would have to grapple with difficult issues in coming decades, including questions such as these: To what extent should “amnesty” be extended to persons who have crossed borders without following formal immigration procedures? To what extent should immigration be allowed for relatives of persons who crossed borders without following formal immigration procedures? To what extent is a “guest worker” program advisable, such as the so-called bracero program that existed from 1942 to 1964? Do guest worker programs inevitably lead to poor treatment of immigrants? Should strong sanctions exist—and be monitored—against employers of persons who crossed borders without following formal immigration procedures? Since the United States took much of the American Southwest from Mexico by force of arms in the Mexican-American War (as discussed in Chapter 4 ), do immigrants from Mexico have a right to enter the United States even when not following formal immigration procedures? Is the contemporary “sanctuary movement,” where churches shelter persons who would otherwise be deported, meritorious? Should “sanctuary cities” in 2017 that do not identify and refer undocumented persons to federal immigration authorities, be penalized by the federal government? Should the U.S. develop an immigration plan, similar but larger than Reagan’s, for its 12 million undocumented immigrants in 2018 and beyond? Many of these new immigrants worked under the same unsafe and unregulated conditions that had existed for many of their predecessors. It was inhumane, moreover, that families were often separated for long periods of time or forever. Many mothers, for example, traveled across borders to earn income to support their families, but left their children with relatives in Mexico and other nations—creating extraordinary family problems. When these children sometimes attempted to cross borders to find their mothers, they often were robbed or even died as they undertook the perilous journey to, and then across, the border. Many immigrants from other nations died in transit, such as when crossing the desert in states such as California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Yet others were victimized by professional guides, known as coyotes , who charged them exorbitant amounts of money and often packed them into unsafe vehicles. The Oppression of Gay Men and Lesbians In the 1970s, gay men and lesbians had focused on winning civil rights, with some success. In the 1980s, however, they found themselves confronting the worst medical catastrophe of modern times, the AIDS epidemic. In the spring of 1982, researchers at the National Centers for Disease Control acknowledged the existence of an epidemic that had already killed 119 persons, but they did not know the cause of the disease and had not even assigned a name to it. However, they knew that it progressively destroyed the immune system and they had determined that it was concentrated in the gay male population. When the virus that caused the disease was finally identified in early 1984 (it was officially designated the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, in 1986), the horrific nature of the epidemic became clear. Transmitted by an exchange of fluids during sexual relations, the disease threatened to become a sort of biologic genocide visited on an unsuspecting population. The gay community made unrelenting efforts to mobilize action against the epidemic. Edward Brandt, the assistant secretary for health, who asked in early 1984 for a modest outlay of $55 million on research to develop a blood test, a vaccine, and a cure, encountered indifference from the Reagan administration. The American Life Lobby, a conservative group, claimed that Brandt’s plea to make AIDS a top priority of the Health Service was “an outrageous legitimization of a lifestyle repugnant to the vast majority of Americans.” * Researchers discovered by mid-1984 that the disease was also transmitted through blood transfusions, through intravenous drug use, by prostitutes, and by bisexuals to their spouses. The disease spread rapidly among African American and Latino addicts in the inner city who shared nonsterilized needles. Americans are prone to cycles of interest in particular social problems. After a rash of news reports on the disease in 1983, coverage soon diminished, despite the mounting deaths. The Reagan administration requested only $51 million for 1985. At the same time, conservatives in Congress sought to require that health workers conducting blood tests for AIDS report positive results to public health departments. It was widely feared that this policy, which would compromise the confidentiality of the AIDS test, would lead to boycotts of the test because persons with AIDS encountered virulent prejudice and discrimination in housing, in the workplace, and also from insurance companies. Though congressional pressure pushed funding to $96 million in 1985, the Reagan administration sought to reduce the funding to $85.5 million in the ensuing year, despite a prediction by government researchers that the epidemic could kill up to 50,000 persons (or the same number of fatalities as occurred during the Vietnam conflict) within a few years. * The gay community developed a massive education and self-help campaign to provide assistance to people with AIDS and to promote safe sex, but they received scant assistance from the federal government. African American and Latino communities proved less able to develop self-help campaigns, partly because of prejudices against gay men in those cultures. Government authorities did not make it a priority to develop a determined preventive program in inner-city areas; this failure, which consigned thousands of persons to death, was a national disgrace. With the revelation that movie star Rock Hudson had AIDS in mid-1985, and the publication of a report on the epidemic by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in October 1986, government action increased markedly. However, increases in funding were still sufficiently modest that gay men, lesbians, and their allies repeatedly demonstrated in Washington; a 1987 march attracted 600,000 people. Efforts to combat the disease continued to be hamstrung by prejudice: Many states failed to enact laws prohibiting discrimination against people with AIDS; there was widespread opposition to providing addicts with sterilized needles; many physicians decided not to treat persons who were HIV-positive; and conservatives continued to demand mandatory reporting of persons who tested HIV-positive. Nor did President Bush demonstrate active interest in the issue. Moreover, the nation’s disinclination to provide sex education and condoms to its youth had slowed effective preventive programs. Although the public schools of New York City decided in 1991 to distribute condoms to high school students, most other school districts were not as enlightened. Nor did Americans develop public service announcements, such as were widely used in European countries, to promote safe sex. Activists hoped that the announcement by basketball player Magic Johnson in late 1991 that he was HIV-positive might finally force a massive prevention program. As the epidemic neared the end of its first decade in the United States, the death toll exceeded 138,000 persons, and the disease was making rapid advances in heterosexual populations, particularly among intravenous drug users. About 1 million persons were HIV-positive in May of 1992. Though often preoccupied with AIDS, gay and lesbian activists also worked on many other fronts. They sought legislation in various states to outlaw job discrimination in the civil service, military, police and fire departments, and private markets; to outlaw housing discrimination; to allow same-gender couples to obtain access to Social Security and job-related fringe benefits; to obtain the right to adopt children; to obtain custody and visitation rights; and to overturn antisodomy laws in 26 states. * The Oppression of People with Disabilities Buoyed by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a robust movement of persons with disabilities evolved and mobilized behind an “independent living centers” movement. Wishing to shed traditional images of helplessness, some advocates favored the term physically challenged to describe persons with disabilities. A national network of local organizations received federal funding to provide an array of outreach, educational, and advocacy services, with the intent of freeing persons from dependence on medical institutions. When possible, these organizations helped secure government payments for nonworking persons with disabilities, whether under the means-tested SSI program or under Social Security disability insurance (SSDI) for persons disabled on the job. With the use of technology and advocacy, they also succeeded in increasing the employment of persons with chronic physical, developmental, and mental problems. Many public facilities were made accessible by way of ramps, elevators, and other aids, and vast progress was made in obtaining special programs to help persons with conditions like dyslexia in the educational system. Even with these improvements, many persons with chronic conditions remained mired in poverty or lacked access to the latest technology. Equally important, persons with chronic problems often needed personal assistants to help them with chores, transportation, and other matters, but government programs rarely provided these aides. Moreover, persons with chronic problems often encountered a dilemma: If they worked, their benefits would be taken from them, but the wages they could earn were so low that they needed their benefits to survive. Many persons with disabilities thus returned to their SSI or SSDI benefits rather than remaining in the workforce. Advocates obtained enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which barred discrimination in the workplace, housing, and public accommodations. (It provided far more detailed language than the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.) Though this legislation represented progress, activists feared that the government would confine itself to policing the rights of persons with disabilities, rather than funding an array of services— such as personal aides—that they needed to become full-fledged members of society. * The Oppression of Poor Children The well-being of children depends on the economic and social condition of their parents, as well as on the kinds of health, educational, and social service programs that society provides them. In the 1980s, the scorecard was not impressive on either count. After declining in the 1960s and remaining stable in the 1970s, the rates of poverty among children and youth rose rapidly to around 25% in the early 1980s and then stabilized at those high levels for the rest of the decade. Although roughly 15% of white children were poor in 1989, about 44% of African American children and 36% of Latino children were poor. Falling earnings, low levels of AFDC and food stamps, and poor child support enforcement contributed to this high rate. The poverty of growing numbers of children was linked, as well, to the growth in the percentage of families that had only a single head of household. The term feminization of poverty was coined to describe the extent of poverty in female-headed households. If women headed only 23% of all poor families in 1959, 52% of them were headed by women by 1989. About 51% of children in families headed by a woman were poor in 1989 compared with only 10% in two-parent families. Families headed by a woman tend to be poorer because they can draw on only a single source of wage income and because women tend to be segregated in lower-paying work. * According to Ozawa, increasing rates of teenage pregnancy and of divorce explain the growth in female-headed households. * As well as poverty, American children faced an array of other problems, for which no adequate policies had been developed. Roughly 300,000 cocaine- addicted babies were born each year, and drug treatment and prevention programs had failed to reach many teenagers who used drugs. Between 1965 and 1988, the arrest rate for violent crimes by 18-year-old males more than doubled; rates were particularly high in the lower economic strata. Homicides accounted for almost half of all deaths among young males. As Kozol documents in his book Savage Inequalities , the schools of poor children were overcrowded, lacked instructional aids, and often had less competent teachers than more affluent districts. * There were many indications that the child welfare system could not cope with the sheer number of children who were reported to be neglected or abused by their caregivers. In the wake of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, which gave funds to the states to hire more child welfare staff and required them to develop a “permanency plan” for all children removed from their natural homes, the number of children in foster care was almost halved in 5 years. But the number zoomed upward by 29%, to about 360,000 children by 1991—and was predicted to exceed 500,000 children by the year 2000. (This threshold was reached as early as 1997.) Though staff were added in many jurisdictions, acute shortages developed because of a 147% increase in reports of abused and neglected children between 1979 and 1989, for an astonishing total of 2.4 million reported cases in 1989. * Children’s advocates nonetheless gained a number of incremental policy victories in the 1980s and seemed on the verge of some additional ones in 1992. By securing more funding for the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, millions of disabled children were mainstreamed into the regular public schools. The Medicaid program was amended to include a program that gave 1 million low-income children preventive checkups. Despite its inadequate funding and implementation, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act led to better foster care for many children, as well as higher rates of adoption and reunification with their natural families. In 1991, under pressure from children’s advocates, Congress agreed in principle to expand the Head Start program to cover all eligible children in coming years. In the 1980s, incremental increases had been obtained in the Earned Income Tax Credit—a means-tested program that gave a tax rebate to qualifying families—and Congress agreed to raise the credit so that the benefit would rise another 70% by 1994. (A family earning less than $10,730 could claim a tax refund of almost $1,000 in 1990.) With passage of the Child Care and Development Block Grant program in 1990, children’s advocates finally obtained the first major, national child care program since World War II. It channeled funds through the states for child care services, administration, and staff training. Although the program was inadequately funded, it established a precedent that child care belonged within the purview of the federal government. The AFDC program had been highly controversial since the mid-1960s, when many citizens became alarmed at its rate of growth. But the benefits of this program, which was designed to help destitute heads of households and their children, had eroded during the 1970s and 1980s to the point where the grants of the median state were only 45% of the official poverty line in 1990, or only $367 a month for a family of three. Even when supplemented by food stamps and Medicaid, these resources were insufficient to meet the basic needs of many families. When the Family Support Act of 1988 was enacted, people hoped that its job training and child care funds would allow many women on AFDC to enter the labor market, but the act fell far short of its potential, owing to inadequate funding at federal and state levels and the harsh realities of labor markets; relatively unskilled female workers often could obtain only minimum-wage jobs that rendered them even poorer than they had been on AFDC. Thus, incremental gains in some aspects of children’s welfare during the decade were offset by the rapid growth of social problems—such as cocaine-addicted babies and huge increases in reported cases of child abuse and neglect—that existing programs could not adequately address. Children’s advocates urged the United States to emulate programs in Europe and Canada, such as parental leave, expanded child care, and children’s allowances. * The Oppression of Aging Americans Aging Americans appeared at first glance to have improved their condition in the 1970s and 1980s. Rates of poverty in this population had plummeted from 35% to 12.8% between 1959 and 1989. With the enactment of Medicare and the Older Americans Act in 1965 and the enactment of SSI and the indexing of Social Security in the early 1970s, older people obtained major new medical services, social services, and resources. Indeed, many commentators noted that a huge portion of the federal budget was devoted to older persons, including the 29.4% of the 1990 federal budget (or $341.4 billion) consumed by just two programs—Medicare and Social Security. Unlike poor Americans, elderly persons were largely spared the budget cuts of the 1980s because Reagan (and then Bush) feared antagonizing this politically powerful group. * But elderly persons had many serious problems of their own. Because consumer fees associated with Medicare were so high and so many services were not covered, elderly persons paid roughly 50% of their own medical costs. Moreover, they paid upward of 50% of their costs for home health care and long-term care because Medicare, with its focus on short-term, hospital-based care, offered scant coverage for those services. As a result, many older citizens experiencing catastrophic health conditions had to divest themselves of their savings to obtain medical funds from the means- tested Medicaid program in a process known as “spending down.” * Moreover, many older persons and their families were heavily burdened— financially and otherwise—by Alzheimer’s disease, which had become the fourth greatest killer of older persons by 1992. Day treatment and other services for persons with Alzheimer’s disease were very limited. As if these problems were not enough, older persons also had to contend with a strong movement in the 1980s that sought to cut social spending on their needs. Former Governor Richard Lamm of Colorado and others argued that much of the money spent on older Americans should be diverted to children because society would reap economic gains by making younger people more productive. Daniel Callahan, a prominent moral philosopher, advocated that the United States refuse heroic and expensive health remedies to all persons over the age of 80—for example, by disallowing stays in intensive care units—so as to permit these funds to be spent on younger people. Others argued that lobbyist groups representing older persons, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (now known as AARP), possessed such power that older citizens were able unfairly to obtain a disproportionate share of the public purse. In an era of deficits in federal and state budgets, many legislators feared making home health care and long-term care more available because of its likely costs. * See Insert 9.7 . Yet surely the nation should fund the needs both of children and elderly persons advocates for elderly persons contended. Insert 9.7. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: Pitting Groups against One Another It is true: Older Americans absorb a large share of the expenditures of the welfare state, partly on account of the high cost of their medical programs and long-term care programs. It is also true that children receive a small share of social spending in the United States. Analyze the ethical merit of cutting expenditures for older people to divert funds to children. Some ethicists favor, for example, making a rule that no person over age 80 can receive extraordinary medical interventions. Others want older citizens to self-fund far larger portions of their health care expenses and other costs. The Oppression of Homeless Persons Many social problems of the 1980s and 1990s had an impact on individuals from several outgroups, as well as the general population. Consider homelessness. As the 1980s began, most Americans would likely have associated homelessness with relatively small areas of cities where alcoholic persons resided. (Such an area was often known as skid row.) A public opinion poll in 1991, however, found that 54% of Americans reported they saw homeless people in their communities or on their way to work—and the Urban Institute in 1987 estimated the homeless population of the United States at about 600,000 persons, including persons in shelters, using soup kitchens, and on the streets (see Figure 9.3 ). Homeless people are a diverse group. When examining the characteristics of homeless people in cities of more than 100,000 people, the Urban Institute concluded that about one-fifth of them had a history of mental hospitalization; about 15% were children; about 81% were male; about one-third had been patients in a detoxification, alcohol treatment, or drug treatment program; and about 29% of single men had served time in prison. These homeless people had an average monthly income of $135, or less than one-third of the federal poverty level, and half of them had not had a steady job in more than 2 years. Persons had been homeless for a median of 10 months. * Figure 9.3. Details A. Ramey/PhotoEdit The resurgence of homelessness in the 1980s. The response of federal and state governments to this problem in the Reagan and Bush era was halfhearted, at best. Most vexing to advocates for the homeless was the presidents’ disinclination to publicly discuss the issue; even Democratic candidates in 1984 and 1988 were unwilling to demand ameliorative policies. Congress enacted the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, but it focused its resources on construction costs for shelters and was burdened with bureaucratic delays in disbursing funds to states. States and localities devoted considerable funds to the problem by the late 1980s and were particularly effective in meeting the emergency needs of those homeless people who used their shelters. But most jurisdictions made little provision for outreach programs to homeless people who avoided organized services and shelters, transitional programs to help homeless people obtain housing and jobs, and programs to help prevent people from becoming homeless. Nor did most jurisdictions provide case management services to homeless persons, even in shelters. For want of leadership from federal or state authorities, voluntary agencies —including missions, churches, neighborhood coalitions, and social agencies—often took the lead in providing services. * As Rossi notes, it is easy to ignore the simple fact that “the essential and defining symptom of homelessness is lack of access to conventional housing.” * The stocks of inexpensive housing were depleted in the 1980s by rising rents, conversion of many rental apartments to condominiums, and the continuing destruction of low-income housing (particularly buildings with apartments for single persons) for urban renewal. As we have already noted, the Reagan administration virtually ended many programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Furthermore, the policy of deinstitutionalizing patients from the nation’s mental hospitals from the early 1960s onward, when coupled with stricter rules for involuntary commitments, placed hundreds of thousands of former mental patients on the streets without adequate services. And increasing numbers of individuals and families could not afford housing because of the loss of industrialized, unionized employment in the United States during the 1980s. Discuss the Erosion of Legal Rights A prime objective of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush was to transform the federal judiciary into an instrument of conservative ideology. They succeeded to an extent unrivaled in modern times. With the appointment of Justice Clarence Thomas in late 1991, the number of liberals on the Supreme Court had been reduced to two justices (Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens). Under the leadership of William Rehnquist, who succeeded Warren Burger in 1986, the Court seemed poised to stress conservative goals in the 1990–1991 session, when it overturned a number of precedents and contemplated “shattering the Warren and Burger legacies … in the areas of abortion, separation of church and state, affirmative action, and free speech.” * Moreover, by 1992, Reagan and Bush had appointed more than half of the 828 federal appeals and court judges in the United States—judges who had usually been given “ideological litmus tests” to be certain that they would support conservative positions on controversial issues. * It was too soon to tell precisely what directions the Supreme Court would take, but advocates for women and people of color feared a rollback in many policies that had been sanctioned by the Warren or Burger Court or by Congress. Advocates realized that they would need to secure new legislation to offset adverse rulings by the Court; thus, gay activists, chagrined that the Supreme Court in 1986 upheld a Georgia statute that declared sodomy illegal, responded by pressuring state legislatures to overturn similar statutes. Advocates for people with disabilities secured the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, after the Court had declined to cover people with disabilities under existing civil rights statutes. Another landmark in this campaign of resistance was the Civil Rights Act of 1991, enacted after 2 years of negotiations between Congress and the LO 9-14 White House. This legislation was a response to a series of ten rulings by the Supreme Court that called into question the principle of affirmative action and limited individuals’ ability to seek remedies to bias in the workplace. In its decision in 1989 in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio , for example, the Court held that the burden of proof rested with an employee who alleged that a company’s practices had an adverse impact on people of color, women, or other groups; she or he had to prove that the practices did not serve a legitimate business purpose. The antidiscrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 applied to both government and private places of employment and reaffirmed the ability of employees to bring “disparate impact lawsuits” under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 —that is, lawsuits alleging that specific hiring or promotion decisions adversely affected women, people of color, or other groups. The legislation also allowed workers to seek monetary damages in cases of alleged intentional discrimination. * The ideological divergence between Congress and the Supreme Court suggested that the House and Senate would be revisiting issues during the next decades that they thought they had resolved, until the Court declared the relevant statutes unconstitutional. In effect, the rulings of the Supreme Court were setting a major portion of Congress’s legislative agenda, which was frustrating and time-consuming for liberal and moderate lawmakers. This standoff was reminiscent of the New Deal era, when the intransigence of the conservative Court led Franklin Roosevelt to try to pack the Court with liberal justices. As a final example of the Court’s uncompassionate rulings, note that in March of 1992, by a 7 to 2 vote, the Court found that federal judges cannot force states to improve their care of abused and neglected children under the 1980 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act because it did not specifically mention that persons can sue in federal court. Outraged children’s advocates faced the task of amending the legislation in Congress. * Discuss the Social W ork Profession The profession of social work proved remarkably resilient during the decades after the Great Society, despite the conservative attack on the kinds of social programs that employed social workers. Schools of social work at the graduate level held their own during this period, as did undergraduate programs. Membership of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) exceeded 100,000 persons by the mid-1980s, and roughly nine- tenths of them had a master’s in social work; more than 200,000 persons in the workforce had either a bachelor’s or master’s degree in social work. About 40% of NASW members were employed in not-for-profit agencies, 45% in public agencies (mostly at state, county, or local levels), and the balance in for-profit agencies. Large numbers of social workers were employed in health, mental health, and child and family sectors. Though most social workers held direct service positions, many held administrative posts, and some worked in community-organizing and policy-making positions as well. The profession had successes and failures in political battles to preserve its access to jobs. On the positive side, the profession succeeded in obtaining licensing in many states, which in turn often led to the inclusion of social work in reimbursement by private insurance companies and Medicare. A number of public positions in agencies such as child welfare, however, were declassified in the 1970s and 1980s in particular jurisdictions; that is, certain local authorities ceased to specify a social work degree as a qualification for particular kinds of jobs. But a number of public agencies actively recruited trained social workers by the early 1990s in fields such as protective services for abused children, and many positions in the large not- for-profit sector required a social work degree or even a social work license. The inexorable expansion of some social problems and the rise to prominence of others—including AIDS, substance abuse, homelessness, LO 9-15 and Alzheimer’s disease—created new openings for a field whose technologies could easily be adapted to an array of social needs. Perhaps the most controversial issue in the field of social work during this period concerned the role of private practice in the profession. Although most social workers were salaried, many had private practices on the side and aspired to full-time private practice, for its monetary rewards and the autonomy it offered. Critics feared that these private practitioners could draw the profession away from its role as service provider to persons with limited financial means and as an advocate for relatively powerless groups. * Indeed, some private practitioners sought to avoid being called social workers; they preferred to be known, for example, as psychotherapists, though the term clinical social worker was also used. It remained unclear precisely what effects the emergence of private practice would have on the profession. On the one hand, insofar as it represented a retreat from the precepts of social work, from agency practice, and from advocacy for groups with little power, private practice was a threat to the reformist mission of the profession. Private practice, however, did not seem to have fundamentally changed the field by the early 1990s; indeed, it seemed less of a threat to a broad-based mission for the field than psychiatric social work had been in the 1950s, when the profession seemed much more congruent with the conservatism of the era. Nor was it even clear that most persons who aspired to private practice rejected the mission of the profession; more than a few of them simply wished to avoid the stifling work requirements of some social agencies, particularly public ones, where workloads had often become excessive. * Although we cannot use the positions of NASW as the only measure of sentiments within the profession, they suggest that social work had not veered to the right in the 1970s and 1980s. NASW in the 1980s, in its conferences, policy positions, and newsletter, frequently attacked the conservative positions of the Reagan and Bush administrations, assertively sought national health insurance and an array of social reforms, and actively participated in coalitions with advocacy groups such as the Children’s Defense Fund. In 1975, it established a political action arm, the Political Action Committee for Candidate Election (PACE) that backed candidates who supported social reforms. Official policies that NASW’s delegate assembly adopted over a period of 20 years suggest that the field took an array of progressive, even radical, positions on subjects as diverse as AIDS, economic policy, long-term care, and the rights of children. * (Of course, NASW’s positions do not necessarily reflect the positions of rank-and-file social workers.) Nor does the work of social work theorists suggest that the profession veered to the right in the 1980s. Most theorists maintained an ecological perspective that required social workers to examine human functioning in a broad context, including environmental and policy issues. There was an emphasis on diversity —that is, making social work services relevant to a range of oppressed populations, including African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, women, gay men and lesbians, and the poor. Macro practitioners often remained on the fringes in many schools, but they maintained a determined existence and were strongly represented in national conferences of the Council on Social Work Education. * By the same token, social work could hardly be called a radical presence in a society with enormous unmet needs. All professions are influenced by forces that desire to make them more conservative, such as funding from government and business elites, referrals from other professionals, and recruits who are predominantly white and from the middle and upper classes. As Wenocur and Reisch established when discussing its origins, social work is no exception—and Rothman makes a similar point about the profession in the contemporary period. * But social work remained relatively more reformist than other professions such as law, medicine, and business, whose professional associations did not usually take controversial positions on current issues. * Understand the Evolution of the Reluctant Welfare State The presidencies of Reagan and Bush constituted the first major era of conservatism since the 1920s. Their election required a shift in the votes of white Americans, particularly Northern white Catholics and Southern whites in lower and moderate income brackets. Skillfully using rhetoric that fanned the flames of racial animosities and social tensions, Reagan and Bush cultivated these white voters and secured their support in pivotal elections. They appealed, as well, to Americans who wanted political and social stability after such traumas of the 1960s and 1970s as Vietnam, Watergate, and stagflation. Compared with many other nations, the United States developed a welfare state belatedly. Even after the spending increases of the 1960s and 1970s, U.S. government social spending, expressed as a percentage of the gross national product, fell short of that in other industrialized nations, and a host of serious social problems remained unresolved. Just as programs established in the 1960s and 1970s began to address a variety of social needs, the Reagan administration decided to curb their funding. Reagan’s conservative counterrevolution substantially reduced domestic spending, massively increased military spending, and drastically reduced the policy roles of the federal government. Conservatives’ successes were held in check, however, by the many legislators and citizens who did not share their goals and by the Democratic control of the House of Representatives throughout the Reagan and Bush years and of the Senate from 1986 onward. Some historians criticize Reagan’s policies as self-serving and inequitable. Far from cutting all social programs, the administration cut primarily those used by low-income Americans. Tax cuts in 1981 enriched affluent LO 9-16 individuals and corporations far more than other Americans; the tax reform of 1986 drastically reduced the tax rates of affluent Americans. The defense industry reaped unprecedented peacetime profits, even without considering the trillion-dollar SDI initiative. The president, the Justice Department, and the director of the Civil Rights Commission attacked affirmative action policies. By increasing deficit spending, Reagan was asking future generations to fund his defense and tax reduction policies that had created huge deficits. Crippled by international scandals in Iran and Nicaragua in late 1987, and reduced to lame-duck status, Reagan had lost political momentum by the midpoint of his second term. Democrats once again controlled both houses of Congress after the 1986 elections. Although President George H. W. Bush was more responsive to some social problems than Reagan had been, and although his rhetoric was often more diplomatic, his policies were fundamentally the same. Partly because the Democrats had larger majorities in the House and Senate under Bush than under Reagan, Bush had to accept larger spending increases in many social programs. Many persons wondered whether, given budget deficits and a decade of conservative rhetoric, the nation could find the resources and the will to attack entrenched social problems as it moved toward the 21st century. Lack of medical insurance, homelessness, AIDS, growing economic inequality, poor schools, poverty in the racial ghettoes of inner cities, family violence, the feminization of poverty, gang warfare—all of these problems cried out for solutions and creative programs, but burdened human services systems were inadequate to the task. Link the Conservative Counterrevolution to Contemporary Society What W e Can Learn from Policy Advocates of the Conservative Counterrevolution EP 5a Former Congressman and social worker Ron Dellums illustrates how policy advocates must increasingly cross national boundaries in their work. With the remarkable rise of globalization during the past three decades, policy issues in the United States are often linked to social problems and institutions in other nations. See Insert 9.8 . Like many social workers who run for public office, Dellums obtained the credentials needed to run a credible campaign from his work as a social worker, rising from the line- worker position as a psychiatric social worker to administrative and planning positions. When he was ready to run for Congress, he was highly knowledgeable about many domestic social issues. Insert 9.8. Proﬁles in Policy Practice and Advocacy: Ronald V ernie Dellums (1935–) Ronald Vernie Dellums—social worker, politician, civil rights activist, and reformer—was born on November 24, 1935, in Oakland, LO 9-17 California, to Vernie Dellums, a longshoreman, and Willa Dellums, a clerk-typist for the government. As a child growing up in a rough section of Oakland, Dellums dreamed of becoming a major-league pitcher, but he was discouraged by the prejudice of his high school coaches. In 1954, after failing to find work, Dellums enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, where he served for 2 years. Following his discharge, he used his GI Bill benefits and enrolled at Oakland City College, receiving an associate of arts degree in 1958. He went on to receive his B.A. degree from San Francisco State College (1960) and an M.S.W. degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1962. Throughout the 1960s, Dellums held various positions in many areas within public social services. He was a psychiatric social worker for the California Department of Mental Hygiene (1962–1964), program director for the Bayview Community Center in San Francisco (1964– 1965), associate director and subsequently director of the Hunters Point Youth Opportunity Center (1965–1966), planning consultant for the Bay Area Social Planning Council (1966–1967), and director of the concentrated employment program of the San Francisco Economic Opportunity Council (1967–1968). Upon returning to the private sector, Dellums became a senior consultant for manpower programs at Social Dynamics, Inc. In 1967, Dellums launched his political career with a run for the Berkeley City Council. While on the council, Dellums spoke out against what he saw as police brutality against students and minorities, and he assumed the role of liaison between the council and the students on the Berkeley campus. In the 1970 Democratic primary, Dellums, whose political aspirations had broadened during his brief stint on the city council, challenged the reelection of Jeffery Cohelan to the seat representing California’s Seventh Congressional District, the Oakland-Berkeley area. Throughout his campaign, Dellums resisted the pressure to conform to the more conventional approach to politics. He ran as a self-avowed reformist and radical, not afraid to take a solid position on hot issues such as the Vietnam conflict. His sincerity won him the support of a coalition of minorities, students, labor groups, and intellectuals. Dellums won the primary, taking 55% of the votes to Cohelan’s 45%. During the general election, his Republican challenger, John E. Healey, tried to establish a link between Dellums and the activities of the Black Panthers, or what he called the “lunatic left wing.” Dellums also faced attacks by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, who was campaigning on Healey’s behalf. The vice president considered Dellums a “radical extremist,” which was the exact image Ronald V. Dellums hoped to project. Despite his opponent’s attempts to steal his victory, Dellums won the election by a margin of 57% to 41%. After winning, Dellums offered his sincerest appreciation to the man he credited with running his public relations campaign, Spiro T. Agnew. Once in Washington, DC, Dellums concentrated most of his efforts on issues involving the military and civil rights. During his first year in Congress, he was appointed to serve on the Armed Services Committee, the first African American to sit on the committee. In 1971, at his request, Dellums was appointed to the committee that oversees the District of Columbia. He later became the committee’s chairman, and he used his position to fight for and win minimized federal interference in district affairs. Dellums quickly became an outspoken figure on Capitol Hill. In 1971, he introduced resolutions calling for an investigation into war crimes allegedly committed by the U.S. armed forces in Vietnam and raised questions concerning racism in the military. Though the Armed Services Committee ignored his pleas, he organized and conducted his own unofficial hearings, drawing significant national publicity to the concerns he was raising. That same year, Dellums helped organize, and spoke at, an antiwar rally on the steps of the Capitol, at which hundreds of protesters were arrested. A staunch, yet responsible critic of defense spending, Dellums consistently opposed many new major weapons systems and the use of U.S. military force in other countries. Moreover, his criticism of military spending has been evenly dispensed to both Democratic and Republican officials. During the Carter administration, Dellums objected to the president’s plans to develop the MX mobile missile, upgrade the Minuteman III missile, and develop the Trident II submarine-launched missile. During the Reagan era, Dellums denounced the president’s pursuit of a massive defense buildup at the expense of domestic programs. From 1983 to 1989, Dellums, as chairman of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee, monitored expenditures on overseas bases, making sure Reagan did not order them upgraded in preparation for a military exercise in the developing world. It was during the Reagan era that many in Congress began to recognize Dellums’s leadership. In June 1986, Dellums’s influence on Capitol Hill became especially visible. From the beginning of his tenure in Congress, he had called on the United States to severely punish the government of South Africa for its system of apartheid by imposing strict economic sanctions. So committed to the cause to end apartheid in Africa was Dellums that in 1984 he was among a group of demonstrators arrested outside the South African embassy in Washington, DC. For 15 years he spoke out, introduced legislation, and joined in public demonstrations against the inhumane treatment of people in Africa and around the world. In June 1986, the House adopted Dellums’s sanction bill, which barred virtually all trade with and investment in South Africa and suspended commercial air travel between the United States and South Africa. With the exception of the 1992 emergency relief effort undertaken in Somalia, Dellums has opposed every U.S. military intervention abroad since arriving in Washington. He criticized Reagan for sending U.S. troops to invade Grenada (1983), Reagan’s decision to station U.S. marines in Lebanon (1983), Bush’s “Just Cause” invasion of Panama (1989), and the use of force to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait (1991). In October of 1990, Dellums led 83 of his fellow representatives in signing a statement opposing military action in Iraq, and in December of that same year, he and 52 other legislators filed suit in federal court against President Bush, charging the president with acting militarily without congressional consultation or approval. In January 1993, the Democratic Caucus chose Dellums to succeed Les Aspin as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. During his tenure as chairman, Dellums continued to push for cuts in defense spending, which he justified by pointing to the end of the Cold War. In Dellums’s view, reducing defense spending is not an end in itself but a means to convert the U.S. economy from warfare to welfare. Almost from the outset of his congressional tenure, however, Dellums involved himself in international issues. He attacked the Vietnam conflict. He was appointed to the Armed Services Committee. He opposed what he viewed as unneeded weapons systems throughout his career, even when Democrats such as Jimmy Carter supported them. He lambasted President Reagan’s military buildup as excessive. He monitored expenditures on overseas bases in the 1980s. He fought apartheid in South Africa prior to the freeing of Nelson Mandela from jail and got sanctions enacted against that nation. He finally became chair of the House Armed Services Committee in the early 1990s. Dellums recognized that social programs funded by the discretionary budget are threatened by military spending in a way that entitlement programs are not. Since entitlements are automatically funded each year to the level of claimed benefits, they are relatively immune to cuts in annual budget deliberations. By contrast, domestic social programs compete with military spending because both sets of programs are funded by discretionary spending that Congress determines each year in its budget deliberations. Roughly half of the annual federal discretionary budget is still expended on military spending, so each new unneeded military expenditure cuts the pool of resources available for domestic discretionary programs. Dellums’s policy advocacy also illustrates how many policy advocates devote a considerable share of their work to blocking policy initiatives from conservatives. Had Dellums and a large corps of policy advocates not effectively resisted many policy initiatives from President Reagan and his allies, they would have obtained even deeper cuts in many social programs serving vulnerable populations—as well as greater erosion of their rights. Dellums’s successor from the same congressional district, social worker Barbara Lee, has continued his crusade against excessive military spending and strongly opposed the American invasion of Iraq even before the invasion took place in 2003. What W e Can Learn from the Persistence of Unmet Needs and Policy Issues during the Conservative Counterrevolution While the United States has had a homeless population dating back to the 19th century when they were known as “vagabonds,” it greatly grew in size during the presidency of Ronald Reagan for combined economic and policy reasons. Reagan’s quest to cut SSI and Social Security disability payments to persons with mental issues greatly increased the number of persons who were cast onto the streets because they could not afford rents. Afflicted with mental, physical, and substance abuse problems, many Vietnam veterans became homeless persons—particularly as programs to help them from the Veterans’ Administration were insufficiently funded. Increasing levels of poverty in the Reagan administration from cuts in means-tested entitlements such as AFDC also contributed to homelessness. The Reagan administration also slashed funding of federal Section 8 housing and other programs geared to producing affordable housing. Deep cuts in AFDC cast some single mothers and their children on the streets. The shift from a skid row homeless population composed primarily of males with substance abuse problems to a much larger and broader population represented a long-term social problem as successive administrations failed to frontally address it—even to the present period. What W e Can Learn from Failed Policy Strategies of the Conservative Counterrevolution President Reagan and his allies subscribed to supply-side or “trickle-down” economic theory, which maintains that disproportionate tax cuts for wealthy persons will ultimately propel everyone toward greater prosperity. Compared with the 1960s and 1970s, however, economic inequality greatly increased in the 1980s—and the number of persons falling beneath federal poverty levels also increased. Subscribing to Reagan’s economic philosophy, President George W. Bush, too, cut federal taxes by trillions of dollars with affluent persons also receiving disproportionate cuts as did President Donald Trump. As in the 1980s, economic inequality increased, as did the numbers of persons under official poverty lines. The argument that economic growth can only take place if affluent persons pay relatively low levels of taxes has been refuted by history. During the 1960s and 1990s, economic growth was relatively robust and affluent persons paid relatively high rates of taxes as compared to the 1980s—with top marginal rates exceeding 70% as compared to less than 40% or much lower. Conversely, during the first decade of the 21st century, taxes, as well as economic growth, fell. Moreover, supply-side economic theory has been refuted by relatively high rates of economic growth in Europe, where tax rates on affluent persons have been far higher than in the United States. In the case of European societies, far fewer persons live in poverty than in the United States—and these nations possess far lower rates of economic inequality. What W e Can Learn from Promising Strategies of the Conservative Counterrevolution Americans should not be able to have it both ways: using the labor of millions of undocumented immigrants while also denying them basic human rights. (Americans also benefit from the payroll and other taxes that these immigrants pay even as they receive only emergency health care.) When a bipartisan coalition enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, they cut through this American hypocrisy by granting amnesty to roughly 3 million immigrants who could prove that they had worked in the United States for 4 or more years. Yet this legislation did not provide a lasting solution to this issue. By 2017, roughly 12 million additional immigrants resided in the United States who lacked official documents or who possessed only temporary visas. Once again, American corporations and employers used their labor—often contending that they could not locate American citizens to fill these positions. But this legislation was stymied in 2007 though it had bipartisan support—and was stymied by Republican opposition in the presidencies of Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Once again, the United States denied these productive persons basic benefits and rights—often paying them at levels beneath the federal minimum wage, not enforcing work safety standards, subjecting them to police harassment, and dividing families by deporting parents of children. To their credit, many federal legislators, as well as President George W. Bush, urgently sought to enact immigration legislation that would give some of these immigrants amnesty, while providing more rights and benefits to the remaining immigrants with temporary visas. But this legislation was stymied in 2007 even though it had bipartisan support. Some of the features of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, spearheaded by Republican Ronald Reagan, must again be enacted to help the nation cope with its immigration issues. What We Can Learn from the Conservative Counterrevolution about the Structure of the American W elfare State A significant shift in the structure of the American welfare state took place in the 1980s with the enactment of block grants that gave states far greater policy roles in scores of programs that were placed in them. If states had become relatively weak participants in the American welfare state with the enactment of many federal entitlement programs, as well as categorical programs, states now became central players. States developed large bureaucracies to administer these programs even as much of their funding continued to come from the federal government. Devolution of policy responsibilities was substantial in the 1980s—and supported not only by conservatives in Washington, DC, but also by state officials from both parties who wanted to become more powerful partners in the American welfare state. The lesson is clear to social workers, whether in their roles in micro, mezzo, or macro policy advocacy. They cannot be effective in their work if they do not fully understand the operations of their state governments, including their central agencies and their websites. Indeed, state agencies, legislatures, and governors have become as important to the welfare state as their federal counterparts—and far more powerful than local governments.

The Period of Gridlock and Extreme Inequality Introduction Gridlock between the two major parties dominated the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George Bush, Jr., and Barack Obama, as well as the first eleven months of Donald Trump in 2017. The gridlock pitted the two major parties against one another as Democrats became more liberal and Republicans became more conservative during these four presidencies than during the 1960s and 1970s. Even Ronald Reagan, an arch conservative, developed some bipartisan agreements and legislation about the budget, immigrants, and Social Security. The movement to the left and the right by the two parties was partly caused by gerrymandering of election districts into ones that were mostly population by Republican or Democratic majorities. Democrats and Republicans lived in their respective “bubbles” that came to include mass media that catered to them. Rural Americans and blue-collar whites gradually moved toward the Republican Party while urban voters, some suburban voters, women, persons of color, moved toward the Democratic Party during this period. Gridlocked Congresses produced relatively little social legislation during these presidencies as compared to Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. Gridlocked Congresses produced endless budget and tax battles between the parties. Presidents and Congresses made little progress in addressing the nation’s extreme economic inequality that rivaled inequality in the Gilded Age of the 1880s. Inequality contributed, in turn, to poverty, poor health, homelessness, foreclosures, poor educational performance, high infant morality, low rates of social mobility, and low life expectancy.

In his 1992 campaign, Clinton ran on a relatively liberal agenda that featured increased spending on a range of social programs, as well as health and welfare reform. Clinton was able to enact some social reforms in his first 2 years in office and to avoid deep cuts in many social programs, but he was placed on the defensive in 1995 after Republicans under the leadership of Newt Gingrich swept the congressional elections and gained control of both houses of Congress. Republicans proceeded to advance a conservative agenda based on cutting taxes, slashing social spending, ending entitlements, and devolving many federal policy roles to the states. A titanic confrontation ensued between the Democratic administration and the Republican Congress. The central issues were the size and priorities of the national budget in 1995 and the nation’s commitment to entitlements such as AFDC and Medicaid. Yet Clinton made a remarkable comeback, winning reelection in 1996 and obtaining many small victories in his second term despite Republicans’ control of both houses of Congress. 1998 Clinton foresees an extended period of budget surpluses Discuss the Ascendancy of Bill Clinton EP 7a Like Lyndon Johnson, Clinton was preoccupied with obtaining power; he sought it directly and he made connections for himself by participating in other people’s campaigns. In his youth, he won class presidencies in high school and at Georgetown University. Using his contacts with Senator William Fulbright, he obtained a clerkship with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee while a college student and thus learned the inner workings of the Senate. By deft maneuvering he obtained a Rhodes scholarship, which allowed him to study at Oxford University for 2 years before obtaining a law degree at Yale. Even before he returned to Arkansas in 1973, at the age of 27, he had participated in four major campaigns at state and federal levels, culminating in the ill-fated presidential campaign of George McGovern in 1972. Throughout all of these experiences, Clinton developed thousands of contacts that he meticulously filed on index cards—contacts that he later cultivated and freely used to obtain funds, support, and advice for his own political races. Undeterred by a losing run for the House of Representatives from a rural part of Arkansas in 1974, he was elected attorney general in 1976 and governor in 1978; that victory made him the youngest governor in the United States in four decades. Aside from a single loss in 1980, he held the governorship for four terms; in 1991, during his fifth term, he decided to run for president. His wife, Hillary, profoundly shaped his political career as his closest advisor in Arkansas and during his presidency. LO 10-1 The Search for the Real Bill Clinton From the beginning of his career, Clinton has left many people uncertain where he really stood. * He supported liberal policies on some occasions and moderate or conservative policies on others. He frequently retreated from liberal positions, to the dismay of liberal supporters, only to subsequently return to them. * His inconsistency stemmed from several sources. As a Southern politician, he had to present a moderate or conservative profile to succeed in a rural state that had supported politicians such as Orval Faubus, the governor who defied federal school desegregation orders in the 1950s. Like many Southern politicians, including Jimmy Carter and ex-Senator Sam Nunn, Clinton feared that the Southern Democratic Party might not survive Southern Republicans’ attempts to win over white voters by means of antitax, antispending, and conservative rhetoric. * However, Clinton had strong social reform and populist convictions. As a child, Clinton had been repulsed by the racist policies of Orval Faubus, as well as the segregationist policies of the South. John Kennedy was his personal hero. Partly because he opposed the Vietnam War but also because he possessed liberal views, Clinton campaigned for George McGovern in 1972. As a populist or social reformer, Clinton sought reforms in the educational system of Arkansas, tried to lower utility rates, participated in a lawsuit against physicians who refused to serve Medicaid patients, and favored job training for welfare recipients. Although he did not support civil rights legislation in Arkansas, he appointed many African Americans and women to government posts. He favored major tax increases in Arkansas to fund road construction and improvements in public education. * Intensely ambitious and determined to win elections in his Southern state, Clinton was a chameleon even before he became president. He viewed himself as a social reformer and felt most comfortable when championing social causes and attacking vested interests. However, when attacked by Southern opponents as a tax-and-spend Democrat, Clinton would backtrack if he believed his political base was jeopardized. He would repudiate former allies, such as organized labor or school teachers; seek tougher work requirements for welfare recipients; fail to seek civil rights legislation; or demand that the national Democratic Party become more moderate. Clinton’s political style contributed to fears that he lacked deep convictions. From 1980 onward, he relied heavily on Dick Morris, a political consultant who placed extraordinary reliance on political polls. Under Morris’s tutelage, Clinton shaped his rhetoric and positions almost daily in response to the most recent poll results. Morris preached that politicians should couple pragmatism with idealism, in a kind of permanent campaign. * Observers began to wonder if Clinton possessed any core values. They worried that he was overly eager to be liked by everyone and unable to take strong, confrontational positions, even when pitted against conservatives. Some saw him as too academic, a policy wonk who mulled over endless options without reaching closure. The Search for the New Democrat Clinton’s ill-defined views and Southern origins would have made his ascension to the presidency difficult in the 1960s, when Northern, liberal Democrats possessed considerable power in the national party. But by the early 1990s, these characteristics became assets rather than liabilities, for several reasons. With the extraordinary movement of people from the North to the Sun Belt from the 1950s through the 1980s, the electoral votes of the South and of California exceeded those of the Northern industrial states. The power of suburban voters had steadily increased since the 1960s, as well, to the point that a majority of voters in the 1992 presidential elections were suburbanites. Increasingly, Democratic leaders came to fear that, if they were to concede the South and Northern suburbs to Republicans, they might become a minority party for decades. Moreover, the ultraliberal McGovern’s one-sided defeat in 1972 led many Democrats to worry that the party was positioning itself so far to the left that it would no longer appeal to the white ethnic voters who had been a bastion of Democratic support since the 1930s. This threat had become more ominous by the 1980s, when substantial numbers of Republicans replaced Democrats in Congress. In an equally disturbing trend, some Democratic officeholders, such as Phil Gramm of Texas, had switched parties. In the wake of McGovern’s defeat, Democrats like Ben Wattenberg sought to move the party back to the center; they feared that special interest groups such as feminists, civil rights groups, and organized labor had captured it. These Democrats were particularly opposed to affirmative action, liberal welfare programs, and the eclipse of the states’ policy roles. * Clinton signaled his decision to identify with the moderate wing of the party in 1980 by strongly supporting Jimmy Carter, a fellow Southern governor, against Teddy Kennedy’s bid for the presidential nomination. In 1985, he helped found the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), which sought to define a third way—that is, a political platform that fell between traditional liberal and conservative positions. If traditional Democrats had favored redistribution of resources to the poor, civil rights legislation, affirmative action, and cuts in defense spending, the new Democrats emphasized a narrower range of economic reforms—job training, national standards in education, free trade, and infrastructure improvements. If traditional Democrats favored new spending on social programs and retention of existing spending, the new Democrats favored balanced budgets. If traditional Democrats were opposed to free trade, partly because trade unions feared it might hurt their domestic markets, new Democrats (with some exceptions) liked it; they believed that free trade would eventually expand markets for American goods by forcing efficiencies in American industry and lowering other nations’ trade barriers. If traditional Democrats wanted large cuts in the military in the wake of the Cold War, new Democrats favored only selective cuts. New Democrats were determined, as well, to challenge conservatives’ charges that Democrats were soft on welfare and crime. If traditional Democrats had often championed higher welfare benefits, new Democrats emphasized work requirements and limits on benefits. They often favored stiffer penalties for various crimes such as drug dealing, as well as extension of the death penalty to new crimes. If traditional Democrats discussed the obligations of citizens to help others, new Democrats emphasized the responsibilities of citizens—for example, to seek work, raise families, and help their communities (see Insert 10.1 ).

Perhaps most important, the new Democrats emphasized the economic needs of the middle class rather than low-income groups or racial out- groups, partly because they attributed the Republicans’ upsurge in the 1980s to the alienation of white voters who perceived the Democrats as beholden to feminists, civil rights activists, and gays. Believing that this alienation was partly due to the erosion of living standards for many working-class and middle-class Americans, new Democrats often advocated education, job training, and tax cuts that would help this group rather than emphasizing programs to help poor inner-city residents and other outgroups. * However, these new Democrats did not dominate the party in the early 1990s. Liberal Democrats maintained a strong presence in party councils, as did activists from an array of civil rights, feminist, and labor groups. Party chieftains in Congress, such as House Speaker Tom Foley and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, did not belong to the Democratic Leadership Council, even if they also feared the desertion of many white voters to the Republican cause. Bill Clinton’s ill-defined views positioned him perfectly to obtain the allegiance of the divided Democratic Party, if he could convince both factions that he favored their positions. He appealed to those Democrats who believed a Southern candidate was needed to avert further Republican inroads in the Sun Belt—and could point to his election as chair of the DLC in 1990 as proof that he could appeal to Democratic moderates and conservatives. Having campaigned for McGovern and sought various reforms in Arkansas, he often spoke like a traditional Democrat. As a Baptist, he often spoke in African American churches and gave Vernon Jordan, a prominent African American attorney, important roles in his campaign and presidency. His wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had chaired the board of directors of the Children’s Defense Fund, broadened his appeal to liberals. As an outsider who had never been elected to federal office, Clinton could also attract widespread support from independents and those citizens who were deeply cynical about the federal government and about Congress. Many good reasons existed for cynicism. Americans had heard endless promises from politicians that budgets would be balanced since 1981, only to find mounting deficits. They had seen many news reports about government waste in both defense and domestic agencies. They knew that politicians who could obtain huge contributions from special interests and wealthy people bought many elections. Finally, the bitter wrangling between Republican presidents and the Democratic Congress during the Reagan and G. H. W. Bush years, punctuated by presidential vetoes, had fueled widespread frustration at government gridlock. Review the Presidential Campaign of 1992 EP 5c Most Democrats regarded George H. W. Bush as unbeatable in the fall of 1991, in the wake of Operation Desert Storm, a highly popular war against Iraq. Facing candidates with little name recognition or uncertain reputations, like Paul Tsongas, John Kerry, and Jerry Brown, Clinton relied on his superior campaign skills, his adeptness at using the mass media, his vast network of contacts, and his ability to raise money to easily win the Democratic nomination in July of 1992. Clinton’s road to the presidency was complicated by the third-party candidacy of Ross Perot, a maverick billionaire from Texas. Drawing on widespread cynicism about politicians and the government, Perot vowed to clean up Washington. Perot was vague about his likely policies, with one notable exception: He vowed to end the budget deficit soon after taking office, though he did not explain precisely how he would do so. By focusing on the budget deficit, Perot elevated that issue in the public’s consciousness and stimulated other candidates to address it. Fearful that Perot would draw votes from them, both Bush and Clinton emphasized deficit reduction in their own campaigns; Clinton promised to halve the deficit within 4 years, from $237 billion to $118 billion. Clinton fashioned a clever strategy in this complex environment. He maintained the allegiance of liberals by supporting the policy recommendations of Robert Reich, a professor Clinton knew from Oxford University and Yale Law School. Reich believed that the economy no LO 10-2 longer revolved around nation-states but had become globalized as corporations dispersed their operations in many nations in search of cheap labor (for unskilled jobs) or educated, technologically sophisticated labor (for skilled jobs). In this globalized economy, Reich contended, the American workforce was polarizing into two factions. Symbolic analysts, who had higher degrees and were adept at information age technologies, had expanding options in an array of highly paid professional, technical, and corporate positions. By contrast, with the sharp decline in well-paid, unionized industrial jobs since the 1960s, tens of millions of Americans worked in low-paid, unskilled jobs. These low-paid workers in clerical, sales, and fast-food jobs faced a bleak economic future: Reich predicted that corporations would continue to place their manufacturing operations in low-wage nations, such as Mexico and Thailand, and in consequence, the wages and economic security of unskilled American workers would deteriorate even further. Concluding that the nation could retain and develop better-paying jobs only if it invested in its human capital and its infrastructure, such as roads and telecommunications, Reich recommended large expenditures in education, job training, and public improvements. * In addition to these social investment expenditures, which required outlays over many years, Clinton also advocated immediate spending—so-called stimulus spending—on an array of public projects to invigorate the stagnant economy. Clinton also promised to reform the health care system. He had long been concerned about the plight of Americans who lacked health coverage; as governor of Arkansas, he sought to develop public health, maternal health, and family-planning services in the state. In 1991, when Democrat Harrison Wofford ran a successful senatorial campaign in Pennsylvania on a health reform platform, Clinton became convinced that public opinion favored an overhaul of the American health system. To strengthen his liberal credentials, he advocated unpaid leaves to allow employees to care for babies or ailing relatives, and he vowed to overturn the ban on gay men and lesbians in the military. He solicited support from environmentalists by selecting as his vice president Senator Albert Gore, Jr., who had supported many environmental causes. He cemented the support of liberal Democrats by promising to increase taxes on affluent Americans, who had, he argued, enriched themselves throughout the 1980s as a result of the Reagan administration’s tax cuts. Intent on capturing moderate and conservative votes and on securing the support of white ethnic voters, Clinton also used campaign language that the Democratic Leadership Council favored. Words like “responsibility,” “community,” and “opportunity” and glowing references to the middle class were scattered throughout his speeches. He promised to enact welfare reform that coupled strong work requirements with liberal subsidies for childcare and job training. In a widely publicized statement, he criticized Sister Souljah, an African American rap singer, for militant language; an accusation that brought a public confrontation with Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, who accused Clinton of currying the favor of white citizens. Clinton promised a significant tax cut for middle-class Americans, even though he had received confidential information that the federal deficit would be far higher than the Bush administration had publicly admitted. To neutralize Ross Perot, Clinton promised that he would support campaign reforms, consider some cuts in entitlements, and halve the nation’s deficit during his term. Most important, Clinton understood that presidential races often hinge on the state of the economy. To Clinton’s astonishment, Bush failed to emphasize a strategy for reinvigorating the economy and thus alienated many of the working- and middle-class voters who had defected to the Republican Party from the Democratic Party in the 1980s. Lacking a focus for his campaign in its early stages, Clinton’s strategists successfully guided its later stages on the basis of a motto posted prominently in their campaign headquarters: “It’s the economy, stupid.” Clinton won the election, but by the narrowest margin since 1968. He obtained only 43% of the popular vote, as compared with 38% for Bush and 19% for Perot. Clinton’s support in California, industrial states of the Midwest, and New York State carried him to victory. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress; however, their margin in the Senate was insufficient to stop a Republican filibuster, and their majority in the House would be destroyed if only 30 conservative Democrats voted with the Republicans. Thus, in both the House and the Senate, Clinton would be vulnerable to a coalition of Southern (or border state) Democrats and Republicans if they viewed his policies as excessively liberal. Clinton’ s Grim Options Even before his inauguration, Clinton knew that his first challenge would be to fashion a budget and an economic policy. Perot’s single-minded focus upon the budget deficit during the campaign had forced the issue to center stage. Were Clinton not to devise policies to reduce the deficit markedly, he would be accused of abandoning his campaign promise to halve it within 4 years—and would face a rebellious Congress, where many newly elected legislators were determined to diminish it. Clinton’s dilemma was that he had proposed contradictory policies during the campaign: He had promised to halve the nation’s deficit, but he had also promised to fund social investments and provide an immediate economic stimulus. Moreover, he had promised a tax cut for middle-class citizens and had downplayed the need for tax increases. To further complicate his deficit-reducing task, Clinton had rarely discussed spending cuts during the campaign; he had promised only to end subsidies to beekeepers and to consider modest premium increases for wealthy Medicare recipients. With his advisors and cabinet named, Clinton came face to face with daunting economic realities that would further frustrate deficit reduction. While he had learned in August that the Bush administration would soon issue a higher estimate of the budget deficit, he had not focused on these figures. Bush came to estimate the deficit for 1997 at $305 billion, or $68 billion higher than he had predicted in the summer. (Many Democrats, including Clinton, feared it would rise to $360 billion or more.) With soaring Medicare and Medicaid costs, deficits would again begin to rise after 1997, even if a strong antideficit program were implemented in the interim. These economic realities meant that Clinton had to seriously consider two options that were certain to attract political opposition: increasing taxes and cutting spending on existing programs. * Obstacles to tax increases had been introduced by Reagan, who had developed wide support for tax cuts, and by G. H. W. Bush, who had been vilified for breaking his promise to the 1988 Republican convention: “Read my lips. No new taxes.” Nor were spending cuts palatable to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, which was anxious to enact a large agenda of social reforms after 12 years of Republican presidents. Clinton also encountered another reality that would profoundly influence his economic strategy. During the campaign, he had emphasized spending increases as the primary means of stimulating the economy—a traditional Democratic method of restoring economic growth. Soon after he was elected, however, he met with Alan Greenspan, the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board. Greenspan contended that economic growth would hinge not on stimulus spending but on interest rates charged to borrowers, such as home buyers, consumers, and corporations. Were interest rates to rise, these borrowers would have to pay more for their loans and would thus be discouraged from expenditures and investments. The best route to economic growth, Greenspan asserted, was to cut the large deficit. If the deficit were lower, he argued, interest rates would fall because fewer investment funds would be diverted from the private sector to the purchase of government bonds. It became clear to Clinton, as well, that bond traders on Wall Street possessed extraordinary power over the economy, through their trading actions; they would sell and buy bonds at lower interest rates only if they believed that the government was pursuing antideficit policies—for example, by cutting social spending. Greenspan implied, moreover, that he and the Federal Reserve Board would cut the so-called prime rate, which powerfully influences interest rates of banks, but they would do so only if the Clinton administration developed a credible deficit reduction plan. (At various points subsequently, Clinton felt that Greenspan and Wall Street bond traders controlled his policies; he feared that they might increase interest rates if he failed to emphasize deficit reduction over spending increases. * ) Before tackling his budget dilemma, Clinton devoted the month of December to selecting his cabinet and his economic team. His choices signified that he wanted an array of perspectives in his administration. On the conservative side, he chose advisors likely to emphasize deficit reduction—Senator Lloyd Bentsen as Secretary of the Treasury, Wall Street banker Robert Rubin to head his economic team, and deficit hawks Representative Leon Panetta and Alice Rivlin to run the Office of Management and Budget. He named the relatively liberal Laura D’Andrea Tyson to chair the Council of Economic Advisors. He also gave key posts to other liberal advisors—Robert Reich as Secretary of Labor, Donna Shalala as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Henry Cisneros as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The liberal emphasis of his first 2 years was accentuated, moreover, by his decision to grant his wife, Hillary, a large role in overseeing domestic policy and by his frequent consultations with campaign strategists James Carville, Paul Begala, Stan Greenberg, and Mandy Grunwald, who insisted that Clinton follow through on his campaign promises to increase social investments. From Social Investment to Deﬁcit Reduction Even before his inauguration, Clinton was drawn in different directions by an array of powerful forces and people. Strong pressure for deficit reduction came from Bentsen and Rubin, who were convinced by Greenspan’s logic. Members of Congress from both parties—particularly those newly elected —believed the people favored deficit reduction. He knew, as well, that the Republicans would make deficit reduction a central theme in their political strategy in 1993; they were eager to continue their attack on him as a tax- and-spend Democrat. On the other hand, many people tried to convince Clinton not to abandon his campaign promises of social investments, health reform, and welfare reform. Liberal Democrats hadn’t controlled the presidency for 12 years, and they had seen many social programs severely cut during this period. They urged Clinton to pursue social investments and stimulus spending, as did many interest groups, such as the Children’s Defense Fund and the American Association of Retired Persons. The strongest advocates for social investments within the administration were campaign strategists like Carville, Begala, and Grunwald, sometimes joined by Reich, Tyson, and Hillary Clinton. Nor should we minimize Clinton’s own social reform proclivities; he deeply believed that social investments were needed to help working Americans improve their economic options. In behind-the-scenes meetings during the first months of his administration, he frequently expressed reluctance to break his campaign promises. * With the Democrats in control of Congress, he had considerable political leverage to enact social reforms and to fund a liberal agenda. Developing an Economic Package Presidents who come into office for the first time inherit their predecessor’s budget, even though they may modify it. George H. W. Bush’s budget emphasized cuts in social spending—including spending caps on many entitlement programs—and no new taxes, and thus pressured Clinton to follow suit in his own economic plans. Not content merely to adopt Bush’s budget, which did not reflect his interest in social investments, Clinton decided to develop his own economic package—a set of targets for spending, taxes, and deficit reduction that he wanted the Democratic Congress to incorporate in its Budget Resolution in the spring. (He planned to give the Congress his own detailed budget later in the spring to show how he would meet the targets that he proposed.) In the course of many meetings with his top advisors, Clinton made several key decisions. He decided to backtrack from his campaign promise to halve the deficit by 1996; instead, he proposed to reduce it to just $205 billion in 1997. Even to reach this figure, he would need new tax revenues, particularly if he wanted immediate stimulus spending of $30 billion and social investments of $230 billion over 5 years. So he decided to include a broad-based energy tax based on heat output (expressed in British thermal units, or BTUs), and he also proposed to make permanent a 2.5-cents-per- gallon addition to the federal gas tax that had been scheduled to expire in 1995. He announced major tax increases for wealthy Americans; the new top rate would be 36% for couples earning more than $140,000 and individuals earning more than $115,000. Altogether, his tax increases totaled $328 billion over 5 years. He combined these tax increases with spending cuts of $375 billion over 5 years; among other things, he proposed to eliminate 100,000 positions from the federal government, to slow the rate of increase in fees paid to providers under Medicare, to extend a Medicare premium increase that was due to expire, and to cut defense modestly. Clinton “blinked” with respect to military spending, deciding to make virtually no cuts in military spending partly because Bush, Sr. had made his alleged evasion of the draft during the Vietnam War a campaign issue in 1992.In effect, Clinton forged a compromise between his liberal and his conservative advisors that included both spending increases and deficit reduction. He announced his economic package on February 17. In his speeches, moreover, he emphasized deficit reduction rather than social investments. * Analyze the Budget Process To understand the fate of Clinton’s social investments—and the continuing conflict between Republicans, Democrats, and the president—we must first comprehend the budget process, which dominated the nation’s politics in 1993, 1995, and much of 1996. An examination of this process will give us important insights into the reasons why many social programs, such as childcare, child welfare, and mental health services, have been chronically underfunded even into the presidency of Donald Trump in 2017 and 2018. The budget process begins when the president submits his proposed budget for the coming fiscal year, typically in February. He outlines how much money he wants to allocate to each program in the coming year, whether he wants new taxes, his estimate of the likely budget deficit, and his estimate of the likely effects of his budget on the budget deficit. Federal spending can be placed in two categories: entitlements and discretionary spending. Programs such as AFDC, Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, and Food Stamps are entitlements ; the statutes that establish the programs lay out standards that recipients must meet, and the government automatically grants funds to pay the benefits of all recipients who meet those standards in a given year. Interest on the national debt, incurred by the sale of bonds to investors to fund annual budget deficit, must be funded each year. Unlike entitlements and interest on the national debt, the funds for discretionary programs are determined annually by votes of the appropriations committees in each chamber. The Congress might decide in a given year, for example, to cut funding of a child nutrition program or to increase funding of a public health program. In Clinton’s budget proposal for the 1994 fiscal year ( Figure 10.1 ), expenditures were divided among entitlements and mandatory spending (roughly 50% of the budget), discretionary spending (roughly 33% of the budget), and interest on the national debt (roughly one-sixth of the budget). LO 10-3 Inspection of Figure 10.1 reveals that the discretionary spending in Clinton’s budget included approximately equal components of domestic and military spending. Only $68.1 billion (or about 4% of the entire federal budget) is devoted to the combined discretionary programs of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor, which constitute (aside from entitlements) the heart of the American welfare state. * Figure 10.1. Details SOURCE : President’s budget. Office of Management and Budget, Appropriations Committee. An overview of the president’s proposed budget for fiscal year 1994. Four facets of this federal budget are of particular interest to social workers: 1. Funding of entitlements . Cuts in expenditures on entitlements have a severe impact on social workers’ clients, who often depend on Medicare, Medicaid, AFDC, SSI, and Food Stamps. 2. Domestic discretionary spending . This section of the budget, which accounts for only about 16% of the total, funds social programs related to mental health, child welfare, substance abuse, public health, AIDS treatment/prevention, homelessness, child care, and many other areas. 3. Tax policy . Tax cuts decrease the revenues needed to fund entitlements and domestic discretionary spending. Moreover, when taxes are cut excessively, budget deficits increase, and concern about budget deficits and the national debt often leads legislators to cut social programs. 4. Military spending . Military programs compete with domestic programs for discretionary funds. Indeed, more than one-half of discretionary funds is devoted to military spending. After the president has submitted his budget, Congress takes center stage. After reviewing the president’s budget, a Budget Committee of each chamber puts together a Budget Resolution, a document that establishes spending goals for each entitlement program; develops spending goals for discretionary spending in 13 areas, including domestic and military programs; outlines tax revenue targets for the coming fiscal year; and sets a target for the overall size of the budget deficit (or surplus). When the Budget Committees want to reduce the budget deficit, as was the case in 1993 and 1995, their Budget Resolutions mandate spending cuts or tax increases or some combination of both. (If a Budget Committee chooses to reduce taxes, as both Republicans in Congress and President Clinton proposed in 1995, its Budget Resolution must mandate even deeper spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit.) Each chamber must vote on the Budget Resolution that its Budget Committee has fashioned. Once approved, these two documents are sent to a conference committee that includes members from each chamber. That committee negotiates a compromise Budget Resolution, which must then be ratified by both chambers. The resulting Congressional Budget Resolution instructs the committees of Congress to develop legislation and appropriations bills that conform to its directives. Rather than telling Congress specifically how to reach the spending, tax, and budget reduction goals, the Budget Resolution merely instructs particular congressional committees to increase or decrease spending by stipulated amounts. It might want, say, $3 billion in cuts in Medicare over 5 years; congressional committees then face the task of deciding how to achieve these savings by changing the Medicare statutes. The Budget Resolution in 1993 instructed the House Committee on Education and Labor, for example, to make changes in laws within its jurisdiction to allow increases in outlays of $118 million in the coming budget year and reductions in outlays in the succeeding 3 years totaling nearly $6 billion. To make laws conform to these directives, the House Committee on Education and Labor has to change eligibility and benefit levels of many programs in its jurisdiction, and the House Appropriations Committee, which recommends what funds will actually be spent in a given year, has to implement these funding guidelines in its spending recommendations. Similarly, the Budget Resolution instructs committees that deal with tax legislation to raise (or lower) tax revenues by specific amounts. To meet the targets of the Budget Resolution, then, the Congress must implement two parallel tracks. One track deals with entitlements and tax legislation. In this track, the spending goals of the Budget Resolution are met by changing those statutes that govern specific programs and tax policy. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee assume pivotal roles here because they process most tax legislation, as well as entitlements like Medicare, Medicaid, and AFDC. To obtain cuts in the Medicare program recommended by the Budget Resolution, the House Ways and Means Committee might consider raising premiums for elderly persons using Part B (physician services), cutting coverage of certain services (such as mental health services), or lowering reimbursement fees for doctors and hospitals. The other track consists of legislative committees (such as the House Committee on Education and Labor) and appropriations committees (such as the House Appropriations Committee) that deal with domestic discretionary programs. As the House Ways and Means Committee is amending tax laws and entitlement statutes that govern programs such as Medicaid, other House committees are working to fashion spending (or appropriations) recommendations for programs such as Head Start that are funded by the discretionary budget. Two kinds of recommendations emerge from the Congress. First, each chamber often bundles its entitlement and tax recommendations into a reconciliation bill , so called because its recommendations reconcile tax and entitlement policies with the spending and tax guidelines of the Budget Resolution. Each chamber must vote on its reconciliation bill; a conference committee then develops a compromise version that must be ratified by each chamber. Second, to specify discretionary spending, each chamber develops 13 separate appropriations bills , including one that focuses on programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor. These bills conform to guidelines in the Budget Resolution. As with each chamber’s reconciliation bill, conference committees fashion compromise appropriations measures that must be ratified by each chamber. By late summer or fall, attention shifts back to the president, who has to decide whether to sign or veto the congressional recommendations from both tracks. If he signs the reconciliation bills and the 13 appropriation bills, the budget is set for the coming year. If he vetoes any of these bills, the president and Congress must agree on a continuing resolution that temporarily funds federal programs. With the continuing resolution in place, Congress attempts to fashion modifications of the vetoed bills that the president is willing to sign. (If Congress and the president cannot agree on a continuing resolution, some government programs may come to a temporary halt; as we shall see, this occurred during the turbulent budget impasse of 1995 and 1996.) Assess the Demise of the Stimulus Package Recall that, in his economic package, Clinton proposed two kinds of new spending: an immediate economic stimulus to get the economy moving and social investments. House leaders introduced his $30 billion stimulus package in mid-February. (Only $16.3 billion was new spending; the rest consisted of business tax incentives and construction loans.) The stimulus spending was vulnerable on several counts. Because this spending was relatively small, it would not have a large economic effect even if enacted. Moreover, unlike the social investments, which were guided by Robert Reich’s philosophy of making the nation competitive in a global economy, the stimulus package contained a lot of pork—that is, expenditures for various projects in the districts of important Democrats, such as road construction grants to particular cities. Conservatives were certain to attack it as inconsistent with deficit reduction. Clinton moved to get immediate action on his stimulus package. The Republicans, urged forward by deficit hawks like Newt Gingrich and John Kasich, opposed it en masse and tried to portray the new president as a big spender. But the response of many House Democrats, particularly moderates and conservatives, was even more disconcerting. They wanted to cast their deficit reduction vote before casting their vote for stimulus spending so that they could tell their constituents that they prioritized spending cuts. Consequently, they insisted that the vote on the stimulus package be delayed until the Budget Resolution, which emphasized deficit reduction, was also ready for a vote in the House. After heavy lobbying by Clinton, the House did pass the stimulus package. But it was then subjected to devastating opposition from moderate and conservative Democrats in the Senate. Senators David Boren and John Breaux, who had been saying for weeks that Congress should make actual spending cuts before approving the stimulus package, wanted to spend only LO 10-4 half of the stimulus package and to delay approval of the rest of it until Congress enacted those tax increases and spending cuts detailed in the House Budget Resolution. Strong-arm parliamentary tactics by Senator Robert Byrd, the Senate Majority Leader, angered Republican senators by making it impossible for them to amend the legislation. Realizing that they lacked the votes to stop it, Republicans decided to filibuster. When the Senate recessed and legislators returned to their districts to get constituents’ feedback, Clinton received another bad piece of news; many voters told their representatives that they prioritized deficit reduction over stimulus spending. When Clinton offered to cut the stimulus bill by one-fourth, to only $12.2 billion, Republicans insisted that all spending in the legislation be deleted, except for a $4 billion provision to fund extensions of unemployment insurance. Unable to stop the filibuster otherwise, the Democrats conceded on April 21. The stimulus package was finally passed but with most its resources deleted. * The Gutting of Social Investments If stimulus spending was gutted, what happened to the social investments in Clinton’s economic package? Early warning signs suggested that Clinton’s social investments would not emerge unscathed during the appropriations process due to conservatives’ strong dislike of spending increases and due to tax cuts in the House and, even more, in the Senate. Some Democrats also prioritized cutting deficits over funding social investments. But they particularly wanted cuts in social investments to cut Clinton’s proposed deficits. Long story made short, the social investments were cut from his proposed $230 billion over five years to a mere $10 billion over five years. Opposition came not only from Republican conservatives, but some Democrats who prioritized deficit reduction.

Write them down and see if you were correct when you read about their presidencies in the next chapter Discuss the Fight for Health Reform EP 5c Long before the presidential campaign of 1992, Clinton realized that the American health care system had many flaws. Unlike most other industrialized nations, the United States had developed a health care system that revolved around employers and private insurance companies. Many employers paid, in part or in full, the monthly premiums on private health insurance policies for employees and their families. This system often worked well for those who were covered by it, but others lacked coverage because they were unemployed, because their employers chose not to offer health insurance, or because chronic or catastrophic conditions had exhausted their benefits. Moreover, individuals beginning a new job might be denied coverage if the employer’s health insurance company determined that they had a preexisting health condition. The enactment of Medicare and Medicaid had provided government-funded benefits to citizens over age 65 (Medicare) and to low-income persons who lacked private health insurance and met income eligibility standards (Medicaid). Even with these programs, about 40 million Americans lacked private health insurance or access to Medicare and Medicaid in 1992. The American health care system was also extraordinarily costly, absorbing about 15% of the gross national product (GNP) in 1992, as compared with less than 10% in other industrialized nations. Costs were increasing at such an extraordinary rate that some experts guessed they would reach 20% of the GNP soon after the turn of the century. Americans had constructed a LO 10-5 health care system that provided physicians and hospitals with incentives to perform costly procedures and to provide expensive tests, in contrast to government-managed systems in Canada and most of Europe, where physicians’ and hospitals’ remuneration did not hinge on the volume of surgeries and procedures they provided. The use of private health insurance companies, with considerable marketing and administrative overheads, added huge costs—estimated at about 20%—to the American medical system, as compared with Canada and Europe. Nor should we forget Americans’ insatiable appetite for costly technology and drugs, which was further stimulated by the endless stream of innovations from huge biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms. Another factor increasing the nation’s health care costs was that tens of millions of poor and uninsured Americans, lacking access to primary care and preventive services, sought services only after their medical condition had become serious. Nor would it prove easy to surmount political barriers to basic reforms in the American health care system. Many entrenched interests—including private health insurance companies, physicians, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies—would resist reforms that curtailed their profits, revenues, or autonomy. Americans who already had coverage might resist any reforms that they feared would raise their health care costs or deplete their benefits. Moreover, those 40 million uninsured Americans— the people most needing health reforms—were not politically organized and often did not vote. Aware of the complexity of the health system and the political barriers in his path, Clinton nonetheless chose to prioritize health reform, partly for moral reasons but also to enhance his political fortunes, in the way that educational reform had helped him in Arkansas. He decided in early 1993 to place Hillary Clinton in charge of health care reform, with the assistance of Ira Magaziner, a liberal aide. Even in the spring and summer of 1993, controversy erupted within the administration about the scope of health reform. Advisors such as Lloyd Bentsen and Robert Rubin cautioned Clinton not to seek comprehensive reform; they feared it might increase federal expenditures at a time when the administration was under political pressure to diminish the budget deficit. While restructuring the health care system might eventually bring savings by reducing medical inflation, they warned that coverage of the 40 million uninsured Americans would require vast government outlays in the short term. Dismissing the warnings of Bill Clinton’s economic advisors, Hillary Clinton and Magaziner chose universal coverage as the central goal. They were convinced that huge savings could be realized by using market forces to contain providers’ fees and by using government power to force drug companies not to charge excessive prices. They realized, however, that health reform might mean large costs in the short run—even as much as $100 billion—to give uninsured Americans coverage. Indeed, they warned Clinton that health reform would require new taxes at the very time he was encountering increasing opposition to tax increases. * Despite opposition from key advisors, Bill Clinton agreed with Hillary Clinton and Magaziner that a major overhaul of American health care was required. He knew, however, that he could not get health legislation through the Congress in 1993 because he had to devote most of his energies to his economic package. He decided to establish a large task force, headed by Hillary Clinton and Magaziner, to define policy options. Partly as protection against special interests, such as physicians and hospitals, the task force met in secret. By early August, Clinton had made a pivotal choice: to establish universal coverage as the one principle for which he would risk losing the whole program; he was willing to negotiate other details of health reform. * He had decided by mid-August not to seek major new taxes to fund health care but to rely instead on a tax hike on cigarettes, cuts in existing programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and savings from efficiencies resulting from government-enforced competition. * Even before the task force began its work, the Clintons had decided to rely on a market-driven system with private insurances rather than a government single-payer system similar to those used in Canada and Britain. In a single- payer system, the government pays the medical fees of citizens in a manner akin to the Medicare program; private insurance companies are unnecessary. As the single payer, the government has extraordinary power over the medical system, both through its purchasing decisions (it determines what procedures it will fund and at what cost) and its regulations (it can regulate providers and drug companies; it can even decide what fraction of physicians will be specialists or general practitioners). Clinton rejected the single-payer system for several reasons. He knew that entrenched medical interests, such as doctors, would strongly oppose it. He also knew that Republicans and conservatives would attack a single-payer system as “big government.” Clinton also understood a simple economic fact: A single-payer system would require vast government resources at its outset; retention of the existing employer-funded benefits of the American system would demand far fewer tax revenues. When most citizens get their health benefits from employers, government has to fund benefits only for those citizens who are not covered by employers, such as unemployed people or older citizens. Were the United States to make the government the prime funder of benefits, hundreds of billions of dollars would have to be found to replace the expenditures currently borne by employers. Bill Clinton released Hillary Clinton’s plan in September 1993 in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress. He hoped his proposal would appeal to both moderate and liberal factions. Its emphasis on market competition, employers’ funding of benefits, and retention of private insurances made it consonant with the current health care system. Liberals liked its emphasis on universal coverage and requiring providers to give a basic package of benefits. In searching for a market-driven alternative to a single-payer system, Clinton drew on the work of many American economists, including Alain Enthoven. Enthoven had urged for many years that the government enroll all Americans in health maintenance organizations (HMOs). If the costs, quality, and scope of their plans were publicized, Enthoven reasoned, competition between HMOs would hold down health care costs. Clinton’s plan would establish regional health organizations (or alliances) that would provide competing plans—including both HMOs and plans initiated by insurance companies and providers—among which consumers could choose. The major provisions of Bill and Hillary Clinton’s plan were as follows: 1. Most employers would be required to fund health care for their employees, with some government subsidies to small employers. 2. The federal government would fund the purchase of private health insurance policies for unemployed people or part-time workers. 3. The government would establish the basic minimum coverage to be included in all health policies—including preventive services, drugs, and curative services. 4. Regional health care alliances would be developed to publicize competing health insurance policies so that consumers could select the plan that they wished—and change plans when they liked another plan better. 5. Private insurance companies would not be allowed to discontinue coverage for preexisting conditions. 6. The government would develop controls over the prices charged by pharmaceutical companies for existing and new drugs. 7. The government would provide every American with a health security card to be used when seeking services from health care plans. 8. Medicare and Medicaid would be retained, but their enrollees could join competing plans offered by regional health care alliances. Bill Clinton presented actual legislation on October 27, 1993. Already, however, battle lines had begun to be drawn. Many people criticized the sheer complexity of Clinton’s plan; his proposed legislation totaled 1,342 pages. Even top advisors in the administration could not grasp many of its technical features. Questions arose about the plan’s cost. Could it be funded only by efficiencies and a cigarette tax when it proposed to cover 40 million uninsured Americans and to add five new entitlements? (The Clintons insisted that the plan would cut the deficit by $91 billion by the year 2000 because they believed competition would markedly reduce costs.) Would insured Americans have to pay higher fees to help finance the plan? Would small employers be able to afford their employees’ health costs, even with government subsidies? What about doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, and drug companies? They had been entirely left out of planning. Would they oppose the legislation? Would the regional alliances’ preference for HMOs reduce freedom of choice? * The foes of Clinton’s plan wasted no time. Within days, rumors circulated that many insured Americans would pay higher fees. Polls showed that many Americans feared they would pay more for health insurance under the plan. Small businesses feared they would face huge new costs. Many middle-class Americans believed the plan would primarily help lower- income persons. Nor were providers and Republicans cautious about opposing the plan. Almost immediately, private health insurance companies encouraged these fears by financing a television campaign that featured Harry and Louise, a fictional middle-class couple who discussed their concerns about the Clinton plan. Neither liberals nor conservatives rallied to the plan. Many liberal Democrats favored a single-payer system akin to Canada’s and supported a plan by Representative Jim McDermott. Conservatives proposed an array of plans that minimized government involvement in health care; some did not include requirements that all businesses cover their employees, and some encouraged consumers to put aside savings for their own health care expenses. In turn, moderates wanted a scaled-back version of Clinton’s plan; some urged that universal coverage be delayed until after the turn of the century. These political problems were accentuated by the logistical problems of enacting health care in Congress, where it fell under the jurisdiction of several committees—three in the House and two in the Senate. Adrift in this maze of committees, the Clinton plan lost momentum; different committees came to differing conclusions. As providers continued to run advertisements attacking the legislation, the reservations of many middle-class citizens remained. Sensing an election-year issue, Republicans branded the Clinton proposal as unworkable or as excessively costly. * It was painfully clear by August 1994 that no plan would command a majority of legislators in either chamber. It is easy to blame Clinton’s plan for the failure of health reform, but it is not clear that any plan would have gained support from the Congress in 1994. In the extraordinarily complex U.S. health care system, too many groups—not least the private insurance companies—have a vested interest in the status quo. The American health care system polarizes Americans into insured people (who mostly get their insurance through their employers) and uninsured Americans (who tend to be relatively poor); insured people are fearful that their coverage will suffer, or their fees will rise, if uninsured Americans are brought into their system. The defeat of his health care plan was a crushing blow to Clinton. He had gambled that it could be enacted just prior to the congressional elections of 1994; instead, its defeat made him look ineffectual and renewed the public’s distaste for government gridlock. By portraying his plan as a bureaucratic, big government scheme, Republicans hoped to persuade many moderate and conservative Democrats to abandon Clinton in 1996 Congressional elections (see Insert 10.2 ). Insert 10.2. Critical Thinking about Gridlock President Clinton’s inability to get his social investments and health reform enacted suggest that “gridlock” often makes policy reforms impossible to achieve. Speculate about the causes of gridlock for these two measures. Is it futile to seek major social reforms in the United States? Speculate why President Obama was able to secure health legislation in 2010 (we discuss his success in Chapter 12 ). Analyze Anticrime Legislation The largest measure to be enacted in Clinton’s first term was not health care or social investments, but an anticrime measure. Realizing that many Americans listed crime as the nation’s most serious problem, Clinton was determined not to let Republicans monopolize the issue. He outlined the basic elements of a Democratic anticrime plan in August 1993: funds for 100,000 new police officers, new federal death penalties, and fewer appeals for death row inmates. Senate Democrats had obtained the Senate’s approval for a huge, $22.3 billion bill by November 1993, that also included funds for prison construction, a ban on some semiautomatic weapons, and programs to prevent violence against women. In April 1994, the House approved a similar measure; the House version also included significant funds for social services to prevent crime, such as recreation programs. Responding to charges that death sentences were disproportionately levied on African American inmates, the House bill also included a controversial measure to allow defendants to challenge their death sentences as racially discriminatory, on the basis of sentencing statistics. After deleting this measure, a conference committee approved a $30.2 billion bill, an unprecedented involvement by the federal government in local law enforcement. During deliberations on the conference report in the Senate, conservatives sought to portray the legislation as a monument to freewheeling Democratic spending; they were particularly offended by its generous funding of social services. In turn, Democrats charged that Republicans’ opposition to the legislation was an effort to appease the powerful National Rifle Association, which opposed the ban on 19 assault-type weapons. When finally signed by the president in mid-September, the legislation provided $8.8 billion to hire 100,000 new officers, $7.9 billion to help states build new prisons and boot camps, and $6.9 billion for social programs, including $1.6 billion to fund LO 10-6 the Violence Against Women Act, which provided federal penalties and programs to reduce domestic violence. It is ironic that Clinton’s major achievement in his first term proved not to be health care or social investments but a huge anticrime bill that largely funded expansion of police forces and new prisons. In its size, this bill rivaled his new spending for social investments of 1993. Its expenditures for social programs barely survived an onslaught from conservatives, who viewed them as social reform through the back door—and conservatives vowed to rescind these social programs if they controlled Congress after the impending 1994 elections. * This legislation came back to haunt the Clintons during Hillary Clinton’s quest for the presidency in 2016. The legislation supporting tough sentencing for crack, which was used by many African American youth, as compared to lighter sentencing for powder cocaine, which many white youth used. This legislation contributed to a 100-to-one sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. Clinton supported a “three strikes” federal law that would have fallen disproportionately on African Americans and Latinos. The legislation identified many new federal capital crimes. When combined with actions of prior presidents, the legislation contributed to incarceration rates for drug offenses in 2000 among African Americans that were 26 times their level in 1983 (Michelle Alexander, “Why Hillary Clinton Doesn’t Deserve the Black Vote,” The Nation , February 29, 2016.) Conservatives Regroup to Restore Republicans’ Power Convinced in 1987 that Robert Bork, President Reagan’s nominee for the Supreme Court, had been defeated by a coalition of feminist and civil rights groups, conservatives were determined not to let liberals shape future appointments. Many conservatives were still angry that President George H. W. Bush had accepted major tax increases as part of a deficit reduction package in 1990; they had long wanted social spending cuts, not tax increases, to bear the onus for deficit reduction. (Since the New Deal, many conservatives had believed that the welfare state would be curtailed only if the tax revenues that funded it were slashed.) The election of Bill Clinton in 1992 infuriated conservatives further; they regarded him as a political threat because he sought to co-opt conservative issues like reducing crime and cutting deficits that might allow him to win back Democrats who had voted for Republicans in the Reagan era. * Increasingly discontented, some conservative Republicans believed that they could complete Reagan’s work only by capturing control of Congress, and especially the elusive House of Representatives, which had been controlled by Democrats since 1955. They reasoned that Republicans would be well positioned to get spending cuts if they controlled the House, which initiates budget and tax legislation. It fell to a politician by the unlikely name of Newt Gingrich to realize the conservatives’ dreams. An army brat whose family lived on a succession of military bases, he had a great epiphany in 1958, when he visited Verdun, a battle site where 970,000 European troops had died in World War I. Determined to become a political leader who would prevent such cataclysms, he also decided that politics was like war, where brute power allows one side to prevail. Even by the mid-1970s, he wanted to become Speaker of the House, convinced that the Speaker was even more powerful than the president. After a brief stint as a college history teacher, Gingrich was finally elected to the House on his third attempt, in 1978. Initially a liberal Republican, Gingrich converted to conservatism after attending a campaign school run by Paul Weyrich, often called the father of the New Right. In a strategy meeting with Weyrich and others in 1980, Gingrich plotted how Republicans could take control of the House by 1992. He emphasized the importance of framing issues to allow conservatives to take the moral high ground from Democrats, by contrasting the “conservative opportunity society” (portrayed as emphasizing lower taxes, protection of innocent people from crime, responsible fatherhood, and work) with the “liberal welfare state” (portrayed as emphasizing higher taxes, the rights of criminals, and welfare dependency). He placed extraordinary emphasis on perceptions ; he argued that what actually happens is less crucial than how people perceive it. Conservatives could increase their power by manipulating and shaping popular perceptions to discredit liberals—a strategy that required frequent use of focus groups of voters to gauge what language and actions would allow conservatives to upstage liberals. He also emphasized tactics that featured surprise, manipulation, deception, and tactical ingenuity. * Gingrich operated on two levels in the 1980s. He destabilized the House by waging a kind of guerilla warfare against its Democratic leadership with such relish that he was nicknamed Neutron. He also masterminded a national strategy for electing conservative Republicans when he became the chair of GOPAC, a private organization that funded Republican campaigns using resources from wealthy donors. He carefully selected potential candidates who met his conservative litmus test. Drawing on GOPAC funds, he targeted roughly 50 House districts with substantial conservative constituencies. He built a cadre of loyal supporters and trained them by means of tapes and seminars that provided tactical suggestions—for example, attacking Democrats as “traitors,” “corrupt,” and “sick.” When elected, these conservatives acted cohesively in the Congress under his direction. With a growing contingent in the House, Gingrich and his allies needed to get control of leadership positions in the Republican Party to supplant older Republicans like Bob Dole, the Senate Minority Leader, and Robert Michel, the House Minority Leader. These older leaders were unacceptable to Gingrich for several reasons. Having lived through World War II and its aftermath, they were not as critical of the welfare state as Gingrich since their generation had benefited from such government programs as the GI Bill, FHA housing, and Social Security. Used to serving in Congress as the minority party, they excelled at cutting deals with Democrats rather than adopting intransigent positions. Gingrich narrowly won the position of Minority Whip in 1989—and his close friend Dick Armey became chair of the House Republican Conference in late 1992. With Michel’s retirement in late 1993, Gingrich became Minority Leader in early 1994. * In addition to party leadership and GOPAC funds, conservatives supplemented their power with a “loosely knit group that included think tanks, foundations, columnists, direct-mail operations, talk-show hosts, and various self-appointed spokespeople.” * Formed by Weyrich, the Heritage Foundation viewed itself as a public relations firm, providing conservative solutions to a range of issues. So-called pro-family research groups, which stressed traditional family roles and anti-welfare positions, included the Family Research Council, the Eagle Forum (headed by Phyllis Schlafly), and Concerned Women for America (see Insert 10.3 ). Republicans possessed remarkable access to the mass media. Weyrich’s National Empowerment Television distributed conservative ideology to 11 million cable subscribers; televangelists such as Pat Robertson coupled religious and political messages, and talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh reached tens of millions of Americans on radio and television. Conservative opinions were regularly disseminated by columnists such as Robert Novak and by the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal . Wealthy individuals, such as beer magnate Joseph Coors and Richard Scaife of the Mellon family, as well as large foundations like the Bradley and Olin foundations, contributed tens of millions of dollars to think tanks, publications, research, and political campaigns. The conservative message was also outlined in best-selling books by authors such as Charles Murray and William Bennett. Pat Robertson’s Christian Coalition, the successor to the Moral Majority, continued to organize huge mailings to voters in pivotal districts. Insert 10.3. Critical Analysis: The Causes of Births to Unwed W omen Conservatives have often argued that “illegitimacy” stems from the “perverse incentives” provided by the welfare system. In this perspective, unwed women, often in their teens, decide to have children to secure welfare benefits. Analyze this contention by asking the following questions: 1. Under what circumstances are our actions shaped or determined by externally imposed rewards or punishments? So as to be specific, identify cases where your actions are (or are not) shaped by rewards and punishments. (To get started, you might begin with relatively trivial actions—for example, whether the speed at which you drive is determined by the danger of receiving tickets. Then proceed to major life decisions of various kinds.) 2. In the case of unwed teenage women, to what extent are their pregnancies shaped or caused by: a. calculation of likely welfare benefits b. role models, such as a mother who was unwed at the time her children were born c. rape or forced sex d. lack of knowledge of birth control or lack of availability of birth control devices e. a desire for meaning or companionship in life f. cultural factors—for example, the belief among people of all social classes that unwed pregnancies are a legitimate lifestyle choice 3. To what extent do teenage women become pregnant because they believe that they lack economic, educational, or career options? 4. In light of the preceding discussion, would you expect coercive policies, such as denying or cutting benefits, to markedly decrease rates of births to unwed women? Conservatives were more adept than liberals at reaching the broader public and using their economic resources to promote their ideas. While conservatives often depicted the media as liberal, the major news shows were usually neutral in their coverage since liberals had virtually no mass audience outlets. Although the Brookings Institution and other relatively liberal think tanks operated in the same way as academic departments, conservative think tanks were intensely partisan. They disseminated research and opinions that conformed to conservative tenets. Whereas fundamentalist religious groups possessed large mailing lists and actively intervened in elections, relatively liberal religious groups lacked a massive grassroots capability. * Understand How the House Republicans T ook Charge EP 1b This conservative network was adept at shaping the public’s perceptions of the Clinton administration in negative ways in 1993 and 1994. Armey’s Republican Conference fashioned health reform and welfare reform proposals that emphasized market forces and work requirements, which Republicans contrasted with Clinton’s proposals. The Wall Street Journal and congressional Republicans publicized what they called the Whitewater scandal, which centered on allegations of financial improprieties by the Clintons in Arkansas. Talk show hosts circulated sexual misconduct allegations against Clinton. Not wanting Clinton to benefit in the 1994 elections, Republicans stymied his health reform and welfare legislation in 1994. Even though Clinton had proposed a plan to reduce the federal deficit markedly in his first term, Republicans portrayed him as a big spender who did not care about the deficit. When Clinton raised taxes on affluent people, Republicans said that he waged “class warfare”; they neglected to mention that many of their policies would help affluent Americans. Nor were some Republicans hesitant to attack Hillary Clinton’s policy roles as inappropriate for the first lady. Throughout 1994, the administration was aware that, historically, the party that sits in the White House has usually incurred some losses in off-year congressional elections, but it clearly was not expecting the bombshell that hit Washington on November 8, 1994. LO 10-7 In the lead-up to the November 1994 congressional elections, Republicans issued a policy document that outlined their goals for the coming session of Congress were they to gain majorities in each chamber. (See Box 10.1 .) Box 10.1. Provisions of the Contract with America 1. Balancing the budget and tax limitation: a constitutional amendment requiring that Congress submit a balanced budget each year; a requirement that tax increases could be enacted only if a three-fifths majority of Congress voted for them—a policy that would usually put the burden of balancing the budget on spending cuts rather than tax increases; a legislative line-item veto to restore fiscal responsibility. 2. Strengthening national defense: legislation requiring that no U.S. troops be placed under UN command; restoration of funding for essential parts of national security. 3. Tax cuts to strengthen families and to benefit middle-class people: a $500-per-child tax credit for families with annual incomes up to $200,000; repeal of the marriage tax penalty, which causes many married couples to pay higher taxes than are levied on two single people; creation of American Dream Savings Accounts to allow individuals to contribute up to $2,000 a year to a tax-free account for retirement income, the purchase of a first home, education expenses, or medical costs. 4. Aid to senior citizens: an increase in the Social Security earnings limit—which currently forces seniors out of the workforce—from $11,160 to $30,000 over 5 years. 5. Welfare reform: denial of welfare to mothers under age 18; denial of higher payments to mothers who give birth to additional children while on welfare; a strict 2-year-and-out provision for recipients; more stringent work requirements, to promote individual responsibility; a cap on spending for AFDC, SSI, and public housing programs; consolidation of nutrition programs such as Food Stamps, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the school lunch program into a block grant to states; permission for states to opt out of the current AFDC program by converting their share of AFDC payments into fixed annual block grants. 6. Reform of unfunded mandates and incentives to business: termination or reform of unfunded mandates, in which the federal government requires state and local governments to implement specific policies without providing the resources for them to do so; a cut in the capital gains tax to stimulate investment. 7. Strengthening the family: more stringent child support enforcement; larger tax incentives for adoption; stronger child pornography laws; tax credit for people who care for an elderly parent or grandparent. 8. Legal reforms to curb litigation: loser-pays laws; reasonable limits on punitive damage awards; reform of product liability laws. 9. Anticrime legislation: stronger truth-in-sentencing laws; effective death penalty provisions; elimination of social spending included in the 1994 Crime Bill and use of these resources to fund prison construction and additional police officers; easier deportation of illegal aliens convicted of felonies. 10. Term limits: limits on the years that federal politicians can serve—for example, six 2-year terms for House members and two 6- year terms for senators. The Republican gains in November were truly devastating for the Democrats. Not only did the Republicans gain majority status in both houses of Congress, thereby ending 40 years of Democratic control of at least one house, but they also gained a majority of the nation’s governorships and control of 17 more state legislative chambers. (Not a single incumbent Republican governor or federal legislator was defeated.) A large majority of these Republican winners, especially in the House, were young and extremely conservative; they wanted to dismantle the remnants of the Great Society, which they felt had caused America’s moral decline. (Gingrich now possessed a cadre of nearly 80 conservatives in the House, as well as many Republican moderates, who were dedicated to slashing government domestic spending.) Long a minority party in the South, Republicans emerged as its major party in national elections. * Interpreting the election results as a repudiation of President Clinton and the Democratic party, Republicans vowed to enact a series of policies that were described in the Contract with America, a document created during the campaign by House Republican members and candidates. * The basic tenets of the contract were articulated in February of 1994: individual liberty, economic opportunity, limited government, personal responsibility, and security at home and abroad. When they released the completed contract on September 27, 1994, House Republican members and candidates promised that, if they controlled the House, they would enact its 10 provisions in 100 days ( Box 10.1 ). With the contract as its guiding framework, House Republicans took the offensive in the spring of 1995, when they dominated policy discourse in the United States. Clinton was relegated to a background role, as the House Republicans fulfilled their promise of enacting most items of the contract within 100 days even if the Republican Senate enacted fewer of them. Analyze the Budget Confrontation of 1995 EP 3a EP 3b In 1995, the major political event was a titanic budget confrontation between Democrats and Republicans and between the White House and Congress. Republicans could accomplish their goal of shrinking the federal government only by shaping the federal budget through Budget Resolutions, a reconciliation bill, and 13 appropriation bills. Like Reagan in 1981, Gingrich wanted to use the budget process to implement his conservative agenda; he hoped to force huge spending cuts and the return of many federally funded programs to the states at the same time as he was enacting large tax cuts and significant increases in defense spending. More militant than Reagan, Gingrich wanted to terminate three entitlement programs (Food Stamps, Medicaid, and AFDC) by converting them to block grants to the states. This elimination of entitlements was a massive assault on the American welfare state; it attacked the fundamental concept that the federal government ought to avert starvation and dire suffering—an obligation first articulated by Franklin Roosevelt six decades earlier. Gingrich planned to use confrontational tactics; even in April of 1995, he predicted that the government might have to shut down when the president and the Congress reached an impasse over the budget. Gingrich needed a dramatic goal that would galvanize Americans and Republicans to support cuts in spending. Early in the debate, House members decided not merely to seek a constitutional amendment requiring LO 10-8 a balanced budget but also to commit Congress to balancing the budget within 7 years. Adopting a specific time frame forced Clinton and the Democrats onto the defensive. In 1993, after all, they had merely sought to decrease the annual deficits. When Senate Republicans supported the proposal to balance the budget in 7 years, the stage was set for Budget Resolutions to accomplish this target. In demanding that the budget be balanced by the year 2002, House Republicans took a calculated political gamble. They would have to cut more than $1.5 trillion from the budget, even without considering the large tax cuts and considerable increases in defense spending that they wanted. They could reach their goal only by focusing on entitlements, particularly Medicare, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and Social Security, which constituted the bulk of the domestic budget, as illustrated in Figure 10.1 . (Analysts estimated that health costs would cause government spending just on entitlements to rise above the federal government’s total revenues in just over 25 years.) Republicans knew that these entitlements had strong support from the public, as well as from powerful interest groups—support so strong that even Reagan had demurred from seeking major cuts in them. They hoped that public support for deficit reduction would allow them to cut some entitlements and to terminate others by passing them to the states in block grants. Even in November, Gingrich had admitted that all entitlements except Social Security would be put on the table for trimming. Because discretionary spending had already been cut extensively during the Reagan and Bush years, as well as by Clinton’s deficit reduction plan of 1993, further cuts would not provide the bulk of the funds needed to bring a balanced budget. * After the House GOP announced its plans to balance the budget in 7 years, the congressional Democrats complained that the goal could be reached only by a mean-spirited slashing of America’s social programs for the poor as well as for the middle class. The Democrats also charged the GOP with attempting to fund tax cuts for the rich by slashing social programs. They demanded that the House leadership reveal exactly how they would balance the budget in 7 years. Aware that the public supported balancing the budget in general terms, the Democrats instead attempted to focus on the pain that would occur when specific cuts were made in programs widely used by Americans, such as Medicare. It was, then, Gingrich vs. Clinton in a game of budget chicken. Gingrich pressed forward now that Republicans controlled the House of Representatives. He proposed deep cuts in discretionary social spending and entitlements. Clinton and his Democratic allies refused to accept Gingrich’s demands—although bending at the last minute to agree to spending cuts that would balance the budget in 10 rather than 7 years. Gingrich refused to back away from his quest to balance the budget in 7 years. A budget impasse developed that prevented the enactment of a federal budget. If Gingrich and Republicans wanted relatively deep cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and discretionary spending, Democrats favored no cuts or much smaller ones in these areas. Republicans favored increases in military spending. The result was a long shutdown of the federal government because it could not pay its bills. Not only were large numbers of federal civil service workers laid off, but the entire government shut down its activities. The public was outraged when residents learned that the national parks, the Smithsonian Museum, and other federal institutions’ services were shuttered. As the weeks of the shutdown continued, citizens also criticized the large cuts in entitlements that Gingrich and his allies had demanded. Congress and the White House finally agreed on a budget on April 24, 1996, but it contained far lower cuts than Gingrich had sought—and the fate of entitlements and tax cuts had not been resolved. The public widely viewed Clinton as the victor in his battle with Gingrich, who had to concede to Clinton’s policies. This victory by Clinton helped him win the presidential election of 1996 against Republican Bob Dole. Read in more detail about Clinton’s battle with Gingrich in the MindTap for this book under the heading, “The Budget Duel Between President Clinton and Newt Gingrich in 1995 and 1996.” Answer the following questions: Why are entitlements, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security more difficult to cut than programs funded by the discretionary budget? How did Clinton make clever use of timing during his battle with Gingrich? What concessions did Clinton feel he had to make to Gingrich even as he emerged as the victor of this budget battle? How did Gingrich use budget deficits as a cudgel to make Clinton accept his cuts in entitlements and domestic discretionary spending? Why was Clinton the victor in this budget battle with Gingrich even though he had to make some concessions? Clinton’ s Controversial W elfare Reform As the nation headed into the summer, Republicans were convinced they could use the welfare issue to their advantage in the forthcoming presidential elections. They aired commercials blaming Clinton for vetoing welfare reform measures, saying he had broken his 1992 campaign promise to “end welfare as we know it.” When presented with another Republican version of welfare reform in August that was similar to prior versions but that retained Medicaid as an entitlement rather than a block grant, Clinton signed it over the vehement opposition of some cabinet members and data generated by top civil servants that it would cast millions of children into poverty when their families lost access to safety net programs. Although Clinton removed the issue of welfare reform from the presidential campaign of 1996 by signing the legislation, he ended the AFDC entitlement while providing scant resources for extended child care and job training. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Act of 1996 consisted of nine titles or sets of provisions that covered welfare, SSI, eligibility of immigrants for public benefits, child care, child nutrition, and Food Stamps. Its welfare provisions replaced AFDC with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Block Grant (TANF) to be funded until the year 2002 roughly at the annual level of federal expenditures for AFDC in the year preceding the enactment of TANF. (After 2002, Congress could fund TANF at any level that it desired. * ) With the AFDC entitlement gone, the federal government would not have to fund welfare benefits to the level of claimed benefits each year, so many liberals feared that a conservative Congress might slash federal involvement considerably or entirely in the years after 2002, leaving the major responsibility for welfare to the states. This scenario was ominous because many policy analysts believed the states would commence a “race to the bottom” where they would lower benefits to prevent recipients from other states (with lower benefits) from migrating to states with higher benefits. * (States with costly social programs also might fear that they would have to raise taxes to pay for them—a policy that could lead citizens and corporations to relocate in states with lower taxes.) TANF stipulated that the states must ensure that adult recipients participate in work or work-related activities after receiving 2 years of cumulative benefits, with 25% of the single-parent family caseload participating by 1997 and 50% by 2002. (Seventy-five percent of two-parent families would be required to participate by 1997.) It stated that recipients could receive cash assistance for a maximum of 5 years over a lifetime with limited exceptions for no more than 20% of caseloads. It prohibited the use of federal funds for minor parents under 18 not participating in school activities or living in an adult-supervised setting. While imposing these regulations on the states, the legislation gave them remarkable latitude in other areas, unlike the defunct AFDC program. They could eliminate cash aid entirely if they chose, replacing it with any combination of cash and in-kind benefits; deny assistance to teen parents or other kinds of recipients; establish even more severe time limits; provide benefits to new residents at the same level as the state from which they emigrated for up to 1 year; or deny aid to persons convicted of a drug felony after August of 1996 unless they participated in a rehabilitation program. Nor did the legislation require uniform statewide standards. The legislation gave local welfare workers enormous discretion in deciding whom to cut off the rolls as recipients faced time limits and as they tried to comply with work requirements—discretion that had been greatly reduced in the AFDC program by legislation and court rulings. TANF families were no longer automatically eligible for Medicaid, even though persons meeting the old AFDC income standards could often receive it based on income. Changing the eligibility formula, such as not allowing families to deduct more than 50% of their rent or housing costs from their income to determine the amount of stamps they could receive, reduced Food Stamp benefits. Furthermore, the maximum Food Stamp benefit level was reduced by 3%—and severe restrictions were placed on benefits of childless able- bodied individuals. The legislation contained, as well, an array of other extraneous restrictive measures involving Medicaid, Food Stamps, children, and immigrants. (We discuss measures involving children and immigrants subsequently.) Clinton did not have to sign welfare reform legislation in light of his substantial lead in the polls over Republican opponent Bob Dole in August of 1999. He might, for example, have insisted on more ample training, child care, and education funds—or upon procedural safeguards for former recipients by requiring states to provide them with ongoing assistance if their wages and assistance from other programs did not raise them above poverty lines. He could have insisted that the federal entitlement be retained even if welfare was substantially reformed so that future Congresses could not severely cut welfare funding beneath claimed benefits. He could have insisted that single mothers with children be included in a broader program of training and education for all workers, male and female, who lacked credentials and skills to obtain jobs that paid sufficient wages to bring them above poverty lines. * Decades later, the economic plight of single mothers remained serious. Far from lifting them from poverty, TANF made it more difficult for many of them to support their children. Many states cut benefits. Job programs were often ineffective; as we shall see in Chapter 11 , many TANF recipients became homeless, resorted to selling blood, or became prostitutes during the Great Recession of 2007–2009. The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 was a first step toward ending discrimination of private health insurance companies toward mental health conditions. It disallowed them from establishing aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits on mental health services if they covered them. We will discuss more far-reaching federal mental-health legislation in Chapter 11 . Pitted against Dole in the presidential contest, Clinton won a landslide victory in November of 1996, but he again faced a Republican Congress during his second term because Democrats made only minor inroads in the House and the Senate. Clinton’ s Second Term While the budget legislation of 1996 had established the goal of balancing the federal budget by 2002, it had not stated how this goal would be achieved. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provided the answers: huge cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, as well as severe caps on discretionary spending. It made the most sweeping changes in the Medicare Program since its inception 32 years previously. The legislation envisioned that most elderly recipients would eventually obtain Medicare health care from managed care organizations in a cost-saving move. While elderly Medicare patients had possessed considerable latitude in selecting physicians, just as their physicians had possessed autonomy in selecting those treatments and medications that they wished to offer or prescribe, many health economists regarded these traditional arrangements as wasteful. They feared that patients often demanded and received treatments that were not necessary or that were excessively expensive. Why not, many legislators demanded, place Medicare patients in managed care organizations where central administrators would scrutinize (and veto in some instances) treatment decisions and where patients would obtain care only from those physicians and hospitals that agreed to discounted rates? While Medicare had long offered an HMO option to Medicare enrollees, the 1997 legislation now required other managed care options, including provider-sponsored organizations (where hospitals or physicians developed plans) and preferred provider organizations (where insurance companies or providers developed plans whose enrollees had to obtain treatment from a roster of physicians and hospitals that agreed to charge discounted fees and to secure central approval for treatments). Fearing that home health care that provided Medicare-funded services to seniors in their homes was becoming excessively costly, the legislation slashed home health fees by 15%. Cuts were made, as well, in Medicaid by deleting higher federal Medicaid subsidies to hospitals serving large numbers of poor or uninsured persons—a blow to many teaching hospitals that served these persons disproportionately. The legislation also allowed governors to place Medicaid recipients in managed care organizations without having to secure permission (or waivers) from federal authorities. * The 1997 budget deal also resorted to harsh cuts in discretionary spending, establishing caps on it that were so severe that it could not even keep up with inflation through 2002—a policy that boded ill for federal spending on social services, education, training, and employment for the next 6 years. Future federal funding of these domestic programs was rendered even bleaker because the president and Congress supported substantial increases in military spending in coming years, which is also funded by the discretionary budget. Whereas Congress prevented direct competition between domestic and military components of the discretionary budget before 2000 by earmarking what share would go to domestic and military programs, it allowed them to compete with one another from the year 2000 onward when increases in military spending might further erode resources for the domestic agenda. (Even in the mid- and late 1990s, many critics wondered if the military needed huge budgets in a post-Cold War era when the United States primarily had to deal with regional conflicts such as those in Somalia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.) * With scant resources available to him in the discretionary budget, Clinton cleverly obtained major educational reforms in 1997 by securing enactment of several tax expenditures (or tax concessions) that together provided $35 billion in benefits. (Unlike social programs funded by discretionary spending, tax expenditures do not have to compete with other programs in annual budget battles since citizens automatically obtain their benefits through the tax code.) He enacted HOPE scholarships, which were tax credits (or rebates) of up to $1,500 for the first 2 years of postsecondary education for students whose parents possessed adjusted gross income of less than $50,000 for a single parent or $100,000 for two parents. He established a Lifetime Learning Credit for students in the last 2 years of college or in graduate school, allowing them to claim credits up to $1,000 per year assuming their parents met income eligibility standards similar to the HOPE scholarships. He established education savings accounts to be formed by annual contributions (not to exceed $500) of parents whose principal and interest could be withdrawn tax free to finance a portion of their children’s postsecondary education. * (He also signed the Adoption and Safe Families Act in 1997, as will be discussed subsequently.) However, the relatively amicable atmosphere of 1997 soon dissipated in 1998 and led to polarized, stalemated politics during 1998 and 1999. Much of 1998, as well as early 1999, was consumed by a sexual scandal involving the president and Monica Lewinsky, a woman that Clinton met when she was a student intern assigned to the White House. After falsely denying he had had an affair to a grand jury, a judge, and the public, Clinton belatedly admitted it. Contending that Clinton had committed perjury, Republican leaders made the affair the centerpiece of their quest to defeat Democrats in the 1998 congressional elections. Partly because the public had tired of the issue, this tactic backfired when the public delivered a crushing defeat to Republicans in elections that reduced their hold on the House to a razor-thin majority and brought the sudden resignation of Gingrich from the House Speakership after Republican legislators, blaming him for this failed tactic, said they would no longer support him. Collaboration between Clinton and Republicans was further diminished by the decision of House Republicans to impeach Clinton by approving a resolution in late 1998 asking the Senate to hold a trial to determine whether he would be removed from office. The matter was dismissed when the Senate failed to secure a two-thirds vote for removal of the president in early 1999. Neither Republican leadership nor Clinton was inclined to collaborate under these circumstances, even though major issues, such as the future of Medicare and Social Security, gun control, and patient rights hung in the balance, as well as policies about the spending of an emerging budget surplus. Federal legislation on guns had first emerged in the so-called Brady Bill in Clinton’s first term, which established a waiting period and criminal check for purchasers of handguns. Although subsequent federal legislation also banned certain kinds of assault weapons, these modest measures did not prevent the proliferation of guns in the United States, whether they were handguns, rifles, or assault weapons. Gun control reemerged into the national spotlight after 1996 in the wake of mass slayings in schools, churches, and places of employment, culminating in the April 1999 massacre of 12 students and a teacher in Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Clinton and Democrats took the initiative in seeking bans on gun sales on the Internet and at gun shows, expanded federal criminal background checks of purchasers of guns, increases in the minimum age for purchasing firearms from 18 to 21, bans of high-capacity ammunition clips, and installation of mandatory lock devices on guns. When the Republican Party belatedly agreed to ban the sale of guns at gun shows, Clinton attacked their proposal as inadequate. No new legislation had been enacted by mid-2000. Social Security entered the spotlight in 1998 as data were widely publicized that the Trust Fund would be depleted around 2032 as the ratio of employed workers to retirees diminished with the anticipated retirement of millions of baby boomers who were born between the end of World War II and 1960. If many Republicans and conservatives wanted to partially or completely privatize Social Security by allowing citizens to manage their own federal retirement funds, most liberals staunchly opposed this policy on the grounds that some citizens might make ill-advised investment choices that rendered themselves impoverished in their retirement years or that privatization would eventually lead many middle- and upper-class persons to diminish their support for Social Security itself by demanding that they be exempted from having to pay payroll taxes to allow themselves to manage their own funds. (Under this scenario, they contended, Social Security would become a poor persons’ or voluntary program.) Considerable controversy arose, as well, about the advisability of raising the early retirement age from 62 to 65 and the normal retirement age to 70 in the next century as a cost-saving measure. (The normal retirement age was already scheduled to rise from 65 to 67 in 2020. * ) Nor could Congress and the president reach an agreement on ways to preserve the solvency of Medicare, which might prove unable to fund hospital benefits as early as 2012 due to the growing elderly population. * A bipartisan Medicare Commission failed to reach agreement on central issues, even as its co-chairpersons supported giving senior citizens and disabled persons vouchers to purchase health care in the private sector. After liberals objected to this strategy on the grounds that it would undermine Medicare by privatizing it, Clinton then seized the initiative by proposing to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs. Contending that senior citizens’ health care was often compromised when they could not afford increasingly expensive and sophisticated medications, Clinton also proposed to help senior citizens obtain price concessions from drug companies through volume purchases. Republicans rejected Clinton’s proposals, so no reforms of Medicare were enacted in 1999. Congress stalemated, as well, on the issue of patient rights in managed care systems. If only a small fraction of Americans were enrolled in managed care systems at the start of the 1990s, most Americans received their health care through them by the end of the decade partly because employers, wishing to cut the cost of the health insurance fringe benefit, required employees to select managed care policies. Flagrant abuses often existed in these systems, which were often for-profit organizations. Central administrators sometimes issued so-called gag orders to physicians, instructing them not to tell patients about certain procedures, medications, or tests even when they were medically advisable. Sometimes central administrators denied needed treatments to patients—or developed such lengthy reviews of physician requests that patients died before they could secure advisable treatments. Patients were often denied access to specialists by screening physicians even when they needed their care—or were not even told that specialists existed. Managed care systems often required enrollees to sign statements they would not sue for malpractice, while also not establishing patient appeal procedures. (Some denials of treatment were, of course, meritorious when ill-advised procedures were suggested by physicians or demanded by patients. * ) Nor were these abuses limited to the treatment of physical conditions, as mental health services were often provided by managed care systems as well. Many social workers in managed care organizations complained that central managers and staff excessively circumscribed them. Indeed, the National Association of Social Workers supported a federal class action suit ( Hostein v. Green Spring ) against nine managed care behavioral health companies that served 115 million people in 1999 on the grounds that they reduced rates paid to care providers “to reap higher profits.” * During Clinton’s second term, two important policy victories occurred in the mental health and health fields despite stalemated congressional politics. Partly due to the leadership of Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, federal legislation was enacted in 1996 that required private health insurance companies not to discriminate against mental health problems in their plans. Using the simplistic argument that coverage of these problems would trigger excessive use of counseling services, health insurance companies had provided no or scant coverage for mental problems for decades—a deficit that was compounded by meager coverage of these problems by Medicare and Medicaid. While public attention focused on cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, an important enhancement occurred in 1997 when Clinton secured enactment of a children’s health insurance program (CHIP) to give grants of $20 billion to the states to provide health insurance to uninsured children. If the program was initially plagued by poor implementation, it grew rapidly in succeeding years rapidly in succeeding years as states could use the funds to expand their Medicaid programs to include children or could establish special plans for them. It was set to expire in 2017 and had ominously not been re-authorized by December 12, 2017. The Clinton administration failed to enact sweeping campaign finance legislation. * While caps were placed on individuals’ and corporate contributions made directly to candidates, no caps existed on the so-called soft money that was given to political parties. Political parties, in turn, often used these funds for mailings and mass media spots that highlighted specific issues during campaigns that were clearly intended to assist specific candidates, thus providing them with publicity identical to mailings and spots financed by their own funds. Parties sometimes poured millions of dollars into specific campaigns at the behest of special interests. Various techniques were used, as well, to get around caps on contributions to individuals, allowing George W. Bush, for example, to amass $50 million months before the first primary in the presidential contest of 2000. Although the House enacted campaign finance legislation several times, it was filibustered to death by Republican senators, thus defeating legislation developed by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold to place some limits on campaign contributions. The American system of financing campaigns biases social policy toward preferences of corporations and wealthy individuals, whose combined contributions far exceed contributions of unions, teachers, and the AARP. That the United States had failed by 2000 to develop comprehensive health insurance, for example, was partly due to decades of campaign contributions by physicians, managed care corporations, and pharmaceutical companies. Nearly 45 million Americans were medically uninsured in 1999, including at least 10 million children. Millions of elderly citizens with chronic medical conditions had to bankrupt themselves to obtain eligibility for Medicaid. In fact, domestic discretionary spending declined from the late 1970s through 2000 as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), as will be discussed more fully in Chapter 14 . In the midst of this budget scarcity, a glimmer of hope finally emerged in early 1998 when Clinton predicted a $219 billion surplus over 5 years as he announced a balanced budget on February 2. It seemed too good to be true after 17 years of mega-deficits, particularly when he predicted that surpluses would rise from $10 billion to $258 billion between 1999 and 2008—and the Congressional Budget Office doubled its estimate of the likely surplus within the next months to $1.6 trillion over the next decade. What would normally be good news triggered new rounds of political conflict in the polarized and stalemated atmosphere of the late 1990s. Realizing that Republicans would insist that the surplus be used to fund massive tax cuts, Clinton’s budget in early 1998 sought to use the imminent surplus to fund modest spending increases in domestic programs while using the remaining funds to “save” Social Security even if he provided few specifics. Republicans immediately demanded tax cuts and large cuts in domestic discretionary programs, but they capitulated in late 1998 by accepting Clinton’s modest spending increases for childcare and education in return for a small tax cut. The budget battle of 1998 was a mere skirmish, however, as compared with the budget battle of 1999, which both parties viewed as a prelude to the elections of 2000 when both the presidency and Congress would be up for grabs. Now the budget surpluses were estimated by the administration to run $117 billion in the coming fiscal year—and $4.47 trillion over the next 15 years. Clinton developed a clever proposal for putting Republicans on the defensive by both “saving” Social Security and Medicare and reducing the nearly $7 trillion national debt that had largely accumulated after President Reagan’s large tax cuts of 1981. He proposed to place surplus monies from the budget in the Social Security Trust Fund, which, in turn, would receive IOUs from the Treasury Department when it lent these funds to it so that it could pay off the federal debt by retiring the bonds issued to fund it. (Retirement of the national debt would have positive economic consequences, Clinton contended, such as reducing interest rates as the federal government preempted less private capital to fund its debt.) When it was unable to completely fund Social Security pensions in 2014 when payroll taxes were no longer sufficient, the Trust Fund would redeem these IOUs by obtaining monies from the Treasury Department—a policy that would allow it to remain solvent to 2050. (Its existing IOUs, obtained by using its surpluses to help fund general government expenses in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, sufficed to the year 2032, but the new IOUs would keep the Trust Fund solvent until 2050. * ) Clinton’s double-barreled strategy of coupling the rescue of Social Security with reducing the federal debt allowed him to attack Republican demands for a tax cut of nearly $1 trillion spread over several years. He attacked these tax cuts on the grounds that they would both undermine Social Security and increase the national debt. Republicans attacked Clinton’s proposal as a budgeting gimmick that would deplete surplus resources so as to disallow a large tax cut. Clinton’s plan could be attacked, as well, from a liberal perspective. Although reducing the national debt made good economic sense, the diversion of trillions of dollars to this effort over a period of years meant that domestic discretionary spending would continue to be shortchanged. Subject to caps and freezes during the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations, domestic discretionary spending had actually declined from more than 4% of GDP in the late 1970s to less than 2.5% by 2000—and budget experts expected it to decline to roughly 2% by 2004. Federal spending on education, training, employment, and social programs, moreover, had declined from roughly 1.75% of GDP to less than 1% of GDP from the late 1970s to 2000. * Why not use more of these surplus funds for discretionary spending—or means- tested programs as Food Stamps and the EITC? Why not use them to fund jobs or job training for unemployed or underemployed people, such as improving the nation’s fraying infrastructure? Undeterred, Republicans proposed huge tax cuts and massive cuts in discretionary domestic spending, wanting to reduce it by 18% by 2001 and by nearly 30% by 2009. Clinton was not generous to domestic discretionary spending, either, but his proposed cuts were less than half the size of the Republicans’ cuts. As the president and the Republican Congress staked out opposing positions, it became obvious that the two parties would battle over how to spend budget surpluses for years to come. If the president pledged to veto any large tax cuts as well as excessive cuts in domestic discretionary programs, Republicans vowed to fight for their tax and spending cuts. Identify the Oppression of V ulnerable Populations The Oppression of W omen EP 2a EP 2c EP 5a Women’s reproductive rights were under attack by conservatives during the Clinton era. Although Congress enacted a measure that made the use or threat of force against workers or clients of abortion clinics a federal crime, women found it difficult to exercise reproductive choice when confronted with pickets at clinics or when forced to travel 50 miles, on average, to find a clinic that would perform abortions. * The so-called morning-after pill, a simple means of abortion that was commonly used in Europe, was not widely available in the United States, partly because pharmaceutical companies feared boycotts of their other products by abortion foes. * The medical profession itself retreated from providing abortion services; most hospitals did not offer the procedure, and most medical students were not even taught how to perform it. * Conservative members of Congress, having succeeded in blocking the use of federal funds for abortions, attached riders to legislation to restrict abortion further. LO 10-9 They hoped to make late-term abortions illegal, even when the mother’s life was endangered. By attaching a rider to a defense authorization bill that President Clinton felt he had to sign, they secured the prohibition of abortions in military hospitals. Opponents of abortion relentlessly attached amendments to many pieces of legislation, including the Hyde amendment (named after Representative Henry Hyde), which was annually attached to appropriations for DHHS and the Department of Labor and that prohibited federal funding of abortions except in the case of rape or incest or if a woman’s life was in jeopardy. (It was later expanded to preclude use of Medicaid funds to pay for managed care health plans that covered abortions.) They attached an amendment beginning in 1995 that banned federal employees’ health plans from financing abortions. But proponents of choice also won some victories. Because it did not exempt women whose health or lives would otherwise be in jeopardy, Clinton vetoed a ban on “partial birth” abortions—abortions in the third trimester when a living fetus is partially delivered before it is killed. Opponents of choice failed to bar aid to international family planning groups that promote or perform abortions. On the economic front, women had made substantial gains in some areas during the 1990s. Large numbers of women continued to gain admission to professional schools in law, business, and medicine. With the help of federally funded training programs, some women had entered nontraditional fields such as the trades. These gains were offset, however, by a continuing and extraordinary gap between the median wages of men and women. Moreover, many professional women continued to encounter the so-called glass ceiling; they were not promoted to higher positions even when their job performance excelled. Republicans’ policies —in particular, their challenges to AFDC and the Earned-Income Tax Credit—threatened the economic standing of the many women who were single heads of families in low-wage jobs. Moreover, feminists feared that women’s economic progress would lose its momentum if Republicans succeeded in terminating affirmative action and set-asides that reserved federal job-training slots and contracts for women. Most European nations have funded absences from work for parents after the birth of a child or the death of a family member. In the United States, however, corporations and many conservatives have staunchly resisted such policies. Social reformers gained a limited victory with the enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required employers to give all but their top employees up to 12 weeks of leave to take care of a new baby or an ill family member. However, the legislation excluded individuals who had not worked for an employer for at least 12 months and excluded businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Although workers were guaranteed leaves, employers were not required to pay them during those periods. Thus, low-income workers were not easily able to take advantage of this new policy. * We have already discussed the mixed record of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Act of 1996 during the 3 years after its enactment. (We discuss the outcomes of this legislation more fully in the next chapter .) Clinton was able to obtain some modifications of the 1996 welfare reform legislation in succeeding years, such as getting a $3 billion fund enacted to help states put long-term recipients into the workforce; clarifying that recipients placed in public employment programs had to be paid at least the minimum wage; providing Medicaid benefits for disabled children who lost SSI benefits; and restoring some Food Stamp benefits in 1997. States experienced, moreover, a remarkable fiscal windfall in the wake of welfare reform. Recall that the federal government agreed in 1996 to fund TANF at levels (for each state) equaling federal payments for AFDC benefits in the year preceding implementation of TANF. Because the rolls dropped markedly in most states, they possessed millions of dollars of excess resources that could be used to assist welfare populations, whether in their benefits or in programs to help them leave the rolls. (No one had anticipated the sheer size of this windfall.) Unfortunately, many states did not spend their windfall—or failed to develop innovative programs to help welfare recipients enter the economic and social mainstream. The Oppression of Persons of Color and the Attack on Afﬁrmative Action During Clinton’s first term, policies to help persons of color came under increasing political attack. In California, Governor Pete Wilson, who was contemplating a run for the presidency, pledged to end affirmative action policies in the state. At his initiative, affirmative action was rescinded in the University of California system; he also supported a proposition on the California ballot in 1996 to end affirmative action throughout state government. Since their introduction, affirmative action policies had allowed many persons of color and women to obtain jobs, education, and government contracts, even if beneficiaries sometimes came from middle- class, rather than poor, families. However, the perception that white claimants were being denied positions and opportunities prompted massive public resentment. Many civil rights advocates feared the erosion of job and college gains by persons of color if the government abandoned affirmative action altogether. Others feared that fundamental changes in the nation’s economy—in particular, the growing importance of higher education and technical skills—would imperil the employment opportunities of African Americans and Latinos. At the same time, influential books by conservative intellectuals disparaged government policies to provide special assistance to persons of color. In The Bell Curve , Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray asserted that African Americans are genetically predisposed to low intelligence. * While many social scientists criticized the methodology and data used by Herrnstein and Murray, the book became a best-seller, and some readers came to believe that the authors had proved their assertion by using advanced social science statistics and methodology. In The End of Racism , Dinesh D’Souza alleged that “cultural dysfunctionality,” not racism, is the main reason that African Americans lag behind the rest of the population economically. * Contending that affirmative action, as well as programs such as AFDC, institutionalized a culture of dependency among African Americans, D’Souza suggested that “race-neutral” policies, including the abandonment of affirmative action, would promote entrepreneurialism and the work ethic among African Americans. Though these two books implicated different causes, they came to the same conclusion: African Americans’ economic status and educational performance derived from personal characteristics, whether their intelligence or their character, rather than from institutionalized racism or other social obstacles. From a social policy perspective, both books provided simplistic analyses of complex phenomena. If African Americans are genetically or culturally inferior, why has a large African American middle (and upper) class developed in the decades after the 1960s—that is, since the enactment of civil rights laws and opportunity-creating social programs, the mass migration of African Americans from rural to urban areas, and the use of affirmative action? Might not the low economic status of many African Americans be, in large part, a consequence of their segregation in rural Southern areas until relatively recently? Might it be linked to the disinclination of banks to allow African Americans to obtain mortgages to purchase houses—a main source of wealth among white Americans? Even if there has been a decline in the overt racism that was endemic until the early 1960s, do other, more subtle forms of racism persist, as reflected in a pervasive bias by employers against African American candidates? And might these prejudices flourish if government pressure and protections were to be removed? Finally, if African Americans are characterized by permanent intellectual deficits, why do numerous pilot projects, as well as research on well-established job training, Head Start, and educational programs, suggest that government intervention can improve the educational and economic standing of African Americans? And why were African Americans achieving upward mobility faster than whites by 2017? Most disturbing, The Bell Curve and The End of Racism lead us toward a fatalistic outlook on social policy. If impoverished African Americans possess character and intellectual deficits that are relatively intractable, government (or society) can play little role in helping them (see Insert 10.4 ). Insert 10.4. Apply Knowledge of Human Behavior and the Social Environment Critique the theory of The Bell Curve using your knowledge of human behavior and the social environment. Do you think that the values of the writers strongly shaped their conclusions? The debate over affirmative action intensified with the passage of Proposition 209 in California in 1997, which forbade public universities from displaying any preference for persons of color in their admissions processes. (The proposition won by a landslide vote.) Because the social class of test takers correlates with their scores on the Student Achievement Test (SAT) and because fewer persons of color have taken and passed advanced placement tests in specific subjects, opponents of Proposition 209 predicted a marked decline in enrollments in California’s public universities by persons of color—a prediction that proved correct when freshman minority enrollment halved in 1998 and when minority enrollment plummeted in public professional schools and in graduate programs. By decreasing a population that was already underrepresented in the ranks of college graduates and the professions, this proposition was viewed by many as arresting those gains that had been painstakingly made toward increasing rates of higher education among persons of color. In the words of Jerome Karabel, a leading authority on affirmative action, Proposition 209 was “the biggest negative redistribution of educational opportunity in the history of the country.” * Opponents of affirmative action sought passage of similar propositions in other states and initiated lawsuits against many affirmative action programs on the grounds that they violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Despite its immediate negative outcomes, Proposition 209 forced policy makers to give more attention to enhanced educational programs for persons of color in secondary schools—emphases that ought to have accompanied affirmative action from the outset. Indeed, the state legislature authorized $38.5 million to expand the pool of eligible minority students by enriching the curriculum and providing special tutoring to African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, and other minority students in the public secondary schools. * Some community colleges developed special enriched programs for minority students so that they could move into public universities once they had completed 2 years of coursework. A healthy debate commenced, as well, about the admissions criteria of universities. The Mexican American Legal Defense Fund (MALDEF) sued California’s public universities on the grounds that it was unfair to emphasize scores on advanced placement tests in the admissions process when few advanced placement tests were even offered in schools attended by most Latino students. Feminist groups brought suit against the College Board Testing Service on grounds that females tended to have lower scores on the Student Achievement Test than did men, alleging that subtle biases existed in the tests or the testing procedures. Another debate swirled around affirmative action: What should be the relative emphasis accorded social class versus membership in a specific minority group? Although a disproportionate number of Latino applicants come from the lowest two economic quintiles, for example, some are children of middle- and upper-class parents just as some white applicants come from low-income families in impoverished areas such as Appalachian communities and in coal-mining rural areas with high levels of poverty. Should priority be given to applicants from low-income backgrounds regardless of their ethnicity or gender? Figure 10.2. Details AP Images/Lynsey Addario Welfare recipients try to enter the economic mainstream. One thing was certain: If Americans failed to develop policies that distributed academic credentials and jobs more fairly among different groups in the population, the nation, itself, would ultimately be the loser. It would forfeit the contributions of millions of women and persons of color to decisions and jobs in myriad settings—and accentuate America’s need to import skilled labor from abroad in a technological age. It would increase inequality in income and status between individuals of different ethnic and gender groups, exacerbating alienation and violating the ethical principle of social justice. It would dampen economic growth by diminishing the wealth and productivity of significant portions of the population. The issue of affirmative action was closely linked, as well, to the broader issue of school vouchers, which had been implemented in cities such as Chicago and Cleveland, as well as in the state of Minnesota. Pointing to troubled public school systems, proponents of vouchers—citing the ethical principle of autonomy—contended that low-income parents ought to be able to send their children to private schools if they wished. Why not, they contended, publicly subsidize vouchers to enable parents to purchase educational services wherever they wished? Opponents countered that public funding of church-related schools, such as parochial schools, violated the Constitutional separation of church and state. (Children were required to attend prayer and religious sessions in parochial and most other sectarian schools.) They contended, as well, that taxpayers were unwilling to fund vouchers at levels that allowed low-income parents a full range of choice, usually forcing them to select low-tuition parochial schools if they could even gain admission to them because of fierce competition for limited slots. Why not, opponents asked, use the voucher funds to improve existing public schools? Several court rulings declared vouchers to be unconstitutional by mid-2000. The Charter School Expansion Act of 1998 established charter schools through amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1994—and was supported by Clinton. Whether not-for-profit or for-profit schools, they came to compete with public schools as we discuss in the next chapter . We have already discussed how Clinton negatively impacted persons of color and low-income whites by enactment of TANF that terminated the AFDC welfare program. He also greatly increased the incarceration rates of African Americans by increasing sentences on crack cocaine as compared to powder cocaine that was widely used by white drug users. The Oppression of Immigrants As we discussed in Chapters 4 and 5 , anti-immigrant sentiment has often grown more strident during periods of economic uncertainty. This pattern continued in the 1990s, when corporate downsizing and globalization brought economic insecurity and anxiety to many American homes. In 1994, California voters passed Proposition 187, which declared illegal aliens ineligible for medical, social, and educational services. Though its implementation was halted pending the outcome of court challenges and appeals, this law nonetheless triggered a national debate about immigration. The immigrant population can be divided into three groups: “legal immigrants” with visas or other documents from federal immigration officials, so-called undocumented or illegal immigrants, and immigrants with uncertain legal status who fall between these two categories. Large numbers of legal immigrants have resided in the United States for years or even decades, dutifully paying Social Security payroll taxes, Medicare payroll taxes, federal taxes, and state and local taxes. Whether because they retire, develop disabilities, or have low income, immigrants often need benefits from social programs like SSI, Medicaid, and Food Stamps—programs that they have helped fund through their taxes. Betraying their prejudice even against legal immigrants, the Republican majority placed an array of restrictive policies in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Act of 1996, including giving states the option of terminating legal immigrants from Medicaid and exempting legal immigrants who had worked for less than 10 years in the United States from eligibility for SSI and Food Stamps. California’s Proposition 187, enacted in 1994, banned illegal immigrants from participating in any state-funded programs and Medicaid, as well as use of public schools by their children. (It passed by a landslide vote despite determined opposition by many liberals and Latinos.) Republicans took a particularly hard stand on immigration in 1996 because they perceived the issue to be a wedge issue that could entice moderate and conservative Democrats to vote for the Republican ticket in forthcoming elections, enacting legislation that greatly increased the size of the border patrol and that made it more difficult for illegal immigrants to obtain legal status. (Some favored federal legislation to ban illegal immigrants from using federal programs.) Opponents of harsh policies toward undocumented immigrants insisted that they made extraordinary economic contributions to the United States, often filling positions in agriculture, restaurants, hotels, and elsewhere that American citizens did not want while often paying payroll and income taxes. They contended, as well, that denying undocumented workers access to medical programs was not only ethically misguided, but it could cause epidemics of diseases like tuberculosis and AIDS that could affect the broader population. Denial of education to the children of undocumented workers would force them to roam the streets, possibly increasing gang and criminal activity. A 1996 immigration law required immigrants with uncertain legal status to return to their countries of origin to apply for permanent U.S. visas while also not allowing them to return to the United States in the interim. Many of these immigrants, moreover, were subject to denials of Food Stamps, SSI, and Medicaid that had been placed on legal immigrants in the 1996 welfare reform legislation. The hostile national mood toward these three kinds of immigrants began receding by 1997, however, for several reasons. * Most importantly, the huge Spanish-speaking population in the United States was angered by immigrant bashing as many of them had been immigrants or were sympathetic with them. (Republicans lost a landslide gubernatorial election in California in 1998 partly because they had authored Proposition 187— and presidential candidate Bob Dole lost Florida to Bill Clinton in the presidential election of 1996 partly because he had supported anti- immigrant legislation. * ) The booming economy diminished prejudice against immigrants among those citizens who had been fearful they would take their jobs. Aware that immigration no longer was suitable as a wedge to divide the Democratic Party, Republicans backed off the issue. As the hostile mood abated, some restrictive policies were modified. * Proposition 187 was never implemented because of legal injunctions and adverse court rulings. Beating a hasty retreat, the Congress restored SSI and Medicaid in 1997 for legal immigrants who had been in the United States since August of 1996, while restoring Food Stamp benefits in 1998. (It also allowed immigrants whose legal status was unclear to be permanently eligible for SSI and Medicaid in 1997.) Moreover, Congress gave special considerations to refugees from repressive regimes in Cuba, Haiti, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua—and immigration officials doubled the number of visas granted to immigrants with computer, engineering, or other special skills needed by American corporations. The Oppression of Children Knowing that Hillary Clinton was a former board member of the Children’s Defense Fund, children’s advocates hoped for major legislation to further their goals during Clinton’s first term. Some marginal gains were made; for example, a nationwide immunization program for children was initiated, and Congress approved $1 billion for demonstration programs in local jurisdictions to strengthen troubled families. However, major policy changes proposed by the Republican-controlled Congress—including the elimination of entitlement status for AFDC, the block-granting of food stamps, and revision of Medicaid policies to end the phased inclusion of children over age 12—threatened to cast even lar ger numbers of children into poverty. The drawbacks of indiscriminate block-granting are well illustrated by child welfare. In 1996, 21 states were under court supervision for failing to properly care for children in child protective services and in foster care. Social workers, who have often been blamed for failing to detect child abuse or neglect, typically carried caseloads exceeding 50 cases, although the Child Welfare League of America, a respected private organization, recommended no more than 15. Many states, straining to meet the budgetary demands of education, Medicaid, and prisons, failed sufficiently to augment federal subsidies with their own resources. Yet Republicans insisted that the $4 billion in federal subsidies for child welfare be given as block grants to the states, which could administer them with few restrictions. They tried to include block granting of child welfare in welfare reform legislation of 1996, but they were defeated by a bipartisan coalition. When they enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Act of 1996, most legislators focused not on the well-being of children but on methods of reducing the welfare rolls as rapidly as possible. Few of them even wondered if the earnings of former recipients would be sufficient to reduce rates of childhood poverty or whether reduced income of some formal recipients (as compared with their prior income plus in-kind benefits) would increase rates of child abuse and neglect or whether rates of families’ homelessness would increase. Some early findings offered grounds for caution in the fall of 1999. A study of census data by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities showed that, although “the average earnings and overall incomes of low-income female-headed families rose substantially between 1993 and 1995 as the economy expanded … the average incomes of the poorest 20% of female-headed families with children fell from 1995 to 1997 despite economic growth, as welfare system changes took effect on a large scale.…” * The welfare reform legislation restricted eligibility to SSI for children with behavioral disorders even though Congress agreed in 1997 to continue Medicaid benefits to children that lost their SSI eligibility. (It also disqualified adults whose primary disability is substance abuse or alcoholism.) It decreased funding for meals of children in family day care homes, as well as cut reimbursements for summer food programs—and eliminated start-up and expansion funding of the School Breakfast Program. The welfare reform legislation eliminated the guarantee of child care for welfare recipients trying to move into employment that existed under AFDC, leaving it to individual states to determine whether and for how long former recipients received subsidized child care. * It did, however, consolidate federal child care programs under the existing Child Care and Development Block Grant and increase funding through a new child care block grant. It also allowed states to transfer up to 30% of their TANF block grant funds to the Child Care and Development Block Grant and the Title XX Social Services Block Grant. Clinton signed, as well, the Adoption and Safe Families Act that was designed to hasten adoptions of children in foster care. If the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 had aimed to reduce the number of children in foster care by imposing regulations on the states and expanding child welfare services, it had emphasized protection of the rights of natural families, strongly affirming reunification with natural families whenever possible. In the ensuing two decades, however, sentiment slowly shifted toward emphasizing whatever disposition would protect the children’s well-being and safety—including adoptions instead of reunification in instances when clear patterns of child abuse had existed in the natural family. (Disillusionment with the possibility of reunification for many children was reinforced, moreover, by the growing numbers of children in foster care, totaling roughly 500,000 in 1997, with many of them in foster care for more than 2 years.) The Adoption and Safe Families Act sought to double the number of adoptions of children in foster care from 27,000 children in 1996 to 54,000 in the near future by stating that reunification need not even be attempted if a child was subjected to “aggravated circumstances” like serious physical abuse or if parents had killed or assaulted another child; offering $4,000 to each state for every adoption that exceeded its previous annual total; requiring states to terminate parental rights and to begin adoption proceedings once a child had been in foster care for 15 of the preceding 22 months; and stipulating that children were entitled to judicial hearings within 12 months of entering foster care rather than 18 months in existing law. * Even the Family Preservation Program, which was created by the 1993 budget reconciliation law to provide impetus to family reunification, was mandated to promote adoptions as well as reunification and was renamed the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program. The Oppression of Gay Men and Lesbians A policy controversy during Clinton’s first months in office illustrated the continuing discrimination against gay men and lesbians. Clinton had made a campaign promise to end the military’s homophobic policies, under which candidates known to be gay men or lesbians were denied admission and military personnel who came out as gay or lesbian or were determined to have engaged in homosexual acts were dismissed. (About 14,000 people had been dismissed under these rules between 1983 and 1993; roughly 25% were women.) Most military leaders opposed any change in policy on the grounds that gay and lesbian personnel undermined unit cohesion by alienating their heterosexual peers. However, a U.S. District Court judge had ordered the Navy to reinstate Keith Meinhold, who had been discharged after identifying himself as a gay man on national television. Caught between military leaders and conservatives on the one hand, and gay and lesbian activists on the other, Clinton fashioned an initial compromise in which the existing policy would remain in place for six months, pending consultation with military leaders, but all actions against gay men and lesbians would be suspended, unless they had been charged with homosexual conduct. Unwilling to await the president’s resolution, Democratic Senator Sam Nunn held extended hearings on the issue. Nunn advanced a “don’t ask and don’t tell” approach, under which military leaders would be prevented from questioning recruits or personnel about their sexual orientation but could still dismiss personnel who identified themselves as gay men or lesbians, engaged in homosexual acts, or sought to marry a person of the same gender. This compromise enraged many gay men and lesbians because sexual orientation remained sufficient cause for dismissal, regardless of the individual’s job-related proficiency. When the president accepted a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach, Senator Sam Nunn pushed for legislation that contained even more restrictive language—for example, the declaration that those who “demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would create an unacceptable risk” to military standards. Placed in a military authorization bill, Clinton’s compromise with Nunn’s tougher wording was finally codified into law as part of a military authorization bill in November 1993. * Data suggested in 1999 that the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy had had virtually no effect in reducing the number of dismissals of gays and lesbians from the military. The gay community continued to be plagued by the AIDS epidemic. Although combinations of medications had allowed many infected persons to live, many medical uncertainties remained. Some HIV-positive persons could not tolerate the medications or found their side effects to be unacceptable. As the panic about the epidemic abated, many persons stopped practicing safe sex and rates of infection, after having dropped for several years, began to rise again. The epidemic began to spread to minority communities to the extent that the Board of Supervisors in Los Angeles County declared a state of medical emergency in late 1999, calling for an all-out campaign of HIV education and outreach to arrest its spread, particularly in low-income areas. Recognize the Illustration of Reluctance In the first 2 years of his presidency, Clinton sought relatively liberal policies, including social investments, health reform, and many smaller measures. A combination of forces frustrated his attempts at reform. A resurgent Republican minority in both chambers was able to align with moderate and conservative Democrats who balked at the president’s proposals. Outside of Congress, large numbers of Americans, cynical about government, did not want major social initiatives; they were more interested in putting an end to gridlock, implementing campaign reforms, and achieving a balanced budget. Nor had the electorate given Clinton a mandate; he barely won the election, receiving only 43% of the popular vote. Finally, Clinton and his advisors made many errors of their own during the first 2 years; in particular, the health reform proposal that they developed was far too complex to win broad support. The third year of the Clinton presidency might even be called the Newt Gingrich era, inasmuch as Republicans’ victory in the 1994 elections left them in control of both chambers of Congress and allowed Gingrich to set the legislative agenda. Resorting to a zigzagging retreat by June, Clinton acceded to most of the Republicans’ budget demands as the year proceeded. This third year strongly resembled the politics of 1981, when Ronald Reagan had orchestrated huge cuts in domestic spending—except that the cuts in 1995 were orchestrated not by the president but by a congressional leader. Clinton’s zigzagging strategy proved politically successful in slowing the momentum of conservatives, particularly as they overreached to land a knockout blow to their retreating opponent. Underestimating the tenacity of Clinton, Republicans assumed they could force him to accept their tax and spending cuts in late 1995 by shutting the government down, only to discover that most citizens blamed them for the loss of government LO 10-10 services. If Clinton had been widely viewed as inept and excessively liberal in 1994, leaders such as Gingrich were widely viewed in 1996 as too far to the right and unwilling to compromise. The result was a landslide victory of Clinton over Dole in the 1996 election, even though both Houses of Congress remained in Republican hands. Clinton’s second term was devoid of many large social policy accomplishments because the two parties, as well as the president and Congress, were stalemated and polarized. Domestic discretionary spending remained frozen by caps that were made even more severe by the 1997 budget deal. Military spending again began to rise after falling somewhat in earlier years of the Clinton administration. As in prior years of the Clinton administration, attention focused in 1997 on obtaining a balanced budget by 2002—a focus that inhibited domestic reforms save for a major initiative to provide health insurance to children and various tax entitlements for education. From the vantage point of social policy, Clinton’s presidency was significantly a defensive one with a sprinkling of new and modestly small initiatives. He managed to limit many of the tax and spending cuts that Republicans sought in budget deals of 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. He was able, as well, to end the mega-deficits that the nation had inherited from the Reagan and George H. W. Bush years, thus removing a major constraint to renewed social spending. He defeated conservatives’ efforts to end affirmative action at the federal level and to limit choice by pregnant women. He cleverly thwarted Republicans’ resurgence in the wake of the taking of control of both Houses of Congress in 1994, not only winning a significant victory for himself in 1996 but helping to cut Republicans’ majorities in the House and Senate in 1998. He greatly expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit by raising its eligibility level and subsidies—making it into the largest federal antipoverty program. He expanded Head Start—and secured enactment of a major program to extend health insurance to poor children not eligible for Medicaid. However, Clinton also contributed to liberals’ malaise. While his zigzagging maneuvers kept Republicans off balance from 1995 onward, they also prioritized political expediency over principles on numerous occasions. Essentially a centrist president who could veer to the right on occasion to preempt conservatives’ themes on crime, welfare, military spending, and spending cuts, Clinton failed sufficiently to articulate a progressive vision. He further jeopardized progressive legislation through his ill-advised personal behavior in his second term, which provided conservatives with ammunition to attack Clinton and his policies. From a liberal perspective, then, Clinton had a mixed record. He often warded off conservatives and adroitly got important reforms enacted, but his domestic accomplishments were relatively modest. Domestic discretionary spending actually declined as a percentage of GDP during his tenure—although he got social programs funded by tax expenditures significantly increased, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Hope scholarship funds for college. He assented to caps and freezes on domestic discretionary spending in budget deals of 1993 and 1997. He signed welfare legislation in 1996 even knowing that conservative states would implement it punitively. Developed in 1999, his plan to use trillions of dollars of the impending surplus to reduce the national debt ignored myriad domestic programs that needed new resources. No administration illustrates the battle for resources faced by liberals more dramatically than the Clinton administration. Entire legislative sessions in 1993, 1995, 1996, and 1997 were devoted to budget deals that were (except for 1997) sharply contested—and that is why we discuss them in detail. As we will see, President Obama encountered similar budget battles during his two terms from 2009 to 2017. Bill Clinton came into office facing huge deficits bequeathed to him by the Reagan and Bush administrations. With little money in the till and with the focus on diminishing deficits, Clinton could not develop a robust domestic agenda. Budget deals of 1993 and 1997 froze and capped domestic discretionary spending, meaning that Clinton could fund his small domestic initiatives like AmeriCorps (a kind of domestic Peace Corps) and various educational initiatives only by cutting other domestic programs. Congress scuttled his stimulus spending and social investment proposals in 1993 on the grounds that deficit reduction should be prioritized. His proposal for national health insurance was defeated in 1994 partly because opponents contended the nation could not afford it during a period of high deficits. Clinton deserves credit for securing some initiatives from 1993 through 1999 in this austere fiscal environment. He sometimes resorted to tax expenditures, funding most of his education initiatives “off budget” through the tax code, as well as huge increases in the EITC in 1993. His congressional allies placed preventive social programs in the crime legislation in a kind of backdoor method of funding social programs. He increased the minimum wage and frequently issued federal regulations— strategies not requiring federal expenditures. He secured small child care and job-training additions to welfare reform legislation. Clinton also deserves credit for defeating or diminishing some Republican cuts in social spending, as well as the downsizing of several proposed Republican tax cuts in years such as 1993 and 1997. (Tax cuts often force spending cuts to pay for them.) He was aided by many moderate and liberal legislators, as well as by effective advocacy groups such as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Clinton was able, as well, to reduce the extent to which some tax cuts showered their benefits disproportionately upon affluent Americans, such as with various education tax expenditures that he obtained in 1998. Clinton also deserves some credit for ending the nation’s annual budget deficits—even positioning the nation for trillions of dollars of surpluses that could have been applied to shoring up the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Had this occurred, Americans in succeeding decades would have encountered a less severe budget crunch that posed less of a threat to domestic discretionary spending. (We note in the next three chapters how these large surpluses were soon converted into massive deficits with serious implications for funding social programs and for the nation’s economic health.) It was clear in the 1990s that the United States was a deeply divided nation. If liberals mostly liked Clinton, conservatives detested him and even voted in the House to impeach him. As the presidential election of 2000 approached, everyone wondered if the stalemate of the 1990s would continue into the new millennium.Link Uncertainty during the 1990s to Contemporary Society What W e Can Learn from Policy Advocates of the 1990s EP 5c EP 7a EP 8d Most attention has been given in policy advocacy to proposing, amending, or blocking specific legislative proposals. The presidency of Bill Clinton graphically illustrates the importance of the budget process in federal, state, and local jurisdictions. We may get meritorious legislation enacted, but without adequate funding it won’t achieve its goals. Social worker Barbara Ann Mikulski exemplifies a policy advocate who sought out a key position on the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. Senate when she was elected to it in the late 1980s (see Insert 10.5 ). Insert 10.5. Proﬁles in Policy Practice and Advocacy: Social W orker Barbara Ann Mikulski, LO 10-11 United States Representative (1977–1987) and United States Senator (1987–2016) Barbara Ann Mikulski—social worker, social activist, crusader for women’s rights, and politician—has been described as earthy, flamboyant, feisty, and outspoken. She describes herself as a “progressive populist” and “a cross between Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry Truman,” and said she was going to Washington, DC, “to raise hell.” Indeed, Mikulski’s political career has been devoted to promoting reform, despite the challenges this type of leadership inevitably faces. Mikulski was born in Baltimore, MD, on July 20, 1936, to William and Christine Eleanor (Kutz) Mikulski. She grew up in Highlandtown, one of Baltimore’s ethnic and working-class neighborhoods, where her parents ran a grocery store. There, she attended Sacred Heart of Jesus elementary school and the Institute of Notre Dame High School. When she wasn’t in school, Mikulski worked in the family’s store alongside her mother and father. In 1958, Mikulski received a B.A. in social work from Mount Saint Agnes College (now a part of Loyola University). After graduation, she began working as a caseworker for several agencies in Baltimore, including the Associated Catholic Charities, the Department of Social Services, and the York Family Agency. Meanwhile, she took evening courses at the University of Maryland toward a master’s degree in social work, which she received in 1965. Armed with her new degree, Mikulski took a job teaching at VISTA training center and worked for REASON (Responding to the Elderly’s Ability and Sickness Otherwise Neglected), Narcotics Anonymous, and other community projects. Shortly after launching her career in social work, Mikulski became aware of her political consciousness. Her one-on-one work with people led her to realize that, in many cases, institutions were the cause of many of her clients’ problems. She became increasingly involved in the civil rights movement and fought for residential desegregation in Baltimore while working in the Kennedy and Johnson campaigns. At age 27, she shocked her parents, who believed children should live at home until they were married, by moving into her own apartment in an integrated area of Baltimore. Her parents, who were aware of her involvement in the civil rights movement, often brought it to Mikulski’s attention that there were people in her old neighborhood who needed her help as much as anyone else. Moreover, the people who lived in her old neighborhood often felt as though African Americans were “getting everything” as a result of civil rights legislation. In a 1970 interview in America , Mikulski responded to those charges by saying, “… I know that black programs were token efforts … The result was that the two groups [African Americans and the Polish Americans living in her old neighborhood] were turned against each other instead of the system.” By the end of 1968, Mikulski had experienced the two incidents that were the catalysts of her full transformation from social worker to social activist: the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. These tragic events not only left her angry and confused but also inspired her to undergo a complete change of her life. At first, she sought answers through more study at Mount Saint Agnes College in 1969 and in the field of urban affairs at Baltimore Community College from 1970 to 1971. She also continued her social work at various agencies in Baltimore. But after all her searching, Mikulski finally determined that political activism was the solution. Moving back to her old neighborhood, she helped found the Southeast Baltimore Organization, a coalition of Polish, Italian, African American, and Lumbee Indian groups. Mikulski’s first major achievement came when, under her leadership, the organization successfully campaigned to stop the construction of a proposed freeway that would have necessitated tearing down 400 homes of retired and elderly persons in the neighborhood. Shortly thereafter, the organization started a neighborhood restoration project and persuaded the city to develop a park in their community. Inspired by her success in the organization, by 1971 Mikulski was ready to take her political ambitions to the next level. With the help of her parents, who distributed flyers with the weekly grocery specials saying, “Please vote for our daughter,” Mikulski’s image as a liberal reformer, and her door-to-door campaign, she won a seat on the Baltimore City Council. During her tenure on the council, she was instrumental in introducing legislation to create the Commission on Aging and Retirement Education (CARE), which had as its main purpose the reduction of bus fares for the elderly and the establishment of a commission to study the impact of rape on its victims. Councilwoman Mikulski’s political style and message quickly gained national attention. In 1976, 2 years after losing her first congressional election to Charles Mathias, Jr., Mikulski, who had won reelection in 1975 to the Baltimore City Council, was elected to represent Maryland’s 3rd Congressional District. Once in Congress, she quickly became the first woman appointed to the powerful Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, whose actions were extremely important to the Baltimore port. Congresswoman Mikulski consistently supported Democratic proconsumer legislation, including strict regulation of the energy industry and price controls. Never losing sight of her social work background, Mikulski was one of many who passionately opposed Ronald Reagan’s cutbacks in social spending. In 1983, she told Working Woman that “If the government truly wants to nourish the family, it must give the family what it needs,” including decent jobs, access to education, and access to health care. Her relentless attacks against Reagan’s social spending cuts led many in Congress to conclude that perhaps she really had gone to Washington, DC, to raise hell. Mikulski was reelected to the House of Representatives four times in succession before being elected to the Senate in 1986. As a U.S. Senator, Mikulski has sat on the Appropriations Committee, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and the Small Business Committee. She has also chaired the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies. Even before she was elected to the Senate, she demonstrated her interest in budget issues when she assumed a leadership role in the U.S. House of Representatives in attacking proposed cuts in social spending by President Ronald Reagan. States, too, will face major budget shortfalls in coming decades. They must fund the pensions of government workers. They have to fund states’ share of Medicaid costs, which currently amount to more than 25% of the budgets of many states. They must fund the growing cost of prisons and correctional programs. If they wish to equalize expenditures on schools used by low-income students, states must dramatically increase expenditures on public education. In both federal and state legislatures, budget politics will often erupt into conflict between conservatives and liberals. As during the presidency of Bill Clinton, conservatives will often insist that taxes be cut or not raised—and they will often support tax cuts, particularly for relatively affluent persons and corporations. They will often seek cuts in spending on social programs while favoring increases in spending on the military and correctional programs. Liberals will be more likely to take divergent positions on these tax and spending issues from conservatives—seeking tax increases on relatively affluent persons while favoring greater spending on many social programs. If they seek to advance the ethical principle of social justice, policy advocates won’t have the luxury of standing on the sidelines in these conflicts over taxes and spending. Conflict over budget priorities reemerged in the presidencies of Barack Obama and Donald Trump as we discuss in Chapters 12 and 13 . As we have seen in this chapter, budget politics can be relatively complex because of jargon, budgeting procedures, and budget data. Such national budget advocacy groups as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities help us understand specific budget issues—and similar budget advocacy groups exist in most state capitols. What W e Can Learn from the Persistence of Unmet Needs and Policy Issues during the 1990s The lack of resources for discretionary social spending was a key issue in the 1990s as the Clinton administration struggled to cut the nation’s budget deficits while also fending off some huge tax cuts proposed by Republicans. The United States will face relatively harsh budgetary realities in coming decades in what could even be a “perfect storm” of fiscal shortages as revealed by an imbalance between revenues and expenditures . Revenues are primarily provided at the national level by the federal income tax on individuals and corporations, but the United States had the lowest tax rates of any industrialized nation as it entered the 21st century—tax rates that were lowered yet further during the presidency of George W. Bush as he succeeded in getting Congress to enact trillions of dollars of new tax cuts. President Donald Trump proposed tax cuts in 2017, as well as increases in military spending, that would, if enacted, dry up resources for the domestic agenda. On the expenditure side of the federal budget, the following factors will greatly increase the cost of the federal government in coming decades: The aging of the baby boomers (persons born between 1946 and 1964) will vastly increase federal spending on Social Security pensions, Medicare, Medicaid, and Supplementary Security Income (SSI) as the number of persons over age 65 increases from 12.4% in 2000 to 19.6% in 2030. In turn, baby boomers’ Social Security pensions and their health costs (funded primarily by Medicare and Medicaid) will vastly rise. Funds required to finance the nation’s debt will rise dramatically to the extent that budget deficits accumulated in the presidency of George W. Bush will continue into the future. Increased funding will be needed for pensions of retired federal workers. The cost of Medicaid for nonelderly persons—which has already surpassed Medicare in size—will continue to rise dramatically if the cost of health care continues to outpace inflation. The cost of military spending will remain high if the United States continues to be the preeminent military power in the world—and it will continue to compete head-to-head with domestic discretionary spending since it is funded from the discretionary portion of the federal budget. The cost of health care for veterans of the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq will increase. The cost of environmental damage from global warming will become increasingly apparent, as will the cost of converting from a petroleum- based economy to an economy that produces far less carbon dioxide. What W e Can Learn from Failed Policy Strategies of the 1990s It is true that welfare rolls declined by 50% (or more) in many states in the decade following the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Act of 1996. Welfare reform was a dramatic success if “success” is measured by the size of welfare rolls. It is also true that some women not only entered the workforce far faster than would have been the case without welfare reform—and some of them climbed the economic ladder so that they and their families were no longer below or near official poverty lines. For most single heads of household, however, welfare reform was not a success because they remained under or near official poverty lines. Many of them worked two or even three jobs, leaving them physically and mentally exhausted as they also parented their children. Moreover, roughly half of women on welfare rolls remained on those rolls because of personal disabilities (such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia) or because one or more of their children had physical or mental disabilities. No panaceas exist, but the nation might have at least provided free and quality child care to single heads of household, continuing medical coverage, and subsidized transportation. In addition to providing these amenities, the nation could have greatly increased the availability of free education so that single heads of household could not only have completed high school, but enrolled in community and 4-year colleges. Still afflicted with a poorhouse mentality, many public officials from both political parties continue to view single heads of household as victimized by defects of character rather than persons who need amenities that more affluent persons take for granted. What W e Can Learn from Promising Strategies of the 1990s Several policy initiatives of President Bill Clinton demonstrated that government can and should help working persons of moderate means. He greatly increased tax benefits and eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which gives a tax rebate to families with working parents of moderate income. He enacted HOPE scholarships so that parents with less than $50,000 for a single parent or $100,000 for two parents could also get tax rebates up to $1,500 for the first 2 years of postsecondary education, Lifetime Learning Credits for students in college or graduate school that would provide up to $1,000 per year of education with income eligibility similar to HOPE scholarships, and education savings accounts in which parents could set aside up to $500 per year that could be withdrawn tax free when their children were in college. Both the EITC and the HOPE scholarships illustrate that policies that help persons thrive in the economy should be a strong part of the American welfare state. Although people often require assistance with their immediate health and welfare needs, they also need policies that provide them with employment-related skills (the HOPE scholarships) and policies that help them improve their economic well-being in job markets (the EITC). It is not difficult to identify other policies that should be considered or amplified, such as loan and grant programs to help citizens purchase houses, start small businesses, and obtain job training. The ethical principle of social justice, which often focuses on desperately poor people, ought also to include families with moderate means that cannot afford basic amenities like education or health care. What We Can Learn from the 1990s about the Structure of the American W elfare State Our discussion of HOPE scholarships and the EITC illustrates the “hidden” side of the American welfare state—tax credits, deductions, deferrals, and exemptions. All told, this hidden side represents more than $600 billion (as of 2008) in government spending each year, since these hidden resources cost the government precisely what they would cost if they were appropriated resources (rather than tax concessions) for programs like Head Start. When engaging in micro policy advoccacy, then, social workers should be adept at informing their clients about these hidden resources, which many clients do not use because they do not know about them or understand how to use them. In the case of the EITC—now the largest federal antipoverty program for nonelderly persons—as many as 50% of eligible families fail to apply for its considerable benefits.

The nation was polarized between the two major parties in the presidential elections of 1992 and 1996, with both parties hoping to achieve a solid majority by capturing moderate or swing voters. Many social policies hung in the balance, as well as what would happen to the huge budget surpluses that had finally replaced the large deficits of the 1980s and 2004 Bush supports constitutional amendment against gay marriages in February 2004 Bush defeats John Kerry in the presidential race ; Republicans get majorities in both chambers of Congress 2006 Democrats win most congressional elections , giving them a solid majority in the House and a one-vote majority in the Senate 2007 Candidates seeking the nomination of their parties for the presidency emerge 2007 Supreme Court with conservative majority makes key rulings 2007 As in 2006, Congress fails to enact immigration legislation 2007 Congress enacts major expansion of S/CHIP medical insurance for children but Bush vetoes it 2008 As the nation heads toward presidential primaries , Hillary Clinton leads Democratic contenders , with no clear leader emerging among Republican contenders 1990s. Would the Democrats, who had finally won the presidency in 1992 after 12 years of Republican control, hold onto the presidency and perhaps gain control in one or more Houses of Congress? Or would Republicans regain the presidency and keep their control over Congress? Would either party break the nation’s deadlock by gaining a decisive advantage? What consequences would electoral outcomes have for vulnerable populations as well as other citizens? Discuss Bush’ s Ambitious Goal EP 1a EP 2c EP 5a The Democrats seemed to be in the ascendancy in the mid-1960s: Save for brief periods, they had controlled both houses of Congress since the New Deal as well as the presidency with the exception of Eisenhower’s two terms. By the 1970s and 1980s, many Republican strategists hungered for “realignment” to achieve for the Republicans what Franklin Roosevelt had brought the Democrats: control of Congress and the presidency, as well as the Supreme Court for three decades. Their hopes depended on getting Southern voters and many blue-collar voters to shift from the Democratic to the Republican Party. Republicans made some progress in the 1970s under President Nixon and huge progress in the 1980s under President Reagan when they regained control of the presidency and controlled the Senate for 6 years. They regained control of the House, as well as the Senate, in the congressional elections of 1994. Moreover, with the selection of Clarence Thomas, William Rehnquist, and Anthony Scalia, Republicans obtained a conservative cadre in the Supreme Court that was able to obtain many conservative rulings by teaming with moderate jurists. Many Republicans were not satisfied with their progress, however, as Bill Clinton neared the end of his two terms in 1999. Democrats had not only won the presidency in the Clinton years, but had fought Republicans to a LO 11-1 standstill in Congress while securing the appointment of a liberal jurist, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to the Supreme Court. Federal spending had continued to increase in the 1980s and 1990s; affirmative action was still in effect in many places; women still had the right to obtain abortions; many safety net programs (including Food Stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and Medicaid) held their ground and were not devolved to the states; and huge federal entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid grew at a remarkable pace. Smaller than the welfare states of many other nations when measured as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), the American welfare state had nonetheless grown substantially since the late 1960s. * Karl Rove, a Republican political consultant in Texas, had dreamed of realignment from the 1970s onward. Working with other Republicans, he had helped transform Texas from a Democratic to a Republican state over a period of decades. Often working for George Herbert Walker Bush as a political consultant, he had became well acquainted with the Bush family over a period of decades—and had viewed the eldest son, George Walker Bush, as a likely candidate for the presidency as early as the 1970s. Even then, Rove fancied himself as filling the same role for Bush as Mark Hanna had for President William McKinley in 1896 when he not only helped him get elected, but ushered in a three-decade period of Republican control of national politics. Little did Rove realize in the 1970s that he would have this chance in the year 2000 when he became Bush’s chief political consultant—a position he retained in succeeding years as well. A master of hardball politics that included tactics of questionable morality and the raising of huge sums of money, Rove would inject his perspectives into Bush’s presidential campaigns and the running of the White House. * The younger Bush grew up in a privileged home in West Texas, where his father was an affluent oilman. In a frontier town and a state with a conservative ethos and few social programs, George W. Bush came to believe that voluntary organizations, church-related charities, and rugged individualism could solve or avert most social ills. Bush was socialized to conservatism from an early age. His father ran on the conservative ethos of Barry Goldwater in his race for the Senate in 1964, even opposing civil rights legislation and the enactment of Medicare. George W. Bush avidly read Goldwater’s book Conscience of a Conservative when his father gave it to him in high school. * If Bush was socialized to conservatism from an early age, he also learned from his father that conservative Republicans risked political defeat if they were too conservative. His father attributed Goldwater’s landslide defeat in 1964, for example, to his hard-right views, contending that Republicans would be unsuccessful if they were not “responsible conservatives.” * George W. Bush was convinced that the decade of the 1960s had corrupted American values. He believed it had ushered in the drug culture, far-left political ideology, a runaway welfare state, and secularism. He was shocked when William Sloan Coffin, a liberal chaplain at Yale University, told him that his father deserved a recent defeat in a political race against a liberal protagonist because “… your father lost to a better man.” * Bush’s views about the 1960s were diametrically opposed to liberals’ views. If Bush perceived the decade in negative terms, liberals viewed the protests, social movements, and policy reforms of the era as an overdue response to major social problems such as poverty and discrimination against African Americans. (They also condemned some excesses of the decade, including tactics of the radical left Weathermen that included bombings and bank robberies.) Bush followed in his father’s footsteps by attending an elite private school in New England, graduating from Yale, becoming a Navy pilot in the National Guard, and returning to Midland, Texas, in 1977 to seek his fortune in oil drilling. Unlike his father, Bush was not highly successful. While his father had been a highly successful athlete, student, war hero, and oilman, Bush had few triumphs on any of these fronts. He was an alcoholic during portions of the 1970s and early 1980s—only quitting “cold turkey” in 1986 when he realized it was holding him back. * (He had converted to Christian fundamentalism in 1985 under the influence of evangelist Billy Graham.) Bush was influenced in the 1980s and 1990s by the writings of three intellectuals who had recently converted to conservatism from liberal views: Marvin Olasky, David Horowitz, and Myron Magnet. Olasky, who had converted from Judaism and liberal ideology to Christian fundamentalism, contended that the welfare reforms of the 1960s had blunted the work ethic of low-income Americans. Much like Reagan, he wanted to return the United States to the values and policies of the late 19th century, when churches and church-related organizations had dominated social welfare. He believed that volunteers, not social work professionals, should be the primary purveyors of assistance to needy persons, often using spiritual guidance as part of their interventions. * David Horowitz and Myron Magnet shared similar views, though they acknowledged more than Olasky did that the work of nongovernment agencies had to be supplemented with residual government programs when the private sector lacked sufficient resources to meet the needs of deserving citizens, as illustrated by programs to avert malnutrition. * Often using poor grammar and uninterested in books, Bush was viewed by many observers as lacking the intellect to emulate his father’s success. Bush was widely underestimated, however. Unlike his patrician father, he loved the rough-and-tumble nature of political races. He participated in his father’s political campaigns of 1964, 1966, 1970, 1988, and 1992. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1978. He helped a conservative win a Senate seat in 1972 in Florida. Lee Atwater—a well-known Republican political consultant who often used unsavory tactics in his campaigns—tutored him in election strategy when he worked with Atwater in his father’s presidential race in 1988, Bush had a gregarious personality that allowed him to communicate successfully with persons of all social classes. By the mid-1980s, Bush had all of the key attributes needed to be a successful candidate. He had become a savvy political tactician from his participation in many campaigns; indeed, Mary Matalin, a top Republican strategist, called him a fully formed “political campaign terrorist” who is “not as ham-handed as the typical (political) terrorist” but “more of a stiletto as opposed to an ax murderer.” * He had access to large sums of money through his family’s connections with corporate and affluent elites, as well as high name recognition stemming from his father’s and grandfather’s high-profile positions in the public sector. He was highly motivated to succeed in politics. Often compared disparagingly to his father, he wanted to prove his own merit. Having converted to fundamentalist Christianity, Bush believed God intended him to restore traditional values. Viewing liberal reforms and liberal eras, such as the 1960s, negatively, he wanted to move the nation in conservative directions. With formidable political skills, he was confident that he could ultimately win higher office (see Insert 11.1 ). Insert 11.1.

Then find an analysis of such funding by doing a Web search on “faith-based charity.” On balance, do you support or oppose this policy? Bush was also an admirer of Ronald Reagan’s ideas. He accepted Reagan’s supply-side economic strategy of giving investors, corporations, and affluent persons large tax cuts in order to stimulate job-creating investments —a policy derisively called “trickle-down economics” by many liberals. He agreed with Reagan’s strategy to deplete resources that might otherwise be used to fund government programs and liberal reforms by creating large government deficits. He agreed with Reagan’s huge increases in military spending. Like Reagan, he was convinced that Republicans could become the major American political party, relegating Democrats to a minority status. Bush lacked a key attribute of many successful political candidates, however: a track record of his own. His dabbling in oil exploration in Midland in the 1970s and 1980s had been relatively unsuccessful. He had avoided service in Vietnam by using his father’s connections to get into the Air National Guard. He was defeated in his only run for political office. Partly to demonstrate that he could be a successful businessman, Bush became a part owner and executive officer of the Texas Rangers, a Dallas- based baseball team in 1989. He considered running for the governorship of Texas in 1990, but was dissuaded by his mother on the grounds that the race might be seen as a referendum on his father’s performance as president. With his father’s defeat by Bill Clinton in 1992, Bush decided to seek the governorship of Texas as a stepping stone to the presidency. Polls indicated that many moderate and conservative Texas voters viewed Ann Richards, the incumbent liberal governor, as too liberal. With Rove as his primary consultant, Bush fashioned a clever campaign against Richards in 1994 that emphasized four issues: having greater local control of schools, trying many juvenile offenders as adults, reducing welfare rolls, and limiting damage awards in liability suits. As was true in many campaigns where Rove was a political consultant, the Bush campaign used negative tactics, such as insinuating that Richards had close connections with homosexuals and lesbians and that she would confiscate guns in a state where most citizens opposed gun control. * After defeating Richards, Bush became governor in a state where the governor had little power: The legislature met only every second year and other state officials, such as the lieutenant governor, enjoyed powers usually given to a governor. Bush revealed considerable tactical skills as governor. He demonstrated an ability to work with Democrats when necessary; for example, he persuaded Bob Bullock, a powerful Democrat in the Texas legislature, to cooperate with him so that he could achieve legislative successes in a legislature controlled by Democrats. He enacted legislation in his first term that stiffened testing standards in education, tried many juveniles in adult courts, and strengthened the work requirement for welfare recipients. Cautioned by his father not to run for the presidency until he had won a second term as governor, Bush won a landslide victory as governor in 1998. As he prepared for a White House run in 2000, he persuaded the Texas legislature to enact a large tax cut in his second term—just the kind of policy likely to coalesce conservatives around him in his run for the presidency. Bush was now positioned to become the Republican front-runner in the 2000 presidential race that would almost certainly pit him against Vice President Al Gore. He already appeared to be a Republican version of Bill Clinton. Just as Clinton appealed to Democratic liberals, Bush had strong support from Republican conservatives because of his Southern credentials, his strong support of tax cuts, and his Christian fundamentalism. If Clinton appealed to Democratic centrists, Bush had considerable support among Republican moderates and independents because of his brand of “compassionate conservatism” that included educational reforms. If Clinton filled a leadership vacuum in the Democratic Party in 1992 stemming from Democrats’ inability to win the presidency since the late 1970s, Bush came to the fore following the demise of Newt Gingrich, the far-right Republican who had been tactically bested by Clinton. Bush sensed that his timing was right. His promise to restore traditional values had great appeal in the wake of Clinton’s scandals. Because of his close association with Clinton, Gore too was harmed by these scandals. Gore also suffered from a widespread perception that he was excessively aloof. Bush was highly motivated. He wanted to avenge his father’s defeat by Clinton in 1992. He wanted to restore traditional and religious values to the United States, downsize the federal government, rebuild the military, and transfer many programs from the federal government to the states. He wanted to achieve the realignment that Reagan had begun by ushering in a Republican era that might last for decades. After decisively beating Senator John McCain in the Republican primaries, Bush faced off against Gore—who had easily defeated Senator Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries—and Green Party candidate Ralph Nader (see Insert 11.2 ). Insert 11.2. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: When Should W e Support Third- Party Candidates? Ralph Nader, a long-time consumer advocate, had impeccable reformist credentials when he accepted the presidential nomination of the Green Party in 2000 to run against the nominees of the Republican and Democratic Parties. He took positions to the left of both “establishment candidates,” championing living-wage legislation, cuts in military spending, efforts to end slave labor in developing nations, cuts in military spending, and expanded environmental programs. Liberals faced a dilemma, however. If they voted for Nader in states that were closely contested by Gore and Bush, they risked giving Bush a victory he would not otherwise have had. Indeed, we now know that Gore would almost certainly have been president if Nader had not run: Gore would have gotten Florida’s electoral votes had he received only a fraction of Nader’s 90,000 votes in Florida. Should liberals vote for a third-party candidate even if their votes might tip an election toward a conservative candidate? Do third-party candidates, even when they lose, change the policies and programs of establishment parties? In this case, did Nader’s presidential run in 2000 change policies of the Democratic Party? Did it matter that Bush became president rather than Gore—or was Nader correct in contending that Bush and Gore were indistinguishable? Review the Presidential Campaign of 2000 EP 1a EP 5c EP 8d Bush cemented support from conservatives by pledging a huge tax cut of $1.3 trillion spread over 10 years. Realizing that Democrats were vulnerable with respect to values, Bush portrayed himself as a family man who could unite the nation. When asked about his prior use of drugs and alcohol, he attributed them to “youthful indiscretion.” He appealed to moderates by arguing that he was a compassionate conservative who would support some increases in federal aid to education and a limited prescription drugs plan for Medicare recipients even as he promised to cut taxes substantially and to privatize Social Security by allowing workers to invest some of their payroll tax funds in the stock market. He appealed to Christian fundamentalists by supporting school prayer, promising government assistance to faith-based organizations that helped addicts, welfare mothers, and exprisoners, and opposing partial-birth abortions. He promised to initiate a voucher program for public schools that would allow some low-income students to transfer to church-related or other private schools. He pledged to commit a substantial portion of the multi-trillion- dollar surplus that was projected for the next decade to the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, as well as reducing the federal debt. * LO 11-2 Through most of the campaign, Gore presented positions that were only modestly different from Bush’s. * He supported greater increases in aid to education, a larger prescription drug program for Medicare recipients, and a much smaller tax cut of $250 billion. (He also favored Clinton’s plan to use projected surpluses to reduce the national debt and to infuse new resources into the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds.) Nor did the candidates differ much on foreign policy, with Bush promising to be less interventionist than Gore abroad and even promising smaller increases in military spending. Bush was far ahead in the polls during August, but the polls narrowed by mid-September. It became clear by early October that the election would be a cliffhanger that could be determined by three states: Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Gore was plagued by Nader, who campaigned as a militant progressive who wanted to cut military spending, establish national health insurance, and prioritize environmental reforms. Nader contended that little difference existed between Gore and Bush; he characterized both as captive to corporate and monied interests. * Since most of Nader’s voters would otherwise have voted for a Democrat, Nader threatened to give Bush a presidency he could not otherwise achieve if he took enough votes from Gore (see Insert 11.2 ). No one anticipated the election drama that followed the November election. The mass media initially called the election for Gore only to declare Bush as the next president later in the evening. The media then reversed itself by early morning as it became clear that Bush’s edge in Florida was so close that a recount was inevitable. A 7-week drama unfolded that involved courts, public opinion, and tactical moves by both candidates. Democrats demanded recounts in areas where black voters claimed harassment by election officials and where Jewish voters said they had mistakenly voted for both candidates, for Bush, or for the anti-Semitic Pat Buchanan, because of a confusing “butterfly” ballot. Democrats alleged that many votes had been improperly discarded by election officials due to “hanging chads” and “dimples” that resulted when voters failed to punch outdated manual ballots forcefully. * When Democrats demanded recounts primarily in Miami and Dade County, Republicans argued that existing results should be honored. When automatic recounts whittled Bush’s advantage to merely 327 votes in Florida, the Bush campaign tried to delay further vote recounts until mid- December, when each state was required to certify its electors to the electoral college. The Bush campaign intimidated local election officials by staging demonstrations against them with staff sent from Washington, DC. To convey yet further the legitimacy of his “victory,” Bush’s campaign asked Katherine Harris, Florida’s secretary of state, to “certify” Bush’s victory. Bush had a strategic advantage during this period of uncertainty. Because he had been the last of the two candidates to be called the victor, because some media outlets had already called him the 43rd American president, and because he had a razor-thin majority, he could more easily act as if he was the victor, even though Gore had won the nation’s popular vote by a significant margin. Bush had another advantage: His brother Jeb was Florida’s governor and controlled the state’s electoral apparatus and Republican legislature. Not only did Jeb get Florida’s secretary of state to certify his brother’s “victory,” but he frequently stated or implied that the legislature would select the electors if the voting process remained confused. (Each state had to choose its electors by mid-December.) With Rove at his side, Bush repeatedly outmaneuvered Gore. As the ordeal proceeded, Bush repeatedly claimed that he was the rightful victor, even appointing a transition team and beginning to name some cabinet officials —unlike Gore, who never contended he was the victor even though he led in the national popular vote. Both sides appealed to the courts to vindicate their positions. When a local judge decided that the recounts should be stopped, Democrats appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of votes in each of Florida’s counties—or a far larger area than the Democrats had requested. Bush, in turn, asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overrule Florida’s Supreme Court. When the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the Florida Supreme Court’s decision by a 5 to 4 vote, Gore’s only hope was further litigation in Florida. When he chose not to take further action, Bush became the next president. Two Americas The nation was narrowly divided. Gore received 48.4% of the popular vote against 47.9% for Bush. Most remaining votes went to Ralph Nader, including 90,000 votes in Florida that would have given Gore an easy victory had most of these voters cast their votes for Gore instead. Many congressional races were narrowly contested. When the tight elections of 1996, 1998, and 2000 are viewed in tandem, the United States had not had such a narrowly divided electorate since the 1880s. * Republicans and Democrats had markedly different constituencies. If 80% of the religious right voted for Bush, 61% of people with no religion voted for Gore. If Jews mostly voted for Gore, most white Protestants voted for Bush. (Catholics gave Bush a narrow margin.) If African Americans and Hispanics voted overwhelmingly for Gore, affluent white voters and blue- collar voters favored Bush. If most women voted for Gore, most men voted for Bush. If Republicans dominated rural areas across the nation, as well as recently established suburban areas, voters in the 23 largest metropolitan areas voted decisively for Gore. If Bush won most of the nonindustrial Midwestern and Western states, Gore won California, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Michigan. If upper-middle-class and upper- class Americans mostly voted Republican, persons earning less than $12,000 voted overwhelmingly for Gore. (A majority of blue-collar voters chose Bush. * ) These “two Americas” differed markedly in their values and policy preferences. If Bush’s followers tended to be religious, Gore’s followers were more secular. In contrast to Gore’s supporters, Bush’s followers tended to be pro-life, against gun control, and opposed to many environmental regulations. Bush’s rural and suburban voters often believed that liberal Democrats sought to impose big-city views on them. If Bush’s supporters favored diminishing the size of the federal government, Gore’s were more likely to view it favorably. * The narrow margins between the presidential candidates existed, as well, between congressional candidates. The Senate was evenly split between the two parties, though the vice president could cast a tiebreaking vote if necessary. Republicans had a margin of only five votes in the House of Representatives. So-called independent or swing voters occupied an uneasy niche between relatively conservative and liberal Americans. These voters, who would likely determine which candidate would be victorious in 2000, included “soccer moms”—suburban mothers who wanted expansion of social programs such as child care but favored fiscal conservatism. Political candidates of both parties conducted endless focus groups of these swing voters to gauge which issues were important to them since their votes could determine the outcome of the election in suburbs where a majority of American voters now resided. Bush’ s Domestic Policies Even though Bush had received fewer votes than Gore, he acted as if he had a mandate to cut taxes substantially not just to appease conservatives but to deplete resources that Democrats would otherwise use during the coming decade to propose domestic reforms. He delighted conservatives by taking a page out of Reagan’s book, now proposing a $1.7 trillion tax cut—or virtually all surplus funds that would be left over in the next 10 years once Congress had funded an array of farm subsidies, tax cuts, and other programs to which it was already committed—and he also used $2 trillion in surpluses to buttress the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. While Bush argued that the tax cut would stimulate a lagging economy, many economists countered that it would have little stimulatory effect because most of its benefits went to affluent Americans who, unlike poorer Americans, would not immediately spend their new resources on consumer goods. Almost 40% of the tax cut’s benefits went to the wealthiest 1%. Conservatives were delighted by Bush’s tax cut. It rewarded Republicans’ corporate and affluent campaign contributors by slashing corporate income taxes and the taxes of affluent Americans—and pleased conservatives who wanted to downsize the federal government. Bush’s tax cut was enacted, but Democrats and Republicans were able to decrease it to $1.35 trillion. Bush invested far more political resources in his tax cut than he did in other domestic measures in the first 3 years of his presidency; indeed, David Frum, Bush’s former speechwriter and strong supporter, viewed the tax cut as Bush’s greatest—and last—domestic achievement. * Many Democrats argued in vain against the tax cut. It would, they feared, plunge the United States back into deficits if economists’ 10-year projections about economic growth (and therefore tax revenues) were excessively optimistic. It would increase economic inequality yet further, exacerbating a trend that had begun in the 1970s. No new federal resources would be available for schools, social services, prescription drug benefits under Medicare, or programs to give health insurance to the uninsured. To their chagrin, sufficient numbers of moderate and conservative Democrats supported the tax cut, and allowed it to be enacted. * Determined not to let Democrats take the initiative, Bush also initiated education, faith-based, and prescription drug proposals, as well as proposals to privatize Social Security and to the budget for the coming year that sought deep cuts in many programs used by low-income Americans. Bush’s ability to secure enactment of his domestic agenda was severely harmed, however, when Senator Jim Jeffords (D., NH) announced in May 2001 that he was leaving the Republican Party to become an independent. Senator Jeffords, a moderate Republican, had mostly voted with Democrats on domestic issues, so his defection not only gave the Democrats a one- person majority in the Senate, but a valuable ally. His defection was even more ominous for Bush because other moderate Republican senators, such as Lincoln Chafee (R., R.I.) and Olympia Snow (R., Me.) might do the same. These senators wanted greater funding of education and environmental reforms—and were less favorable than other Republicans to privatization of Social Security. When teamed with Democrats, they could block Bush’s initiatives—or demand substantial changes in them. Democrats now had greater control of the Senate’s agenda because, as the majority party in the Senate, they took over the chairing of the Senate’s committees. The federal government had given resources to public schools with high concentrations of low-income students since 1965, but critics contended that students’ educational performance had not significantly improved. Why not, Bush asked, develop federal tests for students in these public schools so that students in schools that did not improve their scores could be given vouchers to attend other schools of their choosing, including parochial or other religious-based schools? Critics from the liberal and moderate wings of both parties criticized his proposal. How can education improve, they asked, if the federal government doesn’t increase its spending on education to reduce student-to-teacher ratios (many inner-city schools had classes with as many as 40 students in them) or repair dilapidated schools? Would the use of standardized tests to measure the performance of schools merely lead teachers to “teach to the tests” rather than striving to enhance critical thinking? Without funds to educate new teachers and incentives to entice them to teach in middle-income schools, wouldn’t inner-city schools suffer from lower-quality teachers compared with suburban areas? Didn’t schools need funds for social and public health programs to help truants and troubled children and to avert sexually transmitted diseases? After substantial pressure from Republican moderates, Bush, to his credit, increased the funds devoted to education by several billion dollars. * Many persons criticized Bush’s school voucher proposal. Would vouchers that paid parents only $1,500 be sufficient to entice private schools to accept low-income students—and would these funds merely reduce monies available for public schools by taking money away from their budgets? Would affluent parents who were already sending their children to private schools get a rebate on their private school tuition by using publicly funded vouchers themselves? Many critics feared that vouchers violated the Constitution’s separation of church and state, since they would provide public funds to religious schools. In parochial schools, the largest system of church-sponsored schools in the United States, all students are required to attend religious instruction and to view religious symbols (such as crucifixes) that are prominently displayed. Critics wondered, as well, if private schools could be held accountable to the same standards that Bush proposed for public schools: Would they agree to test their students using the same instruments as public schools? * Critics had similar fears about Bush’s proposal to fund social services offered by churches and religious organizations, which he called “faith- based programs.” The federal government, as well as state and local governments, had long funded social services sponsored by religious organizations provided they created separate and secular not-for-profit organizations that stripped religious content and symbols from their services and facilities. Indeed, Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist, and Jewish charitable organizations had provided outstanding services to citizens for decades that were heavily subsidized by public authorities. Even with these stipulations, however, some critics wondered if sufficient data were available to determine whether Catholic Charities—the largest private provider of social welfare services in the United States—had truly insulated its agencies from Catholic doctrine, such as with respect to clients who want abortions—a procedure that is forbidden by the Catholic faith—or homosexuals, whose preferences and lifestyles are opposed by Catholic doctrine. * Bush proposed, by contrast, that public funds could go to religious organizations even if they did not attempt to create social welfare agencies that were distinct from themselves. * Critics wondered what standards would be used to assess the effectiveness of publicly funded faith-based programs. Might not religious organizations use some of their funds to pay a portion of the clergies’ salaries? Would some use funds for faith healing even when persons needed traditional medical services? Would public funds be commingled with other church revenues, making it difficult to discern whether they were used for social services or for religious purposes? Could faith-based programs compromise clients’ self-determination if clients were proselytized in the course of treatment, particularly if other secular services did not exist in the area or had long waiting lists? Would untrained persons in church-based charities harm some persons with serious mental and health conditions because they lacked sufficient knowledge about treating them? Do direct public subsidies of churches violate the separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution? Should the federal government support organizations with hiring practices that discriminate against people on the basis of their religion or, in the case of agnostics and atheists, their nonreligion? * Critics also feared that Bush wished to use grants to faith-based groups to cement and increase support for Republicans among fundamentalist religious groups. Bush found none of these criticisms to be convincing. Don’t many persons with social problems benefit, he asked, from spiritual guidance and, in some cases, conversion? (His own recovery from alcoholism had been linked to his conversion to Christian fundamentalism.) Don’t religious beliefs provide persons with the strength to surmount problems like substance abuse, mental illness, and marital conflict? Don’t church-sponsored charities need public resources to allow them to reach many needy persons? Bush created a White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives in 2001—and supported legislation in the House of Representatives to allow federal funding of these programs. With opponents threatening lawsuits to test the constitutionality of faith-based programs and with even some fundamentalist Christians opposing them, the legislation stalled in Congress and was never enacted during his presidency. Undeterred, Bush made grants to faith-based groups subsequently in his administration by using the executive power of the presidency. Without taking a position on the constitutionality of faith-based grants, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a lawsuit by a Wisconsin-based group against the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives reversing a decision in favor of the plaintiffs by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Leaders of both political parties realized that their political fortunes depended on support from senior citizens—a rapidly growing group as baby boomers (persons born between 1946 and 1964) neared retirement. Many seniors were angry that Medicare failed to fund enrollees’ prescription drugs even though many seniors required expensive drugs to maintain their health. This omission became even more harmful to seniors in ensuing decades due to the development of numerous effective—and expensive— medications for chronic diseases that often cost seniors more than $2,500 annually. (Those seniors who relied on Social Security checks for survival, most of whom received less than $12,000 annually, could not afford supplemental private insurance to cover some of their drug expenses.) Proposals advanced by Republicans and Democrats differed significantly. Democrats wanted Medicare to administer the prescription drug benefit because they believed volume purchases and price regulation would cut the cost of the medications. Republicans wanted to rely on market competition by letting private companies administer the drug benefit because they believed market competition between competing plans would drive prices downward. Democrats wanted to cover a larger portion of the cost of medications, amounting to $800 billion or more over 10 years, but Republicans proposed lower coverage costing $400 billion. Locked in ideological conflict and with different versions, no version made it through the deadlocked Congress in 2001 or 2002. * The two parties also locked horns over Social Security. Many Republicans favored a partial privatizing of Social Security that would allow workers to start “individual investment accounts” (IAAs) with a portion of their payroll taxes. These workers would invest their funds in the stock market rather than contributing them to Social Security’s Trust Fund. The conservatives’ logic seemed compelling because the stock market had historically yielded higher returns than government bonds, where surplus funds in the Trust Fund have been invested. It appealed, as well, to Americans’ individualism by allowing persons to maintain personal accounts rather than commingling all of their payroll taxes in the Trust Fund for the benefit of current retirees. * Many Democrats feared, however, that some workers’ investments could turn sour. Did not stocks often decline during economic downturns, such as during the huge stock market decline during the first 2 years of the Bush administration? Would some workers select risky investments and later require welfare payments to survive during their retirement years? Would the Republicans’ proposal enrich Wall Street firms who would handle workers’ investments? Would privatization further imperil the long-term solvency of the Trust Fund by diverting some payroll taxes from it to IAAs, particularly since the monies to fund them would have to come from the Trust Fund since Bush had proposed few additional sources of public funding? In the case of vouchers for public schools, privatization of Social Security, and use of private insurance companies to administer Medicare’s drug benefit, the Bush administration possessed a kind of private market fundamentalism. * It assumed that private markets work more efficiently than government programs and give consumers more choices. Critics of this view charged that Bush did not realize that private markets are often inefficient, as is illustrated by companies that go bankrupt, excessive salaries paid to top executives, resources wasted on marketing and advertising, and even fraud as was illustrated in the case of corporate scandals during the Bush administration. Government programs have their problems, these critics admitted, but why view private markets as a panacea? The two parties also differed with regard to the future of welfare reform. Clinton had initiated welfare reform when he signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act in 1996, which provided welfare grants known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The legislation required that welfare reform be reauthorized in 2002 when Congress would decide whether to change it or keep it relatively intact. While states were given the power to shape their welfare programs, they were also bound by numerous federal regulations, such as 5-year limits for most welfare recipients and penalties if they failed to reduce welfare rolls. If the success of welfare reform is measured by the reduction in rolls, it was a resounding triumph. To everyone’s surprise, in the wake of welfare reform, there was runaway economic growth as well as unanticipated growth in relatively unskilled jobs in clerical, sales, health care, and other areas. When coupled with a shift in the culture of local welfare offices that emphasized work, this economic growth led to a roughly 50% reduction in welfare rolls by 2002. Critics conceded that many women benefited from working rather than remaining on welfare—and that some women found jobs that paid wages sufficient to elevate them above poverty levels. * Yet welfare reform also led to problems. Most women who left welfare became mired in low-wage jobs with few or no fringe benefits such as health insurance. These women remained impoverished. Because welfare reform ceded many policy decisions to the states, moreover, former recipients fared poorly in states with relatively punitive policies. In contrast to more generous states, some had their child care and Medicaid benefits terminated soon after they left the rolls, leaving them sometimes poorer than when they had received welfare. Focusing on reducing the rolls, many welfare offices provided recipients with scant assistance in upgrading their employment after they received their initial jobs. Welfare workers often viewed themselves exclusively as enforcers of work not only for existing recipients but for persons applying for welfare. They were not encouraged by supervisors to give recipients assistance in finding training programs, attending college, upgrading their work from dead-end to higher-level jobs, or finding a career. * Many recipients discovered that states did not count study in community colleges as “work,” so they could not upgrade their skills while receiving welfare. Not surprisingly, then, many recipients got dead-end jobs initially—and did not advance beyond them as time went on. When welfare reform was enacted, few persons asked how recipients’ children would fare as their mothers entered the workforce. A mixed picture emerged. Some research suggests that children of working mothers are not harmed. Other researchers find evidence that children who are placed in day care from an early age are more aggressive than other children—and a small but significant number become very aggressive. Still other experts believe that the quality of children’s child care is pivotal: If children are put in centers, for example, with a high ratio of children to staff, they are more likely to be harmed than children in quality programs. * Critics of welfare reform cite, as well, the paucity of social services for those recipients who remained on the rolls. Many long-term users of welfare suffer from clinical depression, and many are alcoholic or chronic users of drugs. Yet few states funded sufficient services for recipients to enable them to enter the economic mainstream. * Different approaches emerged for reforming TANF when it was scheduled to be reauthorized in 2002. If conservatives wanted to cut back federal funding for social services and exempt even fewer women from the 5-year limits, liberals wanted to maintain or increase the federal funding while exempting more women from these limits. Some liberals also wanted to provide resources to allow states to place more emphasis on upgrading recipients’ job skills or in helping them obtain high school diplomas or college degrees. The National Association of Social Workers wanted to upgrade and stabilize the workforce employed by welfare agencies since few line or supervising workers even possessed bachelor’s degrees in the social sciences, much less in social work. Nor did they often possess skills to work with former recipients as they coped with low wages and child care issues, as well as help them gain access to safety net programs such as Medicaid and Food Stamps. (Many former recipients failed to receive benefits from these programs even when they were eligible for them.) Due to partisan bickering, reauthorization of TANF by Congress did not occur until spring, when relatively few changes were made in the legislation. Discuss September 1 1, 2001 George W. Bush’s popularity sagged in the polls by midsummer 2001—and it appeared that he, like his father, would be a one-term president. Democrats had realistic prospects of increasing their one-vote majority in the Senate and possibly regaining control of the House in congressional elections in November 2002 as voters became more concerned about the declining economy. Everything changed when two hijacked commercial jet planes slammed into and toppled the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City on the morning of September 11, 2001 (see Figure 11.1 ); another crashed into the Pentagon; a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers thwarted hijackers who wanted to hit either the White House or the Capitol Building. The nation was stunned by the magnitude of casualties as well as the graphic images of the disaster portrayed on the mass media. LO 11-3 Figure 11.1. Robert Giroux/Getty Images The World Trade Center under terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The nation learned within days that the culprit was a terrorist organization based in Afghanistan, known as Al-Qaeda, that was led by Osama bin Laden. American intelligence services had known about Al-Qaeda for years. They knew it had orchestrated a prior bombing of the Twin Towers, an American destroyer at anchor in the Middle East, and American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Indeed, a diligent agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation who ironically was killed in the Twin Towers on September 11 had predicted an Al-Qaeda assault on the Twin Towers but had not been able to get the attention of higher American officials. * Bin Laden glorified ancient Muslim religious traditions and the theocracy that existed during and after the life of Mohammed in the 6th and 7th centuries AD, where church leaders dictated the policies and moral rules of a paternalistic society. He believed that the spread of Western capitalism, secular culture, sexual mores, and feminism into the Middle East had undermined these traditional values and theocracies and led to the rise of leaders who were controlled by Western nations, were not observant Muslims, and who tolerated the infusion of Western customs into their nations. He was particularly angered by the ongoing presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia after America’s war with Iraq in 1991. Convinced that diplomatic and peaceful remedies were not possible, bin Laden plotted guerilla warfare against Arab leaders and industrialized nations. * Evicted from several Middle Eastern nations because he plotted against their leaders, bin Laden withdrew to Afghanistan, where a dictatorial Muslim theocracy known as the Taliban gave him sanctuary. From this remote bastion, bin Laden recruited and trained a large force of terrorists who were schooled in bombing, assassinations, and attacks on infrastructure. bin Laden developed an unknown number of “sleeper cells” in Western nations composed of terrorists who would follow his instructions. One group of Al-Qaeda terrorists moved to Germany, where they enrolled in technical programs. Some of them relocated to the United States in about 2000. Led by those who received pilot training in American schools, these terrorists orchestrated the terrorist attacks of September 11. * Bush declared a war on global terrorism in the immediate aftermath of September 11. He said that this war would be the focus of his administration. He persuaded Congress to enact a war resolution that gave him the authority to use military force not only to defeat the Taliban, but to attack terrorist forces anywhere in the world as well as nations that harbored them. He issued an ultimatum to the Taliban to turn over bin Laden or face invasion. He assembled a broad coalition of nations to participate in possible military action at a time when world opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the United States. When they refused, he ordered a massive bombing campaign in Afghanistan that was quickly followed by the introduction of ground troops. In liaison with forces of some other nations, the United States quickly defeated the Taliban and installed a new regime, but the elusive bin Laden escaped—possibly due to miscues by American military leaders who failed to seal the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Gridlock With bin Laden on the run, it seemed in the late spring of 2002 that the nation was returning to normalcy, although many citizens feared a renewal of terrorism on the home front. Their fears were intensified when an unknown person or group sent anthrax-dusted letters to several political leaders—causing the temporary shutdown of a Senate office building, the closure of some post office facilities, and several deaths. Many persons wondered if terrorists would use biological, chemical, and radiological weapons of mass destruction in coming years by gaining entry through poorly guarded ports and borders. The nation took many domestic measures to diminish the risk of further terrorist attacks. Security precautions were increased at the nation’s airports. Congress enacted the USA Patriot Act in October 2001, which gave law enforcement agencies expanded powers of surveillance over communications within and outside the United States, gave the government significant power to fight the financing of terror through money-laundering operations, and gave the attorney general broad power to detain individuals suspected of terrorist connections. While Bush urged citizens not to discriminate against Muslims in the United States and said that hate crimes would not be tolerated, many persons feared that the Justice Department deprived many Muslims of their rights by incarcerating them without formal charges and denying them access to legal counsel. When they learned that many persons of Middle Eastern descent were placed in prisons or other facilities for extended periods, with no charges levied against them and without even being allowed to consult an attorney, critics of the Patriot Act contended that it gave the government excessive authority. Immigration procedures were tightened, particularly against persons of Middle Eastern backgrounds. Realizing that the nation needed to coordinate the work of the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and other programs to provide an effective defense against domestic terrorism, Democrats proposed the creation of a Homeland Security Agency, only to meet concerted opposition from Republicans, who called the proposal a liberal, big-government scheme. Bush’s education proposal, called No Child Left Behind, was finally enacted in January 2002 when Senator Ted Kennedy, deciding that half a loaf was better than none, rallied many Democrats to support the legislation. The revised bill increased federal subsidies to schools by about $11 billion but did not establish vouchers. It required states to develop or use existing standardized tests to measure the proficiency of students in reading and math—and then to monitor schools to see if their students’ scores improved. If they did not improve, states had to put the schools on notice; schools would eventually be closed if test scores continued to show no improvement. Critics feared that the legislation would lead teachers to “teach to tests” rather than enhancing students’ critical thinking skills and that failing schools would not receive sufficient technical and financial assistance to improve their programs. They noted, as well, that charter schools (private schools established with significant assistance from local public school districts under legislation enacted during the Clinton administration) were not covered by the No Child Left Behind legislation and often were not monitored by local or state public school authorities, giving them leeway not given to public schools. (Congressional supporters of education were disappointed to learn in the 2003 and 2004 budgets that Bush had requested many billions of dollars less than had been authorized by Congress in 2002.) Faith-based, prescription drug, and Social Security legislation stalled in Congress. The economy continued to deteriorate in 2002; it became clear that the nation was mired in an economic downturn in the aftermath of the “dot com bubble” of the middle and late 1990s—a bubble partly created by investment bankers who gave inflated accounts of the prospects of firms from which they received business in order to boost their stock prices artificially. Trillions of dollars of assets were lost as the stock market collapsed. For the first time since the Great Depression, some economists feared the specter of deflation as corporations cut prices of their products to sell them in the face of declining demand. The stock market’s collapse and the declining economic activity posed a growing fiscal challenge to many states, who found their revenues rapidly declining. If state governments had primarily focused on education, law enforcement, prisons, mental hospitals, and highways in the 1970s, they now carried a much larger burden in the wake of the devolution of many federal programs to them, such as the block grants established by the Reagan administration. Confronted with declining revenues as well as mounting counterterrorism expenses, many states slashed spending on social and educational programs. * (Unlike the federal government, which can issue treasury bonds to fund operating deficits, most state governments are required to run balanced budgets and solve budget shortfalls by cutting spending or raising taxes.) The pleas of some liberals to revive revenue sharing, where the federal government contributes some of its tax revenues to states—a policy that had been terminated by President Reagan—found little support from the Bush administration. President Bush was embarrassed, as well, by corporate scandals. Corporations such as Enron, WorldCom, and Global Crossing had used fraudulent accounting to overstate their profits in a bid to keep their stock prices high in the late 1990s. When the companies entered bankruptcy proceedings, the extent of the fraud became clear. As Bush staunched criticism by changing the SEC’s leadership and approving accounting reforms, many people wondered if the corporate scandals of 2001 and 2002 were merely the tip of the iceberg. They also wondered if legislation enacted by Congress, which placed more responsibility on corporate directors and established stiff penalties for accounting irregularities, would bring genuine reforms. (In just a few years, speculative practices of American banks would cause the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.) A positive outcome of the corporate scandals was the enactment of campaign finance legislation. Both parties had received tens of millions of dollars of corporate contributions, as well as contributions from affluent individuals. While some of these funds went directly to candidates where prior legislation had established some upper limits, unregulated “soft money” went to the political parties themselves. In so-called issue ads, such as ones that opposed gun control, the parties could indirectly promote Republican or Democratic candidates without mentioning their names. Democrats received much of their funds from unions, and Republicans got vast amounts of corporate support. With both parties fearing that campaign finance reforms would curtail their resources, legislation went nowhere for years. With the sponsorship of Senators Russ Feingold (D., Wisc.) and John McCain (R., Ariz.), the campaign finance reforms finally got traction when Republicans, in the wake of the corporate scandals, realized they could not put it off any longer. * It remained to be seen if the reforms would make lasting changes. The reforms outlawed soft money but doubled the limit on contributions from individuals to candidates, capping them at $2,000. Both parties, but particularly the Republicans, solicited a growing army of affluent supporters to give their parties the upper limit. By mid-2003, Bush operatives boasted that they would raise $100 million by 2004—doubling the record amount Bush had raised in 2000. While experts debated the precise effects of campaign contributions on politicians, there can be no doubt that money gave access to powerful interests as compared with advocacy groups representing poor people. Bush Shifts the Agenda Abroad In the middle of 2002, as in the summer of 2001, the Democrats’ political fortunes seemed bright. With Bush’s popularity declining amid a struggling economy and congressional gridlock—and with fears about terrorism abating after the defeat of the Taliban—they hoped they would increase their majority in the Senate and acquire a majority in the House in the congressional elections of 2002. (The parties of the incumbent president usually lose seats in midterm elections.) If the events of September 11 had shattered Democrats’ hopes in 2001, President Bush was their nemesis in 2002, when he abruptly shifted the agenda from domestic matters to terrorism and war. Suddenly, Bush proposed war with Iraq unless that nation immediately disclosed the whereabouts of biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons of mass destruction that UN inspectors had discovered in the 1990s before being evicted from the country. (Inspectors had been allowed to enter Iraq as part of the surrender terms imposed on Iraq the United Nations (UN) this took place at the end of the war with coalition forces led by the United States in the early 1990s.) No apparent information or events caused Bush to focus on Iraq in August of 2002. Iraq had used weapons of mass destruction in the past, both against Iranians in the 1980s and against the Kurdish Iraqis in the wake of George H. W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq after it had invaded Kuwait—a brief war called Desert Storm. UN inspectors had discovered some weapons of mass destruction—as well as plants to make them—in the 1990s, but most experts believed they had been successful in finding them even though Saddam Hussein ousted them from his nation in the late 1990s. Iraq remained a weakened nation due to severe trade sanctions imposed the United Nations (UN) after Desert Storm—sanctions so severe that many children starved because Iraq lacked sufficient food. The United States and Britain were allowed by the UN to conduct aerial surveillance of considerable portions of Iraq’s territory so it could not resume the killing of Kurds and other tribal groups. Iraq could not export oil, its major asset, except to secure funds for food, drugs, and other survival needs. Iraq’s economy was considerably smaller than Idaho’s in 2000. Nor had any evidence surfaced that Hussein was linked to Al-Qaeda or had any role in the terrorist events of September 11. (Indeed, bin Laden had disliked Hussein and urged his overthrow; he viewed Hussein as a secular rather than a Muslim leader.) In short, Iraq did not appear to be an imminent threat to the United States in August of 2002. Two journalists, who wrote a definitive account of the relationship between Karl Rove and Bush, conjecture that Bush brought up Iraq for political reasons. * With the congressional elections of 2002 looming and Republicans’ prospects declining, Bush wanted to rally the nation around himself and his party by creating a threat to the United States even when none existed. Bush also wanted to punish Saddam Hussein for hiring thugs to assassinate his father in the early 1990s (they did not succeed). He wanted to finish the job his father had started in Desert Storm: not just keep Hussein from invading other nations, but remove him from office. Whatever his reasons, Bush now heeded those advisors who had wanted the United States to invade Iraq long before Bush was elected president, including then Chairman of the Defense Policy Board Richard Perle, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and Vice President Dick Cheney. These men had urged Bill Clinton to launch an invasion on the grounds that Hussein represented an imminent threat to the United States. They had urged Bush to invade Iraq immediately after September 11, even though no links between Hussein and Al-Qaeda had been established. * They pressured Bush to invade Iraq after the defeat of the Taliban. Not only did Bush issue an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein, but he shifted American foreign policy to allow “preemptive strikes” when the United States suspected another nation was funding or preparing terrorist strikes against it or was preparing terrorists or giving them weapons of mass destruction. He argued that the United States could suffer catastrophic damage if it waited until terrorist acts had actually occurred. The new policy, issued by the White House in September 2002, said: While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists. Critics wondered if the doctrine of preemptive strikes, which had never been propounded by an American president, might threaten the international order. Might not other nations, too, contend they could also initiate action against any nation they suspected might harm them rather than waiting for the other nation to take aggressive action, as had been the custom in the past? Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, feared even after the Iraq War was over that the concept of preemptive strikes would threaten international order. Other critics feared that the U.S. policy would encourage some smaller nations, such as North Korea, to develop weapons of mass destruction to forestall American attacks. Secretary of State Colin Powell convinced Bush not to act precipitously or unilaterally for fear that other nations, and particularly Middle Eastern nations, would view the United States as the aggressor. Reluctantly agreeing with Powell, Bush persuaded the Security Council to issue an ultimatum to Hussein: Allow UN inspectors to renew their inspections, disclose to the UN what had happened to weapons of mass destruction that Iraq had possessed, and show the inspectors any current weapons or plants to manufacture them. Hussein readmitted the inspectors, who could locate no weapons of mass destruction in months of exhaustive searches of Iraq. But Hussein was vague with respect to whether and how he had destroyed weapons of mass destruction that the UN had located in the 1990s. Even before Bush changed his foreign policy, he had swung from opposition to support of the establishment of a Homeland Security Agency when he issued his version of it in June 2002. He insisted, however, that its workforce not be allowed to unionize—a policy that led many Democrats to oppose its establishment until this proviso was removed from the legislation. Bush had decisively shifted the agenda from the economy and domestic issues to Iraq. He barnstormed the United States in the months preceding the November election, pledging to remove Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction if Hussein did not remove them. He implied that Democrats were soft on terrorism because they held up the enactment of the Homeland Security Agency. Bush’s and Republicans’ ratings in the polls moved upward, especially among women, some elderly persons, and some blue- collar persons—the swing voters that could tip the balance between the two parties. Bush’s shift in the national agenda from domestic issues and the economy to Iraq and the establishment of the Homeland Security Agency paid huge political dividends in the 2002 congressional elections. If Democrats had even hoped to control both houses of Congress, Republicans took back control of the Senate and widened their majority in the House. Bush was in a commanding position to launch his bid for reelection in 2004. Evaluate the W ar with Iraq Even though UN inspectors could not find weapons of mass destruction, Bush insisted that Hussein’s refusal to make a full accounting of his weapons meant that he possessed them. He alleged in his State of the Union address in January 2003 that British intelligence had discovered that Iraq had sought to obtain uranium from Niger, an African nation. Both he and Powell contended links existed between Hussein and Al-Qaeda, but neither of them produced definitive proof. Deciding to bypass the UN’s Security Council after the French, Germans, and Russians refused to support a UN resolution to sanction an American- led invasion, Bush took matters into his own hands by issuing an ultimatum to Hussein to give a full accounting of biological, radiological, and chemical materials or face an invasion. Criticism of Bush’s decisions escalated not only in the United States, but around the world. Large anti-war demonstrations took place at home and abroad. Critics contended that the Bush administration had not revealed convincing evidence that Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. Why not, they asked, give the UN inspectors more time to find the weapons of mass destruction? Wouldn’t a war with Iraq drain resources from America’s domestic programs? Could it enmesh the United States in a lengthy and dangerous occupation of Iraq? Was it wise for the United States to proceed unilaterally (only Britain among large industrial nations agreed to cooperate with the United States) rather than, as in Desert Storm, with an international coalition? Pivotal testimony by Colin Powell before the United Nations alleged that an African nation was exporting to Iraq materials needed to process uranium. It was revealed in subsequent years that this intelligence was false and that the administration had ignored warnings about the unreliable source of this LO 11-4 information. Moreover, it was also revealed in 2007 that top intelligence officers had warned the United States that an American invasion of Iraq could assist Al-Qaeda in recruiting thousands of additional terrorists because American occupation of any Arab nation could be portrayed by them as offensive to Arab culture and imperialistic. Yet other intelligence experts warned the administration that the toppling of Hussein could instigate a civil war in Iraq between Sunni, Shiite, and Kurdish tribal factions. Were these warnings to come true—and many critics of the invasion believed by 2007 that they had come to pass—the American invasion might worsen the situation in Iraq and the Middle East as well as cause large numbers of deaths of American troops and Iraqi citizens. The United States commenced a bombing campaign against Iraq in the spring of 2003 that was soon followed by a full-scale invasion. To their surprise, the Americans met little resistance as they moved across Iraq toward Baghdad—nor were weapons of mass destruction used against them or discovered. Bush declared a victory (in front of a banner that read “Mission Accomplished”) on May 1, 2003, on a navy carrier off the coast of Southern California. The occupation of Iraq proved far more difficult than the Pentagon had foreseen. (The United States insisted that it take the primary role in reconstructing Iraq rather than ceding this function to the UN.) Looters pillaged power stations, water stations, government facilities, hospitals, museums, schools, and universities. People settled old scores by killing unknown numbers of Iraqis. People and groups disliking the American occupation launched guerilla warfare that took a weekly toll on American forces in the summer of 2003, leading some critics to wonder if the United States was headed toward a Vietnam-style quagmire. Different factions within Iraq quarreled with one another as the United States found it difficult to establish a new regime. Iraq had been ruled by dictatorial and monarchical forms of government for centuries, and it remained to be seen if democratic regimes could emerge or if American troops and those of other nations would have to continue the occupation for an extended period. The nation required huge expenditures on infrastructure and social programs; some experts believed the United States would have to keep about 150,000 troops in Iraq indefinitely at a cost of roughly $4 billion per month. It was unclear in the spring of 2004 when and how the United States would establish a new Iraqi government. Critics contended that U.S. officials had greatly underestimated the unrest that would occur in Iraq, as well as the number of troops needed to maintain order. Angry that the United States had proceeded without UN concurrence, most European nations refused to participate in the reconstruction of Iraq unless the UN was given a leading role (only Great Britain contributed substantial troops), even though Bush frequently boasted that the United States had enlisted a broad coalition of nations to occupy Iraq. (Most British troops had been withdrawn from Iraq by 2008.) American Social W elfare Policy Abroad The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq raise broader issues about America’s role in developing nations. Can a wealthy nation, with a reluctant welfare state at home, respond constructively to poverty and disease outside of its borders? Critics wondered if the United States would commit itself to the long-term reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq in the wake of hostilities. They charged that the United States as well as other industrialized nations had reneged on resources that they had pledged for Afghanistan’s reconstruction. Would it commit the forces and resources to these nations for years to come? Or would the United States quickly abandon these nations—or merely install puppet regimes? Critics also wondered if the United States would address some of the basic discontent in the Arab world that allowed bin Laden and other terrorist leaders to recruit large numbers of young Muslims to their organizations in the first place, such as poverty and the widespread belief in Muslim nations that the United States favored Israel over Palestine. Nor had the United States been generous to developing nations, allocating far less of its federal budget to foreign aid than many other industrialized nations. (The United States gave only 0.10% of its GDP to developing nations, while Denmark gave 1.06%, Britain gave 0.32%, and Japan gives 0.28%.) * World poverty is staggering in its dimensions: If 1.2 billion people (or 23% of the global population) around the world live on less than a dollar a day, 2.8 billion survive on less than $2 a day. * In the absence of strong public health institutions, diseases like malaria, typhoid fever, and AIDS devastated the health of citizens in developing nations. Nor could these nations afford expensive medications and diagnostic equipment widely used in industrial nations (see Insert 11.3 ). Insert 1 1.3. Ethical Analysis of Key Issues and Policies: Should W e Be Concerned about Low Levels of American Foreign Aid? International issues are not typically placed under the rubric of social welfare policy in the United States. To what extent do affluent industrial nations like the United States have an ethical obligation to provide resources to address poverty and disease in developing nations? What first-order ethical principles are at stake? What consequences could the United States encounter if it (and other industrialized nations) gave virtually no resources to developing nations? The UN established goals in its Millennium Declaration of 2000 to halve poverty and hunger rates by 2015 and to reduce child mortality by two- thirds. Data indicate, however, that 54 nations have become poorer since 1990, hunger has increased in 21 nations, and child mortality has risen in 14 nations. Furthermore, the UN’s Human Development Index, which includes economic, health, and education measures, fell in 21 nations during the 1990s as compared with only four nations during the 1980s. * To Bush’s credit, he became the first president to commit major resources ($10 billion initially in new funds followed by promises of $30 billion in 2007) toward combating the AIDS epidemic in Africa, where as many as 40% of citizens in some nations were HIV-positive or had AIDS. Even greater resources were needed, however, not just in Africa, but in India, China, Russia, Eastern Europe, and other Asian nations where this disease was rapidly spreading. Even in 2007, more than one case of AIDS emerged for every new case that was treated in the world. Nor had the United States always been sensitive to the needs of developing nations in trade negotiations under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Many Americans had naively assumed that movement toward free trade would help all nations to improve their economic condition. While free trade often did increase the flow of goods between nations, it also had some negative repercussions. * Developing nations possessed less efficient businesses and agriculture than industrialized nations, such as small farms that lacked modern machinery, preventing them from competing with businesses and agribusinesses in industrialized nations. Peasant producers of corn in Mexico, for example, could not compete with corn from huge American agribusinesses, forcing them to leave their farms for urban areas in Mexico or to cross into the United States. For many of these farmers, the opening of their markets to American producers would mean financial disaster. Nor did the United States always play by the rules. After insisting on free trade in agriculture with many nations, for example, Congress enacted $400 billion of federal agricultural subsidies in 2002 that gave American agribusiness an unfair advantage over farmers in developing nations. Not receiving these subsidies, it was impossible for them to compete with American produce that was heavily subsidized by the American government. The United States and other industrialized nations often retained trade barriers against developing nations, such as against their food products and apparel. A major transformation of the world’s economy, called globalization, accelerated in the 1990s and into the first decade of the 21st century. Defined as the free movement of capital and labor across national boundaries, globalization had both positive and negative consequences. As American corporations relocated plants in developing nations to take advantage of lower wages and fewer government regulations, they provided employment to citizens in these nations and brought low-priced goods to American consumers. The corporations often paid inadequate wages, however, and created unsafe working conditions as well as environmental hazards. American trade unionists argued, moreover, that corporations eliminated many domestic factories to reap profits from lower wages in developing nations. Globalization also placed pressure, some persons believed, on industrialized nations to reduce the size of their welfare states, since they sometimes lowered their taxes to stop corporations from relocating in developing nations that imposed few taxes on them and their personnel. * The American-controlled World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which gave loans to developing nations, funded many good projects but often imposed requirements on developing nations that exacerbated their social and economic problems. They often required draconian cuts in their budgets to curtail their deficits—cuts that often hurt their ability to provide needed social, health, and educational services. Sometimes, too, they urged nations to proceed directly to capitalism rather than viewing the process of transition as more gradual in nature. * A robust international protest movement had developed by 2000 that targeted the economic policies of industrialized nations, as well as policies of the World Bank and the IMF. Protesters demanded the inclusion of wage and working condition stipulations in free trade agreements, as well as radical changes in policies of the World Bank and the IMF. They also demanded that industrialized nations forgive some of the debt that developing nations had incurred from loans they had received from their governments and banks. They insisted that developing nations not be told they had to cut domestic spending severely as a condition of getting loans and grants. Developing nations need huge investments in their educational, infrastructure, health, and agricultural systems if they are to increase their economic growth by using the sophisticated technologies that industrialized nations possess. (Industrialized nations reached their current economic condition only because their governments invested heavily in these areas during the last century.) Since developing nations lack resources to fund these investments—and many of them were burdened with huge interest payments on their national debt—the funds must mostly come from industrialized nations. While Bush deserves credit for promising to raise American foreign aid from 0.10% of GDP to 0.15% by 2006, many other European nations have pledged to expand their foreign aid far more rapidly from a base much higher than that of the United States. * Figure 1 1.2. PAUL J. RICHARDS/Getty Images Protestors against the World Bank and IMF in 2004. Environmental issues had become increasingly important as degradation of the oceans, atmosphere, and rivers became increasingly evident. Initially dismissed by many people as conjectural, evidence mounted that the world was warming in a trend that could jeopardize the climates of many areas. A section of the Antarctic Ice Cap, the size of Rhode Island, broke free in 1999 in a development that could presage rising oceans that would ultimately endanger many coastal cities in the United States and abroad. To the disappointment of many environmentalists, Bush decided not to sign the Kyoto Agreement, in which many nations pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to slow global warming. (Congress failed to ratify it during the Clinton administration but did ratify it in the Bush administration, only to have Bush not sign it.) Environmentalists charged the Bush administration with loosening clean air standards and other regulations. Bush also supported drilling for oil in Alaska, loosening logging restrictions in national forests, allowing higher levels of permissible arsenic levels in drinking water, easing deadlines for raising pollution standards for automobiles, and granting snowmobile access to Yellowstone National Park. Only in 2007 did Bush acknowledge that global warming might actually be in progress—partly because some fundamentalist members of his conservative coalition had come to the conclusion that it was occurring and that Christian principles mandated wise stewardship of the earth’s natural resources. Critique Bush’ s Domestic Agenda in 2003 and 2004 Even before the United States had invaded Iraq in the spring of 2003, Bush returned to his domestic agenda. Using the argument that it would stimulate the economy, he proposed an additional $700 billion multiyear tax cut in early 2003. The centerpiece of the tax legislation was a reduction in the tax on stock dividends, a change that favored affluent Americans who owned stocks. With Democrats and moderate Republicans leading the way, the Senate pared the proposed cuts to $350 billion and included some revenue- sharing funds for the states—with the conference committee approving a final version amounting to $400 billion. Liberal critics of this second tax cut made similar criticisms to it as they had made to Bush’s first tax cut. They argued that it was inequitable, with most of its benefits going to the top 10% of the nation’s most affluent persons. They argued it would not stimulate the economy since most of its benefits went to affluent Americans, even though a child tax credit was affixed to it. (Remarkably, the legislation did not provide this child tax credit to the poorest families that paid no income tax.) They argued it would exacerbate huge deficits. To their consternation, Bush’s tax cut passed when a small number of conservative Democrats voted for it. With Senator Bill Frist, the Senate Majority Leader, leading the way, the Senate developed a prescription drug measure for Medicare recipients estimated to cost $400 billion over 10 years—but one that had such limited eligibility that many seniors would still have to pay a large portion of their drug costs. The measure received bipartisan support because Senator Ted Kennedy, again deciding that half a loaf was better than none, supported it. But the House and Senate versions of the legislation were markedly different, with the House insisting that private insurance companies LO 11-5 implement the drug benefit in contrast to the Senate, which wanted to give consumers greater choice. A drug benefit was finally enacted in November 2003, when a conference committee reached a compromise solution that allowed many private drug plans to compete for seniors’ business rather than having Medicare itself administer the benefit—and by leaving a significant number of seniors to purchase their own drug benefits. The final Medicare drug prescription legislation was so complex than many critics wondered if most senior citizens would even understand it. Bush’s tax, international, domestic, and counter-terrorism policies had radically changed America’s national priorities from those that he had inherited from Clinton. He cut taxes by almost $1.7 trillion spread over 10 years. He increased military spending annually from $250 billion to $400 billion—or an increase of more than $1 trillion spread over 10 years. He devoted $70 billion annually to counter-terrorism—or at least $700 billion over 10 years. In other words, $3.4 trillion was taken from the federal budget in the coming decade that might otherwise have been used for domestic programs. These policies also resulted in huge increases in the federal debt since they led to annual federal deficits of $400 billion for years to come—deficits that would further deplete funds for domestic programs by markedly increasing annual interest payments on the federal debt. Nor would the fiscal shortfall be confined to the first decade of the 21st century due to the impending retirement and aging of the 76 million persons born between 1946 and 1964—the so-called baby boomer generation. If 12% of the population was age 65 or older in 2002, federal authorities estimated that 18% would be elderly in 2025 and 21% in 2050. * Seniors’ medical costs had already risen rapidly in the 1990s with the advent of new drugs, diagnostic tests, joint and organ transplants, and surgeries—and were slated to rise much higher in coming decades. Seniors were expected, as well, to live longer—meaning even more of them would need extended and expensive medical help for chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure. The combined costs of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid could rise, then, from 41% of the budget in 2000 to 66% of GDP in 2030—displacing other programs in the current federal budget. * Boomers’ needs will compete with the 75 million members of Generation X (born between 1965 and 1985) and the projected 75 million members of Generation Y (born between 1986 and 2006). * Members of Generations X and Y will require large increases for social services, education, and health programs, not to mention greater investments in the nation’s infrastructure. Many liberals, as well as some conservatives, feared that the nation was heading for a grim scenario. They feared that programs funded by the federal discretionary portion of the budget might be slashed since block grant programs, housing subsidies, roads, airports, the environment, the federal park service, public health, mental health, child welfare, and education programs—currently about 15% of the federal budget—are relatively small and lack the political clout of entitlements and military programs. * They feared that means-tested entitlements for the poor could be slashed, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, Food Stamps, and Supplementary Security Income (SSI). The nation could, of course, raise its federal taxes above the traditional level of roughly 20% of GDP to finance the needs of boomers and succeeding generations. As we shall see in the next chapter , controversy about federal budget priorities arose during the Presidency of Barack Obama, as well as many states when their tax revenues were depleted by the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009 and beyond. Understand the Outcome of the 2004 Election The presidential race was under way by July 2003. Nine Democratic contenders vied for the Democratic nomination after Al Gore had withdrawn from the race, including former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; Senators and ex-Senators John Kerry, John Edwards, Joe Lieberman, and Carol Moseley; black activist Al Sharpton; and Representatives Dick Gephardt and Dennis Kucinich. Democrats faced a difficult dilemma: Should they position themselves toward the liberal side of their party to present a clear alternative to Republicans, or should they follow Clinton’s centrist model? * Many critics of the Democratic Party, such as Howard Dean, believed that it had suffered losses in the 2000 and 2002 elections because it had failed to offer a liberal alternative to Republicans in both domestic and foreign policy. (Dean had opposed the war with Iraq.) These critics believed that Bill Clinton had led the party too far to the center—and even to the right with respect to such issues as welfare reform. Without an energized base of relatively liberal voters, these critics believed Democrats would again succumb to the Republicans. Democratic centrists such as Lieberman believed, by contrast, that Democratic candidates’ only chance in major elections was to run toward the center by emphasizing moderate positions on many issues, by strongly supporting Bush’s foreign policy, and by continuing to take hard lines on crime. Kerry soon took the lead by winning pivotal victories in the primaries—and clinched the Democratic nomination by early March 2004. Republicans won a narrow victory in the elections of 2004. Relying heavily on the argument that he could best safeguard the nation from terrorism, President Bush persuaded many independent and moderate voters to vote for him, while retaining the allegiance of persons with relatively strong LO 11-6 religious affiliations. Enough citizens were sufficiently worried about national security against terrorism that Bush easily defeated John Kerry. Republicans retained, moreover, their strong majority in the House, while gaining a narrow majority in the Senate. This margin of victory was not sufficient, however, for President Bush to enact many policies that he favored—leading to a policy stalemate in 2005 and 2006. He was unable to get his Social Security or Medicare reforms enacted to make them attuned to his free-market ideology, such as converting Social Security to a system of private investment accounts or enacting a system of medical savings accounts to allow persons to self-finance their health care costs rather than relying on Medicare. Unable to convince Congress to enact legislation to allow the federal government to give funds to faith-based organizations, he used his presidential power to distribute considerable resources to them. Discuss the Return to Iraq The American occupation of Iraq, which Bush had believed would be relatively brief and effortless, turned into a nightmare in 2005 and thereafter, even though Saddam Hussein was captured in December 2003 and executed in December 2006. Critics believe that the administration made a bad situation even worse by disbanding Hussein’s army when no alternative force existed for keeping order—and by deploying too few American troops. By insisting that government officials from Hussein’s era be removed from government posts, moreover, the United States contributed to the erosion of government capabilities. The United States moved too slowly to develop competent Iraqi military forces and police so that the full onus of keeping peace fell on American and (to a lesser extent) British forces. In focusing on military occupation, moreover, the United States failed to invest sufficiently in the reconstruction of Iraq so that residents of the nation often lacked such basic requirements as electricity, sanitation, and health care. A considerable portion of funds that Americans devoted to reconstruction were depleted by corruption from American and Iraqi contractors and officials. Even in 2008, many Iraqi citizens lacked rudimentary services that they had possessed before the American invasion. After a long process of writing a constitution, elections were held with a large majority of the Iraqi population voting into place a national legislature with a majority of Shiite politicians in December 2005. The national government soon proved to be relatively ineffective. It was riddled with corruption; could not decide how to divide the nation’s oil revenues among its Kurdish, Shiite, and Sunni peoples or areas; could not restrain the Shiite and Sunni militias from warring on one another; and could not build competent military and police forces. If violence before 2005 had mostly consisted of remnant forces of Hussein and local Al-Qaeda forces fighting American troops, it shifted toward tribal warfare after a particular prominent Shiite shrine was virtually destroyed by Sunni or Al-Qaeda LO 11-7 militants in February 2006. Many experts feared a full-blown civil war had emerged. Some critics wondered if the American invasion of Iraq had excessively diverted American attention from Afghanistan making a return to power by forces sympathetic with the Taliban more likely. Analyze Supreme Court Surprises and Uncertainties The Supreme Court had assumed a pivotal role in social welfare policy during the 20th century. If it was a relatively conservative court in the century’s first four decades, it became a relatively liberal court in the next three decades under the leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren. It then entered a relatively conservative phase in the last three decades of the 20th century under the leadership of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, when it favored states’ rights, pull-backs from rulings that limited the powers of police, and elimination of quotas by universities. Many liberals feared that the Supreme Court might soon end affirmative action programs and rescind the right to abortion granted in the Roe v. Wade decision. Even this relatively conservative court was deeply divided, however. Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and William Rehnquist called themselves strict constructionists who took conservative positions on most rulings, though some liberal critics contended that ideology—not a strict reading of the Constitution—shaped many of their positions. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens usually took liberal positions, sometimes joined by David Souter. A moderate faction, including Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and Stephen Breyer, were less predictable, often voting with or against the conservative or liberal judges. (O’Connor was particularly pivotal, often helping the liberal jurists to gain narrow victories in key decisions on abortion, affirmative action, and workers’ rights.) The Court was so divided that many key decisions were made by a 5 to 4 vote. If even a single liberal or moderate justice retired and was replaced by a conservative Bush nominee, liberals feared virtually all decisions would be conservative ones. LO 11-8 To the surprise of court experts, the Supreme Court made several rulings in 2003 that were relatively liberal in nature. The two rulings that received the most attention involved affirmative action and gay rights. In the case of The University of California Regents vs. Bakke , Allen Bakke, the plaintiff, contended he had not been admitted to medical school due to a quota system that selected persons less qualified than himself. While the Court ruled in Bakke’s favor in 1978 by declaring rigid quotas to be unconstitutional, it also maintained that race could be used as one of several factors in the admission process. In the ensuing decades, many conservatives hoped the Court would reverse itself by declaring any use of race to be unconstitutional. They found their chance when two Caucasian applicants, respectively to the University of Michigan’s undergraduate program and law school, sued the university on grounds that it had used unfair admission procedures. If the undergraduate program used a point- based system that automatically gave minorities one-fifth of the points needed for admission, the law school used a less structured system that made race one of a number of factors to be considered to obtain a diverse student body. Both programs insisted that students in higher education receive an inferior education if they are not exposed to different perspectives—and the law school demonstrated that the minority representation in its student body would drop to only 4% if it admitted students only on the basis of grades and test scores. * The Supreme Court struck down the undergraduate admission procedures by a 6 to 3 vote on grounds that it made race “a decisive factor for virtually every minimally qualified … minority applicant.” But it upheld the law school’s procedures by a 5 to 4 vote. Speaking for the majority, O’Connor maintained that race should have an important role in admissions since professions “must be inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity, so that all members of our heterogeneous society may participate in the educational institutions that provide the training and education to succeed in America.” * The Supreme Court struck down an undergraduate law in Texas in 2003 by a 6 to 3 vote. When police entered the apartment of Tyron Garner and John Lawrence and witnessed them performing a homosexual act, they arrested them and ultimately fined them $200. Even though the Supreme Court had upheld states’ anti-sodomy laws in a ruling in 1986, it struck down the Texas law. While only 13 states still had anti-sodomy laws, the ruling had huge ramifications for gay and lesbian persons, who now did not suffer the indignity of laws that questioned the legality of their sexual behavior. As Justice Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion, gays are “entitled to respect for their private lives.” * Understand the Botched Response to Hurricane Katrina A hurricane hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in August 2005 that was probably the most destructive natural disaster in the nation’s history. It provided a key test of the American welfare state: Could it provide a humane response to this catastrophe—and particularly to the low- income African Americans who were most harmed by it? Bush’s response to this natural disaster was problematic at best. It made Bush’s popularity plummet, allowing Democrats to make major electoral gains in 2006. LO 11-9 Review the High Stakes for the Congressional Elections of 2006 EP 5c The party that possesses a majority in specific chambers of Congress has extraordinary power. It selects the chairpersons of each of the congressional committees and its subcommittees. It prevails on many votes within committees. It prevails on many votes on the House and Senate floors. It can control the scheduling of votes by controlling the chairpersonship and the votes in the House Rules Committee. If this same party controls both the Senate and the House and the presidency, it truly has extraordinary power. The president can often secure most of his policy agenda through a Congress that is generally acquiescent when his party controls both chambers. The Republican Party enjoyed extraordinary power from 2001 through 2006 because it controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency of George W. Bush. This was true except for a brief interlude from May 2001 through 2002, when Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords defected from the Republican Party to become an independent—giving the Democrats a majority in the Senate. However, this interlude ended in the congressional election of 2002, when Republicans regained their Senate majority and widened their majority in the House. This extraordinary Republican power often meant that: LO 11-10 Only Republicans could place items on the policy agenda in the Congress. If Democrats tried to initiate policy proposals in specific committees, they usually found that their proposals were not scheduled for hearings or even discussed. Only Republicans could get legislation assigned to committees in the House, since the Rules Committee acts as a scheduler. Republican committees in the House could send bills to the House floor under “closed rules” that allowed virtually no debate or discussion. Republicans could stop investigations of many congressional activities because they controlled the chairs and the membership of oversight committees. The Republican president could mostly get his way with a Congress controlled by his own party. Had the Democrats controlled even a single chamber or the presidency, as they did during the presidency of Bill Clinton, they could at least have placed issues on the policy agendas of the committees of that chamber—or been able to use the presidential “bully pulpit” to get public support for some of their policies. While Republicans had remarkable power from 2001 to 2006, it is important to remember that moderate Republicans often voted differently from conservative Republicans on many issues—and often joined ranks with many Democrats. These moderate Republicans included, for example, Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, who, along with the aforementioned independent Jim Jeffords of Vermont, often averted spending cuts and other policies favored by conservative Republicans. Operating at the fringes of the Republican Party, however, Republican moderates in the Senate and the House often had scant influence on policies favored by the conservative mainstream of the Republican Party. Since only a small number of Republican moderates were elected to Congress in 2000, 2002, and 2004, Republican conservatives had the power to downsize many programs. They opposed Democrats’ efforts to increase the eligibility levels for federal funding of foster care, for example, so that most of its costs had to be borne by local and state governments—often leading to short funding that led to excessive caseloads for child welfare workers. They cut the Medicaid program and tried to disentitle it. They opposed increases in the minimum wage, so that it remained at its lowest level in real dollars since 1969. They proposed replacing Medicare and Medicaid with medical savings accounts, but set such low levels for these accounts that they would not cover the medical costs of many seniors and low-income persons. They made such huge cuts in taxes and increases in military spending that the nation developed huge deficits, compared with the budget surpluses that had existed at the end of Bill Clinton’s presidency. It is true that the Democratic Party and its officeholders had their own faults. They, too, could be guilty of corruption. They, too, could get the United States into ill-advised military actions abroad, as well as create a bloated military budget. Yet clear differences existed between the two parties on social legislation, with the Democrats favoring government regulations and programs to a greater extent than did Republicans. As the congressional elections of 2006 loomed, it became clear that this could be a so-called transformational election, in which one party’s dominance might be challenged. * Transformational elections do not occur very often; the last one had taken place in 1994, when Republicans took control of both chambers of Congress, as well as many governorships and state legislatures. To make the elections of 2006 transformational, Democrats would have to capture at least one chamber of Congress and reduce the size of the Republican majority in the other chamber. Even better would be to take control of both chambers. And better still would be to regain the presidency in 2008. Were Democrats to regain control of the House, they would need to have a net gain of at least 15 seats in the 435 elections for House seats—and they would need a net gain of six seats to take control of the Senate in the 33 elections for Senate seats. (Only one- third of senators come up for election during each congressional election since they serve staggered terms of 6 years compared with 2 years for members of the House.) Nobody knows precisely why transformational elections take place, but they are probably triggered by shifts in public opinion. When Republicans took control of the Congress in 1994, they were helped by scandals in the Clinton administration, Clinton’s failure to get his national health insurance legislation enacted, dislike of Hillary Clinton, disenchantment with large federal deficits, and disenchantment with long-term Democratic control of one or both chambers of Congress. Transformational elections are also triggered by high voter turnout by one party, particularly among its base of loyal supporters. Republicans were able to turn out their conservative base in extraordinary numbers in 1994— centering upon evangelical and conservative Americans in the South, Midwest, and mountain states. It was, to say the least, a political massacre —not a single incumbent Republican governor or legislator was defeated in 1994, and many incumbent Democrats were defeated—as Republicans gained solid majorities in both chambers of the Congress and in many state legislatures. Many Republicans feared that the Democrats would return the favor in the congressional elections of 2006. Even in the spring, Bush’s job approval rating had fallen to 31%. By August, public approval of Congress had fallen below 30%. Polls in October showed that Bush’s ratings had only improved slightly. Moreover, only 40% of voters believed the United States had “done the right thing” in taking military action against Iraq—and only 38% of the public believed the Republican Party “comes closer to sharing your moral values” compared with 47% for the Democrats. Remarkably, despite his efforts to publicize his counterterrorist initiatives, only 46% of persons approved of the way President Bush had handled the campaign against terrorism—down from almost 90% soon after the 2001 destruction of the Twin Towers in New York City. A solid majority of the public believed, moreover, that the Bush administration had lied to get the public to support the invasion of Iraq, such as alleging links between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda that were later found not to exist. A majority of the public believed that the Iraq War made the United States even more vulnerable to terrorist attacks by stimulating the growth of terrorist organizations in the Middle East. The Republicans were bedeviled, as well, by corruption. Jack Abramoff, a high-powered lobbyist, was indicted on multiple counts for laundering money and offering illegal kickbacks to politicians in return for helping such clients as offshore corporations and Indian casinos. Abramoff, in turn, was linked to Tom DeLay, the House majority leader—who resigned as he was indicted by Texas authorities for illegal donations of corporate money to Texas political campaigns. Bob Ney, a Republican congressman from Ohio, resigned when he became a focus for influence peddling. Even though some Democrats were likely, too, to be indicted, Abramoff had links with many more Republicans—even frequently meeting with Karl Rove, President Bush’s chief political advisor. Added to these discontents was a scandal involving Representative Mark Foley (R., Fla.) that broke in September. Foley resigned from office when e- mails that contained sexual advances on male House pages were discovered and made public. As the public perceived a cover-up of this scandal by Republican House leaders—or at least a failure to take action when informed of the congressman’s behavior—public opinion turned against both the Republican Congress and the Republican leadership. This scandal was harmful to Republicans in yet another way: It soured on the GOP many conservative voters who strongly believed in family values and who disliked homosexuality. Republicans feared low voter turnout among the very group of evangelical and conservative voters that had powered them into control of Congress and the presidency during the prior decade. Moreover, the Republicans’ problems with public opinion and their conservative base energized many Democrats who saw the prospect of substantial gains in the 2006 elections after years of bad news at the polls. Not only could they be expected to turn out in record numbers, but they gave substantial sums of money to Democratic candidates. As the fall approached, experts raised the number of districts that were toss- ups or that leaned toward Democrats. Even between August and October, the trend favored Democrats, with as many as eight additional GOP House seats estimated by experts to be “at risk” of a Democratic victory. If 40 Republican seats had been “in play” in the House in August, as many as 48 districts were now estimated to be in play. * The ultimate results would depend upon the campaign strategies of candidates in multiple districts and states. Candidates from both political parties would try to get their liberal or conservative bases to turn out in large numbers—and then to supplement them with moderate voters, whether from the ranks of the opposing party or from independent voters. Democrats who had typically focused on urban voters in so-called blue states where they had prevailed in the congressional elections of 2004, such as California and New York, realized that they would have to convince rural and suburban voters in red states that had voted strongly for President Bush in 2000 and 2004 to switch their votes to the Democratic Party. In the Senate, for example, Democrats had a chance to unseat six Republican incumbent senators in Arizona, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia—but they would need considerable votes from relatively conservative rural voters to achieve this result. Claire McCaskill, the Democratic contender for the Senate seat in Missouri against incumbent Republican Senator Jim Talent, crisscrossed the state talking with rural voters. * To get votes from relatively conservative rural persons, McCaskill chose to assert her own religious faith as well as her family values. While Democrats as a group are less likely to attend church once a week or more compared with Republicans, many of them are religious—or share the religious values of Christians, Jews, Muslims, and others. Why not, McCaskill decided, publicize her own religious background? McCaskill also criticized the administration’s prosecution of the Iraq War not just because of her personal convictions, but because she knew that the war had become unpopular with many rural voters, whose communities had borne a disproportionate share of fatalities and injuries in American military forces. Democrats discovered, as well, that rural voters often resonated to environmental and social issues that they experienced in their own communities. * Roughly 9% of the nation’s 600,000 homeless persons live in small towns—and often are homeless due to plant closures, economically distressed farms, and rising housing costs. Citizens in rural areas experience relatively high rates of suicide, mental illness, family violence, and substance abuse—issues where Democrats and moderate Republicans are more likely than conservatives to favor public spending and programs. Many citizens in rural areas realize that their communities need affordable housing that can only be constructed with federal subsidies. Many women in rural areas favor choice when women have unwanted pregnancies. By talking about these issues in rural areas, candidates such as McCaskill hoped to convert sections of red states into Democratic areas, as had already happened in a number of Rocky Mountain states stretching from Montana down to New Mexico in the 2004 congressional elections. The challenge of securing victories in close races would be magnified by the formidable resources and campaign expertise of the Republican Party. Unlike the Democratic Party, Republicans had developed a huge nationwide database on voters that contained extraordinary details about them—the details they used to target campaign literature to specific subgroups. Their database included, for example, information about which voters owned snowmobiles, so they targeted campaign literature to such persons in Michigan that asserted that the Democratic incumbent senator from Michigan, social worker Debbie Stabenow, had supported environmental regulations that limited access of snowmobile users to certain areas—an attack meant to help her Republican opponent, Detroit Sheriff Mike Bouchard, gain their votes. With extraordinary corporate contributions, as well as contributions from relatively affluent persons, the GOP usually had a significant lead over Democrats in the resources it could spend on pivotal elections. Jim Webb, the opponent against the incumbent Republican senator from Virginia, had only $424,000 in cash on hand in July, for example, compared with 15 times that amount for incumbent Senator George Allen. Another pivotal battle pitted incumbent Senator Rick Santorum (R., PA) against his opponent, Democrat Bill Casey, Jr., who was the state treasurer. This election had extraordinary symbolic importance because Santorum had become a pivotal leader among Republican conservatives in the Senate and the nation, championing anti-gay legislation and the banning of morning- after birth control pills, and strongly supporting President Bush’s foreign policy. Policy advocates’ involvement in electoral contests was particularly essential in political races that experts viewed as up for grabs. Many of these races might be settled by a mere percentage point (or less) of the popular vote. Those candidates with the most volunteers, the most house-to- house contacts, the most effective campaign literature, the most resources, and the most sophisticated use of the Internet would prevail in close elections. Social workers’ involvement in tight elections might even make the difference in some of them. While Democratic candidates often led in the polls leading up to the 2006 elections, they faced a formidable GOP machine adept at turning out votes on Election Day. Republicans had a national strategy, through phone calls and home visits, for getting nearly every Republican to vote. In the so- called 72-Hour Project in Ohio, for example, volunteers worked phone banks on October 7, when they contacted 100,000 potential Republican voters and knocked on the doors of 50,000 voters. Not to be outdone, Democratic volunteers also completed 100,000 calls. Voters’ opinions about candidates would be important, but so, too, would these practical organizing efforts. * The Democrats won a resounding victory in the 2006 congressional elections—in considerable measure because more than 60% of Americans believed that the American invasion of Iraq had been a mistake. Some voters were also critical about President Bush’s slow response to Hurricane Katrina. Not only did Democrats McCaskill, Stebanow, Casey, and Webb win, but so did many others—resulting in a substantial Democratic majority in the House and a one-vote majority in the Senate. Securing Some Initial Social Reforms and Oversight With only a one-vote majority in the Senate, Democrats looked to the leadership of Nancy Pelosi (the new House Majority Leader) to demonstrate that they could point the nation in new directions. Pelosi and Democratic leaders had a full reform agenda, including increasing the minimum wage; increasing funding for No Child Left Behind; increasing funding for S/CHIP to provide health insurance to most children from low-income families; increasing funding for veterans’ health care; eliminating funding for Cold War-era weapons; increasing funding for sex education and family planning; obtaining an Employment Non- Discrimination Act to ban workplace discrimination against persons on the basis of sexual orientation; increasing child care subsidies; and expanding eligibility for Food Stamps. Pelosi also promised legislation that would curtail lobbyists’ contributions to political campaigns (see Insert 11.4 ). Insert 1 1.4. Critical Analysis: How Important Is Macro Policy Advocacy in Elections? Does the 2006 election illustrate the importance of macro policy advocacy in elections? To address this question, ask how policy outcomes would have differed had Republicans kept their majorities in both houses of Congress in 2006. How might social workers engage in macro policy advocacy in elections? Contending that the Republican-dominated Congress had rarely held hearings about activities of the Bush administration during its first 6 years, Democratic leaders immediately launched investigations of the Iraq War, the reconstruction of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, the health care provided to returning veterans, and many other issues. They discovered billions of dollars of fraudulent expenditures in Iraq and New Orleans, as well as poor health care for returning veterans. These hearings were chaired by public officials such as Henry Waxman, the chair of the House Government Reform Committee. The Democrats’ legislative ambitions were partly realized when they quickly enacted a substantial increase in the minimum wage. Bush vetoed, however, increases in eligibility levels for S/CHIP. Their plans were also blocked by the huge budget deficits caused by the Iraq War and by Bush, who was intent on clamping down on new spending to offset the charge that he had created more national debt than any preceding president in American history. Democrats, too, found themselves diverted to unsuccessful efforts to enact legislation to require pull-out of American troops from Iraq by a specified timetable. President Bush vetoed such legislation even though many Republicans supported it in 2007—and Democrats lacked sufficient votes to secure the two-thirds majority required for Congress to override this veto. A major breakthrough took place with passage of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. If the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 had only required that private health insurance companies not establish aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits for mental health benefits, this new legislation required that their plans treat mental health and substance use disorder benefits equally with standard medical and surgical coverage with respect to out-of-pocket costs and benefit limits. This Act meant that tens of millions of Americans would receive coverage for mental health and addiction problems on equal terms with their coverage for physical problems. With some Democrats wanting rapid and complete withdrawal from Iraq and others wanting a slower withdrawal with retention of some American forces in Iraq for an indefinite period to support, train, and advise military forces of the Iraqi government, Democrats enacted a war funding bill without attaching any timetable for withdrawal—and a nonbinding resolution asking Bush to withdraw forces—which he vetoed in the summer of 2007. With public support for the war continuing to erode in the fall of 2007, growing numbers of Republicans deserting President Bush as they anticipated the elections of 2008, and public opinion polls showing a large majority of the public believed the American invasion had been a mistake, a phased withdrawal seemed possible by the spring of 2008. Like the Vietnam War four decades earlier, the Iraq War raised troubling questions about the foreign policy of the U.S. The war in Iraq had inflicted death and injury on more than 1 million residents of both countries—with little evidence that it had advanced the interests of the United States. As in the Vietnam War, the United States had squandered several trillion dollars (adding the ongoing medical costs of military personnel to the cost of military conflict). Both wars had diverted the attention of public officials from domestic and global social and economic issues for long periods of time. They had divided the nation along partisan lines, making bipartisan solutions to important problems more difficult to achieve. In both cases, an incumbent president and his top aides had manipulated the nation into war, often by presenting to the public false or misleading information. President Bush’s war on terrorism also raised troubling questions. Even Colin Powell said in 2007 that the military prison in Guantanamo, Cuba, should have been closed “yesterday” because of documented torture and abuse of alleged terrorists who had been deprived of due process. (Similar atrocities, in violation of the Geneva Accords, had taken place in American supervised prisons in Iraq, as well as in detention centers maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in many European nations.) In addition, the examination of telephone and e-mail communications of many American citizens without court approval by the American Justice Department was widely criticized by civil libertarians in 2006 and subsequently. Evaluate the Supreme Court’ s Move to the Right If the U.S. Supreme Court had been narrowly divided between liberal and conservative jurists prior to 2007—with Sandra Day O’Connor often swinging many decisions in a liberal direction with regard to abortion, affirmative action, and other issues—it had developed a solid majority of five conservative jurists by early 2007. Conservative jurists John Roberts and Samuel Alito, respectively, replaced the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist and retiring O’Connor so that, when joined with Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Anthony Kennedy, a five-judge conservative majority evolved. (Justices who usually voted in more liberal ways included Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens, David Souter, and Stephen Breyer; liberals feared their ranks would further thin if Ginsburg, 73 years of age, and Stevens, 86 years of age, retired and their replacements were appointed by a Republican president and Congress.) Liberals were dismayed by a string of rulings in 2006 and 2007. When considering litigation against the Seattle School District and the Jefferson County Board of Education in Kentucky for using race as one factor in assigning children to schools, the Court ruled that the district and the county had violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment on the grounds that some white students were denied entry to schools that the school districts wished to integrate or keep integrated. (The districts wanted, instead, to replace them with African American students.) The ruling made it unclear whether, and under what circumstances, school districts can seek integrated schools. * In another ruling, the Court ruled that the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act was constitutional—upholding for the first time in history an abortion restriction that did not contain an exception for the health of a woman. LO 11-11 Would the Court proceed, some feminists wondered, to overturn Roe v. Wade —and would the ruling embolden abortion opponents to obtain legislation in different states that might, for example, mandate the use of ultrasound of a fetus as part of the abortion-counseling process? * Advocates of gun control feared, as well, that the Supreme Court might follow the lead of a U.S. appeals court that had decided in the spring of 2007 that a ban against ownership of pistols and rifles by the District of Columbia violated the Second Amendment’s protection of the right of individuals to keep and bear arms. An array of other rulings appeared to favor corporations over workers or persons who alleged work discrimination. The swing of the Court in a conservative direction made the outcome of the 2008 presidential and congressional elections even more crucial. Were Republicans to prevail, even more conservative jurists might further buttress the conservative majority that had prevailed in many rulings in 2006 and 2007. Moving toward the Pivotal 2008 Elections Most experts agreed that voters’ perceptions of the course of the Iraq War would likely determine the outcome of the 2008 elections. It seemed in the fall of 2007 that the Democrats were more in tune with adverse public opinion about the Iraq War than were Republicans. For the first time in American history, a woman and an African American had a real chance to become president (see Figure 11.3 ). Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, the former First Lady and now U.S. senator from New York, and Barack Obama, a U.S. senator from Illinois, were the front-runners in polls and fundraising in the fall of 2007—although many other former and current public officials had also declared their candidacy, such as former Senator John Edwards, Governor Bill Richardson, and Representative Dennis Kucinich. The Democrats faced a large number of Republican candidates with Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts; Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York; John McCain, the senator from Arizona; and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, being the probable front-runners. Figure 1 1.3. AP Images/Charles Dharapak Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama make history for women and African Americans. The nation faced a pivotal election in 2008. Did it prefer the relatively liberal ideology and policy positions of the Democrats, as well as their greater inclination to withdraw from Iraq, or the more conservative ideology and policy positions of the Republicans? Would the rapid decline of popularity of President Bush before and since the congressional elections of 2006 harm the Republican candidate who was nominated by his party in 2008? Commentators such as economist Paul Krugman boldly predicted that the United States was moving in a progressive or liberal direction, citing public opinion polls averse to the Iraq War and favoring reforms such as national health insurance and rejection of privatization of Medicare and Social Security. * Columnist David Brooks, a conservative Republican, lamented the GOP’s swing to the far right, as reflected in the positions of many of its candidates for their party’s presidential nomination in 2008. If many of the Democratic candidates espoused an array of domestic reforms, for example, the Republican candidates mostly attacked government and supported privatization of Social Security, Medicare, and schools. * Identify Reluctance Illustrated in the Bush Administration To Bush’s credit, he did markedly increase federal spending for education and include important tax concessions in his tax legislation for some low- income Americans during his two terms in office. He also vastly increased American funding of programs to prevent HIV/AIDS and to help its victims in Africa and other developing nations. Funding for drugs was finally placed in the Medicare program. A serious debate had begun about how to improve the education of American youth in the wake of implementation of No Child Left Behind. However, Bush’s domestic accomplishments were very minimal, considering that he occupied the White House for 8 years. He will be most remembered and criticized for his controversial foreign policy decisions. When running for the presidency in 2016, for example, Republican Donald Trump blamed Bush for trillions of dollars of wasted resources on the Iraq War. His conservative coalition was fraying in 2008. It remained to be seen if liberals, who had made a major comeback in the elections of 2006, would reemerge into a position of political and policy prominence in the coming decade.

Selected Orienting Events 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program 2008 Election of Barack Obama along with large Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate 2009 Birth of the Tea Party 2009 General Motors bailout and forced sale of Chrysler Corporation Introduction American history has often cycled between relatively conservative and liberal eras, as previous chapters indicate. With the exceptions of the presidencies of Democrats Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, relatively conservative Republicans held the presidency from 1969 through 2008—or for almost 40 years. Americans were deluged with rhetoric and policies that extolled private markets, limited government, supremacy of states over the federal government, advocacy of lower taxes, and support for cuts on social spending. 2009 American Recovery and Investment Act (the Stimulus Plan ) 2009 Race to the Top Fund of $4.29 billion 2010 Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act 2010 Patient Protection and Af fordable Care (PPACA ) Act as amended by the Senate 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act ) of 2010 2010 Mid-term elections with sweeping Republican gains 2010 Middle Class Tax Relief Act 2012 Landslide victory of Obama that included Democrats’ expanded control of the U.S. Senate and narrow gains in the U.S. House of Representatives The federal elections of 2006, which gave Democrats narrow control of both houses of Congress, appeared to auger a shift from this extended conservative era to a more liberal one. The ensuing federal elections of 2008 gave the presidency to Democrat Barack Obama as well as huge majorities in both houses of Congress. Consider the Obama presidency as an experiment. Could a liberal president reverse the tide of history by contesting and surmounting conservative tenets? Could he accomplish this even when tested by the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression? Could he successfully address other festering problems that preceding presidents had failed to address, such as a health care system with roughly 45 million uninsured Americans and soaring costs, a poorly regulated banking system whose ill- considered policies would bring the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, an outmoded educational system, global warming, and inadequate immigration policies? Could he slow and reverse the dramatic inequality between social classes and races in the United States that would be aggravated by the economic downturn that began in 2007? Could he resolve budget battles between liberals and conservatives that were strikingly similar to ones during the presidency of Bill Clinton? Could he advance the rights of immigrants, women, gays and lesbians, and members of other vulnerable populations? Analyze the Historic Nature of Barack Obama’s Presidential Candidacy Barack Obama secured the Democratic nomination for president in August 2008 after besting Hillary Clinton in Democratic presidential primaries in the spring and summer. Beginning the primaries as an underdog to her, he was a surprise victor in the Iowa primary. After losing to Clinton in New Hampshire, he won enough other state primaries to give him an insurmountable lead by May. He achieved this by presenting himself as a relative newcomer to national politics. He promised to end gridlock in Washington, DC, by seeking bipartisan cooperation. He advocated relatively liberal policies, including reforms in health care, immigration, education, and the environment—even promising to bring national health insurance in this first term. He advocated withdrawing troops from Iraq as soon as possible, having opposed President George W. Bush’s decision to go to war with Iraq. He pledged, however, to renew and expand efforts to defeat the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan—a mission he argued that President George W. Bush had downplayed. Obama squared off against Senator John McCain (R., Ariz.), who was a formidable opponent. He was a Vietnam conflict hero who had survived years of imprisonment in the jungles of Vietnam. He had developed a reputation as a maverick Republican who sometimes teamed with liberal senators to secure legislation such as with Senator Ted Kennedy for far- reaching immigration reforms that were nearly enacted in 2007. McCain veered to the right, however, to secure the Republican nomination from opponents who wooed the Party’s conservative base. Many Republicans wanted a conservative candidate because they believed President Bush had wrongly embraced relatively liberal immigration reforms, as well as big-spending policies that had replaced President LO 12-1 Clinton’s budget surpluses with a soaring national debt. McCain continued this shift to the right during his campaign against Obama by nominating Sarah Palin, the Republican governor of Alaska, to be his vice presidential running mate. Little known outside her state, Palin quickly became a controversial figure and often stole the show from McCain. She appealed to conservative blue-collar voters, espoused pro-life policies, favored the Iraq War, supported enhanced military spending, backed deep cuts in social spending, and advocated more tax cuts. Many independent and moderate voters disliked her relatively brief record of public service and her ignorance of many foreign and domestic issues. She was lampooned by actress Tina Fey in widely watched episodes of Saturday Night Live . Obama selected Joe Biden, a seasoned veteran of the U.S. Senate, as his running mate. Obama became the first presidential nominee to make extensive use of social networking to attract and retain support from relatively youthful voters, eventually collecting the e-mail addresses of 13 million voters who were bombarded with alerts on issues, upcoming primaries, and the presidential election. Many voters, too, were intrigued by Obama’s unusual trajectory toward the presidency. He had been a community organizer before he received his law degree from Harvard University. Forswearing a lucrative career in the law, he had continued his community organizing work but soon decided to run for public office. He lost a race for a congressional seat, won a seat in the Illinois State Senate, then announced his candidacy for the presidency in early 2008. He was, moreover, the first multiracial candidate for the presidency, with a Kenyan father and a white mother. Some experts doubted that a person who identified himself as African American could win the presidency in a nation still bedeviled by racial prejudice, but Obama used his ethnicity to his advantage. He sought the vote of African Americans as someone who knew first-hand about barriers they had faced in American society. He talked about his close relationship with his mother, as well as his maternal grandfather. He discussed his unusual upbringing in Indonesia and Hawaii. His two books on his life as a multiracial citizen had drawn wide interest and a huge audience. Relatively progressive voters saw Obama as an agent for change. He voiced liberal concerns. He spoke about positive functions of government. He lauded free markets, but wanted regulations to protect citizens from their excesses, such as higher minimum wages, reversal of some anti-union regulations, and crackdowns on private health insurance companies that often withdrew coverage when enrollees became ill. Independents and moderates often viewed him as a prudent reformer. He appealed to nonpartisan voters who had tired of gridlocked government. Analyze the Causes of the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009 EP 8b The economic recovery from the stock-market crash of 2001 into 2007 was a relatively shallow one, but it was rudely interrupted by the onset of a recession in December 2007 during the presidency of George W. Bush that was declared by spring 2009 to be the worst one since the Great Depression. (We refer to it as the Great Recession in this chapter.) Problems emerged with the hedge funds of Bear Stearns in June 2007 and in a large French bank in August, but few predicted what would happen next. Housing prices began to decline in late 2007 as Merrill Lynch declared losses of $5.5 billion in October. Bear Stearns collapsed in spring 2008; the government hastily helped J. P. Morgan Funds take it over. Worry changed to panic when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on September 15; the government helped Bank of America purchase it. Many investors, economists, and public officials now believed a banking crisis to be under way that could lead to a run on the banks by depositors, as had occurred shortly after Franklin Roosevelt was elected president. By October 2008, Americans had lost “30 to 40% of their net worth on paper—several trillion dollars just evaporated.…” * Job creation had plummeted by roughly 700,000 jobs per month from September through January 2009, when Obama took office. This economic crisis was precipitated by the elimination in the 1980s, 1990s, and into the Bush administration of many federal regulations of LO 12-2 banks that had been enacted during the Great Depression and in succeeding decades that had required banks to retain considerable reserves to protect themselves against large numbers of delinquent loans and mortgages that often occur during recessions. Roosevelt’s Glass-Steagall Act had prohibited banks from engaging in speculative trading of stocks and other investments. Other housing regulations had required consumers to place substantial down payments on homes and to limit the amount of their monthly mortgage payments to a specified percentage of their net income so that they would not become financially overextended. Few experts understood that large American banks had begun a speculative spree beginning in the late 1990s, just as these regulations had been eased or eliminated in what came to be called the subprime mortgage crisis. Eagerly pocketing mounting profits, many banks and mortgage lenders issued mortgages during the Bush administration to blue-collar and other consumers who would not have qualified for them a decade earlier. Making little or no down payments, these consumers often believed they could afford these mortgages at low (or “sub-prime”) rates because housing prices continued to rise at historically unprecedented rates. They believed they would need merely to sell their homes and pocket the profits if they could not afford their mortgages—not realizing that housing prices had entered a speculative bubble that would soon burst, leaving millions of them “under water,” or owning houses that were worth far less than the mortgages that had financed them. (Houses had lost, on average, more than 25% of their value by December 2011, even exceeding the decline in housing values of the Great Depression.) Many consumers, too, had not read the fine print of their mortgages, which informed them that the mortgages balloon in coming years at much higher rates. Nor did many consumers or banks even consider what would happen if unemployment increased, as it periodically did during recessions—even to double-digit rates for an extended period. Millions of people faced foreclosure under these circumstances. As the Great Recession took hold in late 2007, foreclosures increased in late 2008 with particularly high numbers in Florida, California, and Nevada, as well as in other states with high unemployment, such as Ohio and Michigan, but continued through 2009 and 2010 ( Figure 12.1 ). Figure 12.1. Bill Clark/Getty Images People protesting against banks in 2009. The recession was also caused and worsened by bankers’ greed. Some banks began “bundling” mortgages into new financial products called mortgage-backed securities or derivatives. They sold these products to investors and other banks who assumed their value would rise as the housing markets rose. As more consumers foreclosed on their mortgages, the value of these products rapidly declined or even became worthless, leaving the banks and investors who had bought them fiscally vulnerable. These grim realities became evident in fall 2008, when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and when many large banks and investment houses teetered on bankruptcy, including American International Group (AIG), Wells Fargo, Bank of America, J. P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. (The nation’s 19 largest banks held the vast majority of the nation’s financial assets.) Two Republicans proposed far-reaching initiatives in September 2008 and convinced President George W. Bush to back them: Henry Paulson, the secretary of the Treasury and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank. They proposed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which established the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to restore stability to the financial system by allowing the Treasury Department to buy or insure up to $700 billion of these “troubled assets” from banks so that they could balance their accounting books and avoid further losses. This would enable them to remain in business to provide new loans and credit to consumers and businesses. Since TARP had to be approved by Congress, it soon became caught up in the presidential campaign between Obama and McCain. The two candidates were invited to an economic summit hosted by President Bush and Paulson to obtain their approval of this legislation and to convince other party leaders to approve it. They knew they were on precarious ground: The TARP plan was developed so hurriedly that it was only three pages long and placed few conditions on the banks that would receive $700 billion of taxpayers’ funds. Obama improved his appeal to voters by quickly supporting the legislation. He urged other Democrats to vote for its first tranche of $350 billion in loans, even though some Democrats wanted some of the big banks to be nationalized. McCain harmed his electoral chances by appearing indecisive and out of touch with the economic situation—even admitting he had not read the three-page plan. After an initial defeat of TARP in the House, Congress enacted the legislation with unanimous support from Democrats and considerable opposition from Republicans. George W. Bush signed the legislation on October 3, 2008. Acting under its own authority, the Federal Reserve Bank began to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of troubled assets from the banks with the intention of selling them in coming years. (The Federal Reserve Bank planned to buy more than $1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities by early 2011.) Bernanke kept the prime interest rate at nearly zero to help banks obtain funds from the Federal Reserve to finance their operations and make loans to businesses. At its peak at the end of 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank had made loans of roughly $1.5 trillion that had gone not only to banks, but to businesses, investors, and brokers in a frantic effort to forestall another Great Depression. * The federal government took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, huge mortgage-lending agencies in September 2008. The government committed $1.9 trillion in direct investments to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and created a program to purchase mortgage securities and debt from them. Because private investors and many banks chose not to purchase mortgages due to the drop in housing prices, by September 2009, the federal government was financing about 9 of every 10 new home loans. Many Americans had invested in money market funds; however, many of these conservative investments threatened to become insolvent after their assets dropped due to their ill-advised investments in banks and derivatives. The federal government committed $4.9 trillion to guarantee investments of consumers who held those money market funds that nearly closed after their assets dropped. The imperiled state of banks and mortgage-lending organizations made an economic recovery impossible: Consumers and businesses depended on them for loans and mortgages needed to restore economic growth. Analyze Obama’s Landslide Election in 2008 Obama further enhanced his stature with his composure and knowledge of issues in his presidential debates with McCain. Polls predicted a substantial Obama victory, but relatively few experts accurately predicted its sheer magnitude. Obama and the Democrats won their most one-sided victory since 1964. Obama carried the female vote by 13 percentage points, won 95% of the African American vote, carried the Latino vote by two-to-one, easily won the vote among persons earning less than $100,000 and more than $200,000, won 63% of the vote of persons who had not finished high school, and 58% of persons with postgraduate degrees. He won the vote of self-described moderates by 60% to 39%—and independents by 52% to 44%. He won 78% of the vote of Jews. He narrowly lost the vote of persons over age 65, however, and carried men by only 1%—and McCain won 55% of the vote of white men. Some experts believed he had achieved a generational realignment because he won 66% of voters between ages 18 and 29. * Obama’s landslide victory was partly due to a massive “ground game” that he and his aides created during the election. He mobilized thousands of volunteers who were led by paid staff in a campaign organization called “Organizing for America” (OFA). He orchestrated a large fund-raising effort. His landslide victory gave the Democrats a formidable advantage in Congress. Democrats controlled the House of Representatives with a huge majority. They gained a two-thirds Senate majority, or 60 seats, that was sufficient to prevent Republicans from blocking votes by resorting to filibusters. (A vote of two-thirds of the members is required to stop filibusters.) The size of these congressional majorities augured well for the legislation that Obama could propose in his first term: Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson had enacted many policies when presented with similar majorities in the presidential elections of 1932, 1936, and 1964. LO 12-3 Understand the First Year of Obama’s Presidency EP 3a The first year of Barack Obama’s presidency can be compared with the first year of Franklin Roosevelt’s presidency as both presidents worked with Congress to enact emergency measures to stabilize the economy and address the mounting needs of Americans. LO 12-4 The Stimulus Plan: —A Social Welfare Program in Disguise Having won the election, Obama and his economic advisors realized that they would have to initiate a massive economic stimulus to stop the Great Recession from becoming another Great Depression, as the economy was shrinking by nearly 6% annually. * Obama pushed congressional Democrats to write and enact the American Recovery and Investment Act (ARRA), which came to be known as the Stimulus Plan when Obama signed the legislation in February 2009. The Stimulus Plan was a disguised social welfare measure because its proponents focused on its effects on improving the economy rather than its actual content. It contained $787 billion—and much of this money was devoted to funding social welfare programs. It was huge, surpassing Franklin Roosevelt’s pump priming during the Great Depression when measured as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Its stated purposes were: 1. To preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery. 2. To assist those most impacted by the recession. 3. To provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health. 4. To invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits. 5. To stabilize state and local government budgets, in order to minimize and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax increases. The Plan’s resources would be staggered over several years for several reasons. There were only about $40 billion of “shovel ready” construction and related projects, so additional funds could be spent only after the necessary permits were secured. States would need help over a period of several years because their revenues had been hugely reduced by the Great Recession, including ones from property taxes, income taxes, and sales taxes. Many Americans would need help with unemployment insurance for an extended period. As many Americans lost employment, they would have to rely on the Medicaid program that could only handle its increased number of enrollees if the federal government gave resources to states to help fund it. States and localities would need federal resources to allow them to keep schools in operation, as well as to fund salaries of public employees. Resources of the Stimulus Plan were first expended in spring 2009, but they continued into spring 2011. Relatively few people realized, as well, that the Stimulus Plan funded $250 million in middle-class tax cuts. * It permanently expanded eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit to give more resources to low- and moderate- income workers and their families. It gave moderate-income people tax cuts, as well as elderly persons and veterans. It allowed middle-income families to escape the so-called Alternative Minimum Tax. If members of both parties had voted for work relief programs in the Great Depression, virtually all Republicans voted against the Stimulus Plan. They predicted it would prove ineffective in restoring economic growth, give the federal government too much power, and add to huge deficits already incurred by TARP. (Only three Republicans voted for it.) Even before it was enacted, many economists wanted the Stimulus Plan to be considerably larger, such as White House economist Christina Romer, who forecast that it should be funded at $1.1 trillion in light of the sheer magnitude of unemployment. (More jobs were lost in the Great Recession than the combined lost jobs during the recessions of 2001, 1992, and 1981.) Others wanted it to invest even more resources in rebuilding roads and bridges like New Deal programs. With nearly united opposition by Republicans to the Plan, however, it was not possible to expand its funding —a decision that may have contributed to persistent double-digit unemployment during 2009 and most of 2010. The stimulus bill also sought to advance long-term goals. It offered incentives to hospitals and physicians to develop electronic medical records. It provided grants to states and transportation agencies to develop high-speed trains. It provided grants to weatherize homes and businesses, as well as to develop technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It funded hundreds of new primary care clinics, particularly in low-income areas. The sheer scope of the Stimulus Plan is illustrated by its distribution between tax cuts (37%), state and local fiscal relief, especially Medicaid and education (18%), and federal social programs and federal spending programs (45%). The sheer range of programs and businesses funded by the Stimulus Plan by spring 2010 is revealed in Tables 12.2 , 12.3 , and 12.4 , but it was ultimately even larger. It expended 50% greater resources than the entire New Deal during the Great Depression in constant dollars, rising to a total cost of $831 billion. * It included the largest antipoverty initiatives since Lyndon Johnson and the largest tax cuts for middle-class Americans since Ronald Reagan. It gave the largest government resources to research ever. It gave the greatest resources to highways since the Interstate Highway System was established. It launched new initiatives to address homelessness. It spent vast resource on eco-friendly programs. It saved many states from bankruptcy by subsidizing many of their programs when their tax revenues had plummeted during the Great Recession. As one adviser to both presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama said, “We probably did more in that one bill than the Clinton Administration did in eight years.” * Table 12.2.

He failed to communicate effectively with the public about this vast initiative, unlike President Franklin Roosevelt who portrayed the New Deal as a humanitarian program during a period of economic decline. As Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania said, “I’m not Barack Obama, but if you gave me an hour to explain the Recovery Act to the country, I could’ve made the case!” * Rather than dividing the Stimulus Plan into a number of smaller programs that could be understood by the public, Obama and his aides decided to enact it as one package in light of the economic emergency they confronted. Continuing high unemployment made it seem to be ineffective in stimulating economic growth—an argument that Republicans repeatedly used despite findings by the Special Education 12,200,000,000 Rehabilitation Services and Disability Research 680,000,000 Student Financial Assistance 15,840,000,000 Student Aid Administration 60,000,000 Higher Education 100,000,000 Institute of Education Sciences 250,000,000 Departmental Management : Ofﬁce of the Inspector General * 14,000,000 TOTAL : 43,164,000,000 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that it had reduced unemployment significantly, by as many as 3 million jobs. * Obama failed to obtain credit for the Stimulus Plan, as well, because of relentless Republican attacks on it. They alleged that it was merely pork barrel spending, expanded the deficit, and represented government socialism. Obama failed to make the case that it has created 3 million jobs, increased economic output over 2%, and helped balance the budgets of every state, allowing them to continue to fund many public-service programs so that many teachers and first responders could keep their jobs. It helped “millions of victims of the Great Recession keep food on their tables and roofs over their heads.” * Saving Financial Institutions President George W. Bush had begun to implement the first phase of TARP, but President Obama had not only to spend the remaining balance of its first $350 billion in loans and grants to various banks but also to secure congressional approval for its second phase of $350 billion for loans to banks. This proved to be challenging because many Americans, as well as members of both political parties, increasingly viewed TARP as a bailout to institutions and corporate officials whose greed and speculation had led to the Great Recession. Some legislators wanted the government to take over the banks. Voters were angered, too, by huge salaries and bonuses that banks continued to give to many of their staff—even as they received huge loans and grants from the federal government. Obama decided to condition this new infusion of capital from the federal government by requiring banks to submit to “stress tests” conducted by the Federal Reserve to prove they were sufficiently viable to survive, insisting that they raise private capital equal to at least half the amount they had borrowed through TARP, and making them place temporary restrictions on executive pay. The stress tests conducted on the nation’s 19 largest financial institutions reassured many Americans because the banks fared relatively well on them after having received TARP funds. Obama also “jaw-boned” the banks to cut salaries and bonuses as long as they received federal assistance. He criticized them for ill-considered speculative practices that led to the downturn of the economy in the first place. In addition to TARP and the Stimulus Plan, Obama had to deal with the fiscal problems of General Motors and Chrysler Corporation at a time when American auto sales had plummeted from 15 million to 8 million cars per year. Many Americans were critical of top executives in these companies since they had been unable to compete successfully with Japanese, Korean, and European carmakers for decades and had received outsized pay for their poor performance. After extended congressional hearings, the Obama administration invested directly in General Motors with TARP funds, bringing the government’s ownership share to 60%, initiated a “cash for clunkers” program to give incentives to owners of old cars to buy a new vehicle, and convinced Fiat to buy a significant share of Chrysler. (Only Ford Motor Company chose not to receive government subsidies.) The Obama administration required General Motors and Chrysler to radically restructure themselves and to build more fuel-efficient cars. Few Americans fully realized the sheer extent of federal involvement in the economy by September 2009—or less than a year after Obama took office. When considered together, TARP, the actions of the Federal Reserve Bank, and other initiatives eventually committed more than $12.5 trillion to protect the economy in the largest expenditures in American history in such a brief span of time. These included: $290 billion in direct investments in banks $700 billion in TARP funds Up to $3.2 trillion in short-term loans, guarantees on bank debt and deposit accounts, and insurance against losses for Citigroup and Bank of America Up to $2 trillion to provide cheap financing to investors to buy troubled mortgage securities and bonds backed by business and consumer loans $83 billion in loans to General Motors and Chrysler and their suppliers, as well as $3 billion for the “cash for clunkers” program to subsidize consumers’ selling old cars to buy new ones Over $700 billion for the Stimulus Plan—some of which financed investments in this list $183 billion of direct investments in AIG * Many Republicans had opposed the second phase of TARP, as well as subsidies and loans to automobile companies. They contended that these huge expenditures would prove ineffective—and that they represented unwarranted intrusion by the government in private markets. Data appeared to confirm the Democrats’ views by late 2010. The nation’s major financial institutions had not only survived, but had repaid virtually all of the TARP loans and grants, making its actual cost about $30 billion. General Motors moved from huge losses to profits by spring 2010, issued a huge public offering of stock in fall 2010—and repaid a significant part of the government’s loans and grants to it. The government not only saved the jobs of many autoworkers at a time when roughly 12% of American workers were unemployed, but workers in scores of companies that make parts for new cars, as well as persons who worked many dealerships. These developments confirmed Obama’s contention that he did not want an ongoing role in private markets but merely wanted to restore the viability of banks and automobile companies so that they could augment the nation’s economic growth. Obama’s Personal and Political Style Obama is a highly ambitious person. Not content with his seat in the Illinois State Senate, he cleverly obtained endorsements that allowed him to run for the U.S. Senate—and then elicited support from Senator Ted Kennedy and other high-ranking politicians for his run for the presidency. He had the audacity to run against Hillary Clinton in 2008 even when she was far better known and financed than himself. He was determined to enact major reforms that would place him in the top ranks of American presidents. Obama was tested from the outset of his presidency by the most polarized politics since Newt Gingrich led Republicans to their landslide congressional victory of 1994. Pledged to achieve bipartisanship, Obama discovered that Republican leaders like Senator Mitchell McConnell (R., Ky.) and Representative John Boehner (R., Oh.) had embraced a tactic of all-out opposition to virtually every presidential initiative. Republicans had voted unanimously against the Stimulus Plan in the House, with only moderate Republican Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins supporting it in the Senate. Many Republicans voted against the second phase of TARP. Conservative media commentators on FOX News such as Glenn Beck as well as talk radio commentators such as Rush Limbaugh depicted Obama as a socialist, fascist, and communist. Some even argued that he should be removed from the presidency because he had not been born in America (despite his campaign’s release of his Hawaiian birth certificate). Republican leaders, such as Mitch McConnell in the Senate and John Boehner in the House, decided early in Obama’s presidency to try to deny policy successes to him so that Republicans would regain lost seats in the 2010 congressional elections—and possibly defeat Obama in the presidential election of 2012. * Republican leaders had adopted a similar strategy in the first term of Bill Clinton when they decided to vote against his health legislation in 1993 before Clinton and Democrats had even developed it, as we discussed in Chapter 10 . Obama was hardly a pushover, however, in this embattled political context. He hired Rahm Emanuel to be his chief of staff. Emanuel was an abrasive and hard-driving public official who had a vast network in Congress from having worked for President Bill Clinton and served as a member of the House of Representatives. He had personally recruited many moderate Democrats to run for the House and the Senate in relatively conservative districts and states in 2006—and many of them had won their races. He was not an ideologue since he wanted to put “points on the board” with quick, numerous victories in Obama’s first years of the presidency even if relatively conservative compromises were needed to get them enacted. He worked closely and effectively with Democrats Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader. * Like Emanuel, Obama favored a quick-hit strategy when he used his huge majorities in Congress to secure many policy victories prior to the 2010 mid-term elections, when most incumbent presidents lose many seats to the opposing party. Unlike Emanuel, however, he wanted to enact major legislation like national health reforms. Obama is both an idealist and a realist. * As an idealist, he sought the presidency to seek major policy reforms rather than minor measures. He was profoundly influenced by Martin Luther King, whose portraits adorn his office. He was aware that he, like many African Americans, stood on King’s shoulders since their success would not have occurred without the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. He found inspiration from Abraham Lincoln’s commitment to preserving the union and emancipating slaves. He wanted to enact health, financial, immigration, climate-control, and educational reforms on the scale of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Obama’s quest to enact major reforms was bolstered by his belief that social and economic problems intersect with one another. When critics contended that he should have focused on the nation’s economic crisis rather than undertaking health and other reforms, he countered by arguing that health, education, transportation, and climate legislation do greatly influence the nation’s economy. The United States could only increase its economic growth in the long term, he argued, if its citizens were well educated and healthy and if its health system did not continue to drain excessive resources from the broader economy. The nation’s economic growth required alternative forms of energy that would make the United States less dependent on petroleum imports. The nation could not compete with the economies of other nations, he argued, if it did not adopt education reforms to increase the number of workers with the requisite skills for positions in its corporations. He was dismayed by economic disparities that he found ethically offensive in an affluent nation. He believed that government should use its spending, taxing, and regulatory powers to reduce these disparities, which had grown considerably during the past four decades—and during the Great Recession. Unlike many Republican presidents who had preceded him, he did not disparage the nation’s safety net programs, such as the Food Stamp Program, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), subsidized child care, unemployment benefits, and Section 8 housing. Nor did he disparage government, contending in many speeches that all Americans rely on government for many amenities including education, infrastructure, collecting and using taxes for constructive purposes, social programs, law enforcement, and national defense. His defense of government contrasted with attacks on government from Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush, as well as Bill Clinton, who pledged to “change government as we know it” when he ran for the presidency in 1992. From his work as a community organizer on the south side of Chicago, Obama was acutely aware of the plight of many blue-collar workers who had lost employment because corporations had downsized or moved their operations to other nations. He realized that many of these workers and families needed safety-net programs, as well as education and job-training programs that would upgrade their skills. Obama announced early in his presidency that he wanted to increase the number of Americans receiving community-college and college degrees to the rates of many other nations that had surpassed American graduate rates from post-secondary institutions. Obama was also an idealist who wanted to improve the political process in Washington, DC. He pledged to curtail political gridlock in the nation’s capital and to work with Republicans. He attacked earmarks where politicians place favors for constituents in bills. He promised to instill rational discourse into the halls of Congress. He persisted in wanting bipartisanship even when some of his aides argued with him that this idealism was doomed to failure in a nation that had become increasingly polarized during recent decades. He brought into the White House key aides who shared this idealism, such as David Axelrod, Valerie Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, and David Plouffe. * Obama as a realist often asked himself, “How can I get (Republican leader John) Boehner to agree (and) how can I have a reasonable conversation with Boehner (and) how can I make Boehner see it’s in both of our interests to do this or that.” * Obama realized he would have to deal with powerful special interests whenever he proposed major legislation, whether private insurance companies, huge pharmaceutical companies, financial institutions, or trade unions. He brought into the White House “survivalists” who were skilled at political tactics and setting realistic goals including Vice President Joe Biden, Rahm Emanuel, Pete Rouse, and Phil Schiliro. * Obama attacked corporate leaders for their greed and hypocrisy, and for placing politics over the nation’s well-being during the passage and implementation of TARP. He attacked insurance companies when seeking health reforms. He out-maneuvered political opponents such as Hillary Clinton and John McCain during the presidential campaign of 2008. He attacked liberals for not being sufficiently pragmatic to accept compromises at strategic times when he sought health and financial reforms. Conflict often took place between idealists and realists in the White House Staff. Idealists wanted enactment of major reforms even when their chances appeared dim, while realists questioned their feasibility. * Over the strong opposition of Emanuel, as well as Vice President Biden, for example, Obama decided to pursue national health insurance in his first year, despite its earlier defeat in the Clinton administration. He referred to the plight of his mother who had become financially stressed by medical bills when she developed cancer—as well as the medical hardships of many other Americans he had met during the campaign. He criticized unfair practices of health insurance companies in many speeches, such as ending coverage for persons when they developed serious health conditions or when they had preexisting conditions. He lambasted them for raising rates of insurance exorbitantly, such as 40% in a single year. It would be immoral, he argued, not to seek health reforms under these circumstances, even if he might not succeed. Obama was determined to fulfill many of his other 502 campaign promises. The tension between idealism and realism was manifested in Obama’s character and decisions, as well. He initiated major legislation even when warned not to proceed, but he entered the political trenches, when necessary, to fashion compromises to break legislative logjams. He appealed to basic values of the nation on repeated occasions. Yet he often acted and spoke in ways that were in accord with realists in the White House and Congress. He was adept at playing the political game. He often made concessions to Democratic and Republican opponents of his legislation, staking out positions “in the middle.” He often criticized liberals for lacking sufficient flexibility to accept specific compromises. He lambasted Republicans for their chronic obstructionism, labeling them “The Party of No.” He repeatedly attacked John Boehner as the 2010 mid-term elections approached, reproaching him for his repeated efforts to sabotage health and financial reforms. Obama even accepted earmarks in legislation in order to secure votes, such as hundreds of them in the federal budget that was enacted in fall 2009. Obama’s “Zen-like personality” was yet another aspect of his complex character. He was outwardly calm even during tense situations and in the wake of setbacks as campaigner and as president. * He often engaged in debates on policies in a scholarly way—almost like he was leading a seminar. Unlike Clinton, Obama was not inclined to “schmooze.” He often hung out with his own staff members, failed to socialize with members of Congress from either major party, and failed to thank donors. * The Frustrating Battle against Foreclosures Owning a home has long been an important part of the American dream. It was not surprising, then, that many persons of moderate means bought homes in the decade preceding the Great Recession with the enticement of low mortgage interest rates and small down payments. The dream soon became a nightmare, however, for many as housing values fell, people lost their jobs, and mortgage interest rates rose for most subprime mortgages. Foreclosures not only harmed these homeowners, but depressed entire neighborhoods when they included many foreclosed homes—homes that often fell into disrepair and were often vandalized. Foreclosures created a vicious circle: As more foreclosed homes entered the market, they depressed the value of other homes, making it more likely that their owners would also foreclose on them. To forestall foreclosures, the Obama administration established a $75 billion program called the “Making Home Affordable Program” to give resources to homeowners at risk of foreclosure and to urge banks to make trial modifications in the terms of their mortgages. This program assumed that many persons could then resume their mortgage payments—an untenable assumption for many who lacked the funds to do this even when they were employed. As unemployment rates stayed above double-digits through 2009 and well into 2010, many homeowners were even less able to make their payments—and many experts predicted even higher numbers of foreclosures in 2011. Some critics of Obama’s approach wondered why banks were not pressured to change the terms of mortgages that had often been sold to homeowners who lacked resources to pay for them, such as by enacting a law that required the use of mediators to negotiate changes in the terms of mortgages favorable to homeowners to prevent foreclosures. The Obama administration was not bolder partly because of pressure from banks not to make them ease mortgage terms, but also widespread animus toward homeowners who had unwisely secured mortgages that they could not afford. This argument would have more merit, however, if millions of homeowners had not been enticed by banks and mortgage lenders to obtain these mortgages, often without even telling them the risks that they might encounter or giving them false information.Attacking Unemployment The Stimulus Plan was the Obama administration’s attack against unemployment. It created jobs by giving states resources to avert layoffs in education and other service programs; by creating construction, research, and manufacturing jobs; and by extending and enlarging safety net programs. It also created jobs indirectly, in a so-called multiplier effect. As people spent money from extended unemployment benefits, for example, they bought goods and services that created jobs in retail stores, auto repair shops, and many other places. There were several possible reasons why the Stimulus Plan was not able to prevent the nation from falling below double-digit unemployment until well into 2010. It lacked the magnitude to offset unemployment in the worst recession since the Great Depression. Its effects were somewhat offset by huge layoffs in state and local government, particularly as federal subsidies to states subsided in late 2010 and into 2011. (Many states continued to reduce their spending due to declining revenues from the economic downturn.) The housing debacle created a huge loss of jobs among realtors, construction, and trades persons, and manufacturers who sold appliances and materials used in homes. Obama tried to reignite policies to stimulate the lagging economy in spring 2010 by proposing the HIRE Act to provide tax credits to small businesses that hired new workers. He proposed funding this Act with $150 billion, only to encounter Republican opposition to a measure of this magnitude. He finally received support from 13 Republican senators to allow funding of $17.5 billion—a mere pittance, critics argued, when contending with double-digit unemployment. Obama’s Foreign Policy Obama believed that the United States had developed an unsustainable foreign policy due to its many open-ended commitments around the globe. He was particularly critical of President George W. Bush’s decision to invade Iraq when no credible evidence existed to link its government to Al Qaeda or to weapons of mass destruction. These commitments led, he argued, to huge military expenditures that had to be curtailed to cut the nation’s deficits and to free up resources for domestic needs. Obama was not, however, an isolationist or a pacifist, as he made clear in a speech he gave when he received the Nobel Prize for Peace in fall 2009. He had a duty as president, he argued, to protect the nation from foreign threats. He made clear that he placed antiterrorism high on his agenda, including defeating Al Qaeda. Obama worked on two fronts. He quickly committed the nation to withdraw troops from Iraq over a 19-month period, leaving less than 50,000 troops by August 2010 that would mostly assume back-up functions for revitalized Iraqi military forces. The Iraqis held a national election in March 2010 that led to a near-tie between a Sunni and a Shiite candidate, but they had finally established a coalition government by late 2010. If the nation did not split asunder and return to civil war, it seemed possible that it might be able to self-rule and to contain the remnants of Al Qaeda. Obama faced an even more difficult obstacle in Afghanistan, where the Taliban had reoccupied large areas and retained outposts in the tribal areas of Pakistan where many of its members and leaders had fled. Obama developed a plan in liaison with the U.S. military and Congress in fall 2009 to triple American troops in Afghanistan, bringing their total to 100,000. He established a 16-month withdrawal deadline (July 2011) made feasible by training Afghanis to battle the Taliban and by curtailing corruption in the Afghan government. It soon became clear, however, that Afghanistan would pose even more problems than Iraq. It lacked a tradition of central governance due to its division into tribes. Many government officials were corrupt, including its president, Hamid Karzai. It was more costly and difficult for the United States to supply its troops due to Afghanistan’s inaccessibility. It remained difficult to induce Pakistan’s leaders and military forces to pursue Taliban leaders who had sought refuge in Pakistan’s remote tribal areas. It was not surprising, then, that Obama soon pushed the date of American withdrawal to summer 2014. Obama’s Afghanistan policies were opposed by many Democrats, who believed they were doomed to failure—much as the British and Russians had finally had to withdraw from the nation when they proved unable to secure their policy objectives. Neither his Afghanistan nor Iraq policies attracted much attention in the federal elections of 2010, however, when they were eclipsed by concern about the nation’s economy. It remained certain, however, that the United States and Europe remained the target of terrorists, even if Al Qaeda had not attacked the nation since the Twin Towers. A Nigerian nearly destroyed a jet about to land in Detroit with a bomb hidden in his underwear in December 2009. Several bombing attacks occurred in Europe. Obama hoped to decrease the likelihood of terrorism by improving the image of the United States in the Muslim world. As the son of a Muslim who had spent part of his childhood in a Muslim nation (Indonesia), Obama reached out to Muslims through speeches, such as ones delivered in Prague and in Cairo. He insisted that Americans fight Muslim extremists, not Muslims in general. He defended the right of a Muslim leader to place a Muslim place of worship near the Twin Towers in New York City, drawing the ire of many people. He criticized discrimination against Muslims He banned torture of anyone imprisoned for terrorism in a reversal of the policies of the Bush administration. He pledged to close Guántanamo Bay, the American military base in Cuba that was used to house terrorist suspects, and began to gradually move these suspects to other nations or to American prisons after granting many of them trials. He proved unable to close this base even well into his second term, however, due to opposition from congressional Republicans. Many experts feared that terrorists might obtain nuclear material that could be used to make lethal bombs that could render even large cities uninhabitable for years, as well as kill large numbers of persons. Many of these materials were in Russia and parts of the former Soviet Union at the sites of abandoned military bases and nuclear plants. President Obama greatly increased cooperation with the Russian government in locating these materials and removing them from places where terrorists could obtain them. He also wanted to renegotiate the START treaty that had placed limits on intercontinental missiles of the United States and Russia that had been signed by President George H. W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev—but that had expired in September 2009. He signed a new and more stringent set of limits on intercontinental missiles in 2010 with Dmitri Medvedev, the president of the Russian Federation, only to face the daunting challenge of obtaining its approval from the U.S. Senate. Unlike Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, who had spurned international treaties to control the climate, as well as the U.S. Senate, which had failed to approve the landmark 1997 Kyoto Protocol that had established binding international restrictions on carbon emissions, Obama wanted to move the United States to the forefront of environmental controls. He went to an international conference in Copenhagen in late 2009 where developing nations and developed nations were in a deadlock—and convinced China to issue data about its emissions and targets for reducing them in an international registry. He stated America’s commitment to cut carbon emissions by 17% by 2020 and 80% by 2050 with increasing use of alternative energy sources. A nonbinding Copenhagen Accord was ratified that provided a starting point for the next climate conference in Cancun in 2010. * Nations attending the Cancun Conference agreed that developed nations would make resources available for climate-control measures by developing nations and accepted the goal of cutting carbon emissions by 40%. This goal was not binding, however. Ominously, public officials on many Pacific islands reported that rising seas had already begun to seriously erode their beaches. Moreover, many scientists predicted that seas could rise by 3 to 6 feet within a century at the minimum—and possibly far more in a development that would endanger large areas of Florida, Manhattan, and New Orleans. Evaluating Obama’s First Year in Ofﬁce By December 2009, Obama had made excellent progress in fulfilling his campaign promises, according to PolitiFact.com , a fact-checking database. He had kept 91 of 502 promises and had made progress on another 285. He had broken 14 promises and stalled on another 87 of them. * Even more impressive, Obama had kept 20 of 25 of his most significant promises or they were “in the works.” * The promises he kept included investing in high-speed rail and alternative energy sources, expanding Ameri-Corps, stimulating growth of not-for-profit organizations by investing in them, increasing crime prevention in New Orleans, and education reforms. He convinced Congress to enact the second, $350 billion tranche of TARP funds, also. The stimulus bill gave Obama the chance to expand the nation’s safety net programs in many ways not realized by many of his political opponents. When a congressman told Michelle Obama that the stimulus bill was a huge antipoverty program, she said “Shhh!” to him. * He permanently expanded EITC under the stimulus bill, with wage supplements of up to $6,000 to the working poor, extended unemployment benefits to 33 weeks, expanded Food Stamps, and gave $50 billion in “stabilization funds” to states and localities that were often running huge deficits. He greatly increased federal funding of Medicaid. He extended unemployment benefits. He increased AmeriCorps, which gave young people jobs working for public and non- public agencies. Had Obama created separate programs for each of these initiatives rather than including them in the stimulus bill, he would have received far greater credit for them, such as Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson received for the scores of programs that they created. * Still pending at the end of 2009 were measures to provide universal health insurance and financial regulations where proposals had been approved by Congress in late fall. Obama had made impressive gains in foreign affairs with the assistance of Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state and Bob Gates as his secretary of defense. He had established a positive tone for American international climate negotiations. Polls indicated that Americans were seen in a more positive light by Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Asians than during the preceding presidency—even if they showed considerable backsliding in the Middle East by mid-2010. Obama had not, however, made sufficient progress in creating jobs and decreasing foreclosures. He hadn’t stimulated enough lending by small and mid-sized banks to small employers, who provided roughly two-thirds of all jobs in the United States. It was unclear whether the economy would markedly improve in 2010 or continue to stagnate. He had not enacted health care or financial reforms. Identify Major Policy Enactments in Obama’ s Second Presidential Y ear EP 5c It seemed to many onlookers that Obama’s presidency would be a failure as he neared the end of its first year. This verdict was premature, however, because he obtained dramatic policy victories in its second year. LO 12-5 Pivot Point Obama’s presidency approached a pivot point in early 2010. Public opinion polls indicated that the public had positive views of Obama at the outset of his presidency, but his job-approval ratings had fallen considerably by the end of the year as the recession failed to improve (even if his personal reputation remained at a higher level than most preceding presidents into their second year in office). Many Americans increasingly viewed the recession as his problem, even though it had begun before he took office. Americans were also bothered by the increasing gridlock between Democrats and Republicans, which Obama had promised to end. Some Americans viewed Obama as causing the nation’s growing budget deficits. Some Americans wanted Obama to focus on alleviating the Great Recession rather than on health reform or reforms to limit carbon dioxide emissions. Obama was increasingly attacked by liberals. Some didn’t like his decision to increase troop commitments to Afghanistan. Some believed he had failed to provide sufficient leadership in health care by letting Congress take the lead while he stayed on the sidelines. Others had wanted an even larger stimulus bill, contending that it was insufficient to staunch the recession. * Obama decided to seek major reforms in early 2010 rather than slowing his quest. He knew he possessed the 60 votes in the Senate needed to avert a filibuster as well as a huge majority in the House. He knew that presidents often found it easier to enact reforms earlier in their presidencies than in later years, since their political power diminishes with the passage of time ( Figure 12.2 ). Figure 12.2. Kristof fer Tripplaar/Alamy Stock Photo President Obama speaks about his plan for health care reform at the 2010 Healthcare Summit. In his January 2010 State of the Union address, Obama recommitted himself to health reform as well as major banking regulations, immigration reforms, and environmental reforms. He challenged Republicans to rise above partisanship. He made these vows despite even more vitriolic criticism from Republicans—and the continuing efforts by their leadership to sabotage virtually any reforms that Obama proposed. In truth, Obama’s presidency and legacy were on the line: If he could not enact major reforms in 2010 even with huge Democratic majorities in both Houses of Congress, he might be viewed as a second-tier president. If he succeeded in enacting some of them, however, he might eventually be compared with Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. The Republicans’ Stroke of Luck Republicans were dispirited in the wake of the Democrats’ landslide victories in 2008 that resulted from their inroads into virtually every demographic, including blue-collar voters, the elderly, youth, and persons of color. A new movement on the right appeared from nowhere, however, in February 2009, when Rick Santelli, a conservative reporter for CNBC, promised a “Chicago tea party” by asking, “How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor’s mortgage [when he has] an extra bathroom and can’t pay the bills?” Santelli’s criticism of Obama’s quest to help homeowners avert foreclosure resonated with many conservatives. Keli Calender, a young conservative teacher in Washington State, became the first Tea Party organizer, and was followed by many others in specific areas. With backing from Fox media and talk radio, small tea parties grew to huge rallies in spring 2009 and escalated to town meetings with tens of thousands gathered on the Washington Mall in September. * Tea Party members were mostly Caucasians from blue-collar and moderate-income groups. John Boehner, the Republican’s House minority leader, quickly realized that Tea Party activists were nearly as critical of the Republican Party as the Democratic Party. They criticized the ballooning of the national debt during the Presidency of George W. Bush, as well as the extensive use of earmarks and marked increases in domestic spending. Boehner decided that Republicans had to “get out in front” of the Tea Party to coopt it into their political strategy for the 2010 congressional elections. * He cultivated their leaders. He persuaded them that Republicans were preferable to Democrats, citing the Stimulus Bill as an example of their excessive spending. He linked them to young Republican leaders such as Eric Cantor, Kevin McCarthy, and Paul Ryan who militantly opposed Obama’s policies—and who wanted far-reaching conservative reforms such as reforming Medicare to a program that would provide beneficiaries with vouchers to purchase their own health care. * The Tea Party presented the Republicans with challenges as well as opportunities. They were more conservative than many Republicans, so they challenged many of them in their primary elections in 2010. Even so, they bolstered Republicans’ fortunes because these insurgents ran as Republicans rather than as members of a third party—a move that would have diminished Republicans’ electoral strength. They added energy and passion to the Republican Party, whose members increasingly believed they could undo the Democrats’ landslide victory of 2008 in 2010 and possibly challenge Obama himself in 2012. Rescuing Health Care Reforms After Bill Clinton’s failure to enact health reform in 1994, many Democrats remained gun-shy about trying again. Might the same convergence of opposition from Republicans, pharmaceutical companies, and insurance companies doom it once again? Obama had promised to back health reform during his campaign, but remained vague about its details. Over the opposition of Emanuel and Biden, as well as other top advisors, Obama insisted that Democrats try again: The health system was broken, providing no or inadequate care to roughly 45 million uninsured Americans and poor quality care to many Americans. Obama thought it would bankrupt the nation if health costs rose in the coming decade to more than 20% of GDP. In his opinion, the American health system was ethically offensive because of the sheer number of uninsured people. On the campaign trail, he had been frequently accosted by people with horror stories about their lack of coverage, the abusive policies of insurance companies, and the overall unaffordability of health care. Unlike Bill Clinton, who had put Hillary Clinton in charge of developing a proposal, Obama decided to let congressional committees decide what legislation to enact in 2009. Emanuel negotiated concessions from pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, hospitals, and health plans amounting to several hundred million dollars in exchange for assurances that their industries would not be excessively regulated. It was a clever tactic that meant that these industries would not sabotage the legislation (as had happened to Clinton’s proposed health reforms more than 15 years earlier). In spring and summer 2009, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top House Democrats made progress on legislation that eschewed a nationalized health system for a regulated market-driven one, much like the health reforms that had been enacted in Massachusetts years earlier. The legislation proposed that in 2014 states establish “insurance exchanges” to allow uninsured consumers, as well as businesses, to purchase insurance coverage that provided basic coverage. (Individuals and businesses would be mandated to insure themselves and their employees—or they would have to pay penalties to states that would use the funds to insure them.) It proposed that states regulate insurance companies so that they could not deny coverage to persons with preexisting conditions, deny coverage to persons who became ill after they had purchased their policies, or impose exorbitant rate increases. The House legislation anticipated rapid growth of Medicaid by 2014 as its eligibility would be raised to include single persons as well as any resident earning less than 133% of the federal poverty standard. House legislators greatly increased health prevention by increasing Medicare’s coverage of primary care and providing resources for primary care clinics. The House version contained a so-called “public option,” where state exchanges would include an insurance plan financed by state governments to provide competition for private insurance companies. Many of the health reforms would not take effect until 2014 and beyond to restrain their costs and to be more certain that they would not contribute to the growth of the government deficit, as Obama had required. The health reforms would be financed partly by taxes on the so-called “Cadillac” health plans of some Americans, as well as taxes on investments and incomes of affluent Americans (such as couples earning more than $250,000). The legislation’s progress was much slower in the Senate than in the House. There, hearings chaired by Senator Max Baucus (D., Mont.) droned onward through the summer as he tried, with little success, to gain the support of key Republicans as well as moderate Democrats. Baucus missed successive deadlines to develop a legislative proposal because of controversy about the public option, which was viewed as involving the government in the insurance industry. Some Republicans and Tea Party members charged that health reform would establish “death panels” that would determine which seniors would or would not receive treatment, even though in truth the legislation merely reimbursed physicians to discuss end-of-life options with their patients—a policy already mandated by the federal Patient Self- Determination Act of 1990. Some legislators contended that the health proposal would ration medical care, even though it merely provided incentives for physicians to use evidence-based medicine. So fearful was Emanuel that Congress would prove incapable of developing health legislation that he tasked his staff with writing a secret health proposal (that totaled more than 800 pages) that Obama might introduce to the Congress if the Senate remained gridlocked. * Health reforms narrowly passed the House in early November 2009, but only after Speaker Pelosi drew the animus of feminists by agreeing to an amendment by Representative Bart Stupak (D., Mich.) that outlawed the financing of abortions. Problems remained in the Senate, however, with the defection of the sole remaining Republican moderate, Senator Snowe. (Republican senators feared they would face primary battles by Tea Party candidates or conservative Republicans if they supported health care reforms.) Democratic Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska agreed to support the legislation only when promised huge federal subsidies for his state’s Medicaid program—a concession attacked by Republicans. The Senate finally passed legislation on December 21, 2009, that was similar to the House version but was more conservative and lacked the public option. Even with the enactment of the House and Senate versions, many experts doubted that Obama could obtain final legislation due to a grid-locked Congress. Obama and his aides gamely tried to convince House and Senate Democrats to make concessions to one another and had made some progress when an unexpected event appeared to doom health reform—the victory of Tea Party and Republican candidate Scott Brown to fill Senator Ted Kennedy’s vacated seat in Massachusetts. (He had died the preceding summer.) Obama and top White House aides had assumed that Democrat Martha Coakley would win the seat, but her lackluster campaigning contributed to her stunning defeat. This defeat meant that the Democrats no longer had a filibuster-proof Senate, allowing Republicans to defeat health care by initiating a filibuster. This upset election created “a mood almost of mourning inside the White House” not just because of its adverse effect on health care, but because it signaled growing public disenchantment with Obama and Democrats. * House and Senate Democrats could only surmount this obstacle if they came to see Republicans as their primary foe rather than the members of the other chamber. They developed this solidarity partly because of a White House summit called by Obama to allow leaders from both parties to express their views about health care reforms. As Republican leaders expressed their complete opposition to any major health care reforms, Democrats from the House and Senate became determined to press onward as they realized that Republicans meant to destroy Obama’s presidency by defeating his most important initiative. They coalesced behind a novel strategy. Pelosi convinced members of the House to enact the relatively conservative Senate version of health care reform and Reid convinced senators to enact some more liberal provisions of the House version under parliamentary procedures used during the reconciliation process that we discussed in Chapters 9 and 10 that only required a simple majority vote and that was not subject to filibuster. If the House agreed not to include a “public option” in the legislation, the Senate agreed to various House provisions that raised its costs somewhat. The resulting legislation was called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 as amended by the Senate—commonly called the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in succeeding years. Critics on both the left and the right criticized this legislation. Some liberals had wanted a nationalized health system like those of Canada and Great Britain. Many conservatives wanted to enact “health savings accounts” to give health insurance to uninsured persons even if they would have reduced the number of uninsured persons by a relatively small number. Despite its imperfections, most health experts hailed the legislation as a positive development since it would give insurance to 32 million additional Americans by 2014, end many abuses of private insurance companies, increase competition among private insurance plans, fund or expand hundreds of primary clinics in medically underserved areas, increase the coverage of the Medicaid program, require coverage of health prevention by private and public insurances and programs, and encourage the use of evidence-based medicine. The nonpartisan CBO estimated, as well, that the reforms would cut the federal deficit significantly during the next decade, not only because it would cut some health costs by providing more preventive care, but because it would be financed by new taxes on the incomes of affluent Americans and taxes on expensive health plans, as well as make large cuts in Medicare by cutting its reimbursements of providers. Many Republicans threatened almost immediately to “repeal” the legislation—and made this a rallying cry for the upcoming 2010 congressional elections. Many Republican attorney generals in different states brought suit against the provision in the legislation that mandated Americans to purchase health insurance or face penalties. (Contradictory rulings came forward by December 2010 from various federal judges that strongly suggested that the U.S. Supreme Court would make the final decision.) Most experts agreed, however, that Republicans would not be able to repeal the legislation while Obama was in office because he would veto any legislation that proposed to repeal it. Enacting Bank Regulations and Consumer Protections Presidents George W. Bush and Obama had successfully bailed out the banks, but Obama and his economic advisors feared that banking executives might continue their speculative practices unless they were outlawed by government regulations. This proved to be difficult, however, due to the sheer size and complexity of banking and investment operations, an army of bank lobbyists on Capitol Hill who were determined to prevent or limit federal banking regulations, and the opposition of most Republicans. Nancy Pelosi and Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, succeeded in drafting a 1,300-page bill in fall 2009 that had the authority to break up financial firms if they became so large that they could endanger the economy if they neared bankruptcy. It levied taxes on the financial industry to fund government takeovers. It outlawed mortgage practices that enticed consumers to take out loans that they could not afford or whose rates ballooned to excessive levels in the months and years following their purchase. It established limits on banks’ trading of derivatives. It regulated hedge funds and other private pools of capital. It created a consumer protection agency that placed curbs on excessive rates of interest charged by credit cards as well as consumer protections for other kinds of loans. It passed the House on December 11, 2009, without a single Republican vote. Pelosi stated, “We are sending a clear message to Wall Street: The party is over. Never again will reckless behavior on the part of a few threaten the fiscal stability of our people.” It took another 6 months to get similar legislation through the Senate with only a few Republican votes and then to Obama for his signature after a conference committee had developed a compromise between House and Senate versions. The final version was more conservative than the House version, and did not regulate the size of banks or even their reserve requirements. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 was nonetheless the most sweeping overhaul of the financial services industry since the 1930s. It was criticized from both the left and the right. Some liberals had wanted to nationalize large banks or place limits on their size. They wanted the legislation to cover car dealers who sold loans to purchase new cars, but this provision was eliminated from the legislation because of their lobbying. They wanted prohibitions of trading of derivatives by banks, but banking lobbyists scuttled this provision. Many conservatives contended that the legislation would curb banks’ profits excessively and place them at a disadvantage compared with less-regulated banks in some other nations. Consumers stood to gain from the creation of the Bureau of Financial Protection established by the banking legislation—an agency placed within the Federal Reserve Bank but completely independent of it. When fully staffed in a year, it would regulate market terms and pricing for financial products, as well as require that the complex fine print be eliminated in contracts that consumers signed. It would establish regulations over payday lenders, check cashers, and other nonbank financial services that have victimized many low-income and other consumers. It would require greater transparency by issuers of credit cards, such as stating their terms in words that consumers could understand. Obama eventually selected Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard professor who had urged the establishment of this Bureau many years earlier, to head it. Many experts believed, however, that the legislation would decrease the likelihood of another financial meltdown by curbing banks’ speculative excesses. A 10-member Financial Stability Oversight Council was created to monitor large financial institutions. The council’s job was to prevent banks from engaging in excessive speculation —and to conduct annual stress tests to be certain banks had sufficient assets to survive changes in the economy. The Great Recession Continues Despite modest gains, the economic recovery remained stalled in summer 2010. The national unemployment rate had barely dropped below 10% of workers, not counting the millions of discouraged job seekers. Sales of new homes had plunged to the lowest level on record in May—300,000 per month down from the 1 million sales a month earlier. Housing foreclosures ran about 90,000 per month, leaving about 12% of homeowners delinquent on their mortgages; some experts predicted the number of foreclosures would not abate during the next 3 years. * Robert Shiller, a noted housing economist, estimated that the nation had a 50% chance of a double-dip in housing in late July. * Due to excessive red tape, Obama’s policies proved unable to prevent foreclosures, helping only 350,000 homeowners to modify their mortgages under the Treasury Department’s program, compared with the goal of 3 million. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which insured about 96% of American mortgages, had been bailed out by the government to the tune of $145 billion; however, the CBO estimated an additional bailout of $250 billion would be required. Conservatives wanted to privatize these giant agencies, but Obama feared this policy would trigger another housing crash. As foreclosures spread in mid- and late 2010 from areas hit hardest earlier to other parts of the nation, such as Massachusetts, they were increasingly caused not by subprime mortgages, but by unemployment. With the downturn of housing construction, unemployment in the trades rose to 40% in some areas—and many of these workers had to foreclose on their homes —or neared foreclosure. Many housing experts accused the Obama administration of excessive timidity in preventing foreclosures because it merely gave homeowners temporary assistance to make their housing payments and urged banks to make only temporary modifications in mortgage terms. Many persons had to foreclose once this assistance ended. In states like Kansas that required mediators to work with banks and homeowners to prevent foreclosures— such as lowering interest payments—foreclosures dropped by 90%. (Legislation during the Great Depression had also required mandatory mediation with great success.) Homeowners often did not know who to contact in state or federal governments to help them avoid foreclosures— and often found banks, such as Bank of America, to not give them timely information or make modifications to their mortgages. * Commercial real estate also remained on the brink. Some experts feared it could collapse, taking with it scores of banks (like the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and the nearly 200 smaller and midsized banks that had failed in the prior 16 months). * Economic growth was delayed, as well, by the sharp decline in lending by smaller banks to small businesses, which is the major source of funds for businesses with fewer than 500 employees—firms that provide more than two-thirds of private-sector jobs. * Their lending had dropped by 40% from 2007 as banks cut loans to improve their balance sheets in the wake of defaults on their loans. When Obama sought to enact $30 billion of low-interest loans to these banks in summer 2010, he was greeted with near-unanimous Republican opposition. The American economy is vulnerable to economic developments in other nations in a global world due to fault lines in the international economy that include domestic political stresses, trade imbalances, and tensions when financial systems with different structures interact. * When the United States eased credit to help low- and moderate-income people purchase homes after 2000 and allowed banks to speculate on mortgage-backed securities, it set in motion a global recession—many foreign banks had purchased these securities. A banking crisis throughout much of Europe abated only when the European Union created its own version of TARP and conducted stress tests on European banks. Some economists believed that the stimulus bill was not as effective as some New Deal measures, such as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) that we discussed in Chapter 6 . * They wanted labor-intensive programs, such as putting unemployed youth and adults to work at nursing homes, child care centers, schools, sanitation departments, and conservation projects. The economy created new jobs each month in 2010, but it had to create about 400,000 jobs per month to make substantial cuts in unemployment. It created just 41,000 and 71,000 new jobs, respectively, in May and June 2010. It had to create more than 400,000 jobs per month not only to provide employment for unemployed workers, but for workers too discouraged even to look for jobs and for new entrants to the labor force. The Stimulus Plan had created many jobs according to the CBO in its report of May 25, 2010. It had increased the number of employed people by between 1.2 million and 2.8 million—and lowered the unemployment rate by 0.7 to 1.5 percentage points. * It had not made a decisive contribution to ending the Great Recession, however. Such economists as Charles Calomiris believed that far greater stimulus was needed, even if Obama would find it politically impossible to enact one. * The Education Debate Obama was determined to improve the nation’s schools: Despite the enactment in 2001 of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), students had lower scores on standardized math and English tests than many of their counterparts in Europe, Canada, and Asia. Obama devoted $80 billion of the stimulus bill to education; this was geared mostly to avoid laying off teachers during the recession. NCLB had set 2014 as the year when every child could read and do math at grade level, including persons of color, disabled students, and low-income students. Many states, too, had embraced the establishment of charter schools to give parents a choice of private schools, usually not-for-profit ones, that would establish their own curriculum and policies and whose teachers were not usually members of teacher unions. Obama and Arne Duncan, his secretary of education, proposed to replace No Child Left Behind with an initiative known as Race to the Top, which would give states producing plans that met goals established by the U.S. Department of Education grants from a pool of $4.3 billion. Obama and Duncan liked some features of NCLB, such as its requirement that schools give students math and English standardized tests periodically even if states had leeway to select the tests—and the use of data generated by these tests to determine if specific schools were improving math and English performance of their students and reducing disparities between minority and white students. They believed, however, that NCLB did not sufficiently focus on ways to measure and improve the performance of specific teachers; they believed that research had demonstrated that teacher performance trumped all other variables in determining students’ achievements in math and English. They eliminated the 2014 target for bringing every American child to proficiency on grounds that it was not realistic. * Why not, they asked, encourage states to compete for federal money by submitting plans to the U.S. Department of Education that met the following criteria? In addition to rating teachers’ performance, Race to the Top would identify schools that need to improve and target large amounts of new funds to them; this was in contrast to NCLB, which did not extend major economic assistance to failing schools. Rather, they usually languished with no additional support. * To everyone’s surprise, Race to the Top created more education reforms in secondary education in less than a year than had occurred under NCLB. More than three-fourths of states made changes in their education laws and procedures to be able to compete for its funds. States drafted plans that met its requirements by late 2010. Obama and Duncan decided to create even greater changes in states’ education policies, such as under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Instead of giving these funds to states based on set formulas, they conditioned much of them on states’ and schools’ showing that they had improved students’ educational outcomes and had changed how they evaluated teachers’ performance. If NCLB had focused on penalizing schools that failed to improve their students’ performance on standardized math and English tests, Race to the Top gave incentives to teachers to improve their work—as well as possible dismissal and cuts in their salaries if they failed to improve their performance. If NCLB assumed that schools would use traditional hiring processes, Race to the Top anticipated hiring teachers based on their innovativeness and teaching skills—such as had been used by the program The pay and retention of teachers must be linked to the test performance of their students—effectively terminating union contracts that gave teachers automatic tenure and pay increases. (1) States must place no ceiling on their number of charter schools.(2) States must use national tests rather than state-selected tests—and must develop sophisticated data systems to monitor students’ achievements and teachers’ performance. (3) Teachers’ performance may also be measured by the quality of their lesson plans and by other measures of their classroom skills. (4) Teach for America—rather than teachers who were merely credentialed in the usual ways. Obama and Duncan were convinced that Race to the Top would improve all schools, including those in low-income areas. They pointed to innovative charter schools in Harlem, where roughly 20% of students had selected charter schools that often greatly improved their educational performance. They contended that the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association had created too many roadblocks to dismissing ineffective teachers and establishing automatic pay increases. Some critics questioned Race to the Top. * They wondered if Race to the Top, like NCLB, placed the onus on student performance excessively on teachers, without also considering social, family, and economic factors that harm students’ performance. Roughly 30% of students migrate from their schools in low-income areas during a school year—making it difficult even to know which teacher to assess. Many students come to school hungry. Many children have been abused physically or verbally. Some students are homeless. Shouldn’t Race to the Top provide special services and resources to these schools, including social workers, rather than merely focusing on teachers’ skills in imparting knowledge? Isn’t reduction of class size particularly important in schools with low-income students since they often don’t come to school with the literacy levels of more affluent students? While Obama and Duncan pledged to divert funds to low-achieving schools, Race to the Top had only $4.3 billion to spend. Race to the Top also risked lowering teacher morale because it, like NCLB, put the blame on teachers for poor student performance rather than fully considering other factors, such as poverty (see Insert 12.1 ). Insert 12.1. Critical Analysis: How Can Learning Be Increased in Low-Income Schools? Use your knowledge of human behavior and the social environment to discuss how schools might better help one or more of the following groups to improve its performance: 1. Homeless children 2. Low-income children 3. Children subjected to family violence 4. Children with mental and learning disorders A new strategy for assessing teachers’ performance emerged in 2010 when a “value-added” approach to the evaluation of teachers emerged that assessed teachers’ performance as it contributed to higher scores of specific students on tests, as well as other outcome measures. Teachers with classes with disproportionate numbers of low achievers—who often came from low- income households—were less likely to be evaluated adversely than teachers with large numbers of high achievers under this system, because they would be evaluated positively if they improved the scores of their students. Nor was it clear if some schools would still be able to achieve education gains in the face of more teacher layoffs due to states’ fiscal deficits. Speaker of the House Pelosi convinced Obama to keep Congress in session in August 2010 to allocate $10 billion to states to preserve teaching jobs, but even these funds might prove insufficient. Other critics questioned about the effects of constant assessment on the morale and functioning of teachers—even talented ones. Others questioned whether standardized math and English tests measure important parts of student learning, such as creativity. Still others questioned if the American preoccupation with performance in math and English led to neglect of history, social studies, the arts, and physical education. Some critics wondered how the United States would cope with expected cuts in schools’ budgets during the prolonged recession. They noted that the Obama administration pumped $80 billion from the stimulus bill into public education to avoid the dismissal of tens of thousands of teachers during the Great Recession—the $4.3 billion targeted to Race to the Top was a pittance by comparison. With funds from the stimulus bill largely exhausted by late 2010, massive layoffs of public school teachers were inevitable despite Obama’s success in getting Congress to enact an additional $20 billion of subsidies to states beginning in September 2010. The recession’s reach also extended to other parts of the educational system. Community colleges found their funds depleted by large cuts from local and state governments. American students at all levels of the educational system were forced to find employment, making it less likely that they would receive degrees—unlike France, for example, with its larger student assistance and safety net programs. Americans had prided themselves on their high college graduation rate, but, in fact, American graduation rates had fallen “slightly below the average across all advanced economies.” * Obama pledged to increase graduation rates of junior colleges, as well as 4-year colleges—and proposed a $12 billion initiative over 5 years to allow 5 million students to graduate from community colleges by 2020. Deferred Reforms Obama had wanted to create new immigration, climate, and energy legislation during his first 2 years in office but had to defer them to his second 2 years because of the sheer amount of time it took to enact health, financial, and stimulus measures. Many Hispanics were angered that Obama had not yet tackled immigration reform. Many environmentalists were disappointed that Obama had not enacted major climate legislation that would tax industries with high levels of carbon emissions, pointing to growing evidence that climate changes could lead to flooding of low-lying areas within decades—possibly with seas rising by 3 or more feet within a century. The catastrophic oil spill of a deep-water well in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily owned by British Petroleum (BP), startled the nation and residents of the Gulf region when it began to spew millions of gallons of petroleum in spring 2010. This dealt a serious blow to the economy of the Gulf Coast since it took months to cap the well and then to seal it in a region that had already been devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Advocates of alternative fuels—such as those based on biomass, wind power, and solar power— hoped this disaster would spur legislation to encourage or require use of alternative fuels. Analyze Implications of the Republican Landslide in the Mid-T erm Elections of 2010 Polls showed that Obama and the Democrats had lost significant support from moderates and independents in early and mid-2010, primarily because unemployment remained near double digits. Republicans’ criticisms of the Stimulus Plan, TARP, and the rescuing of General Motors also took a toll on Democrats’ popularity—as did their allegations that health reform would prove overly costly. The Obama administration had failed to communicate the many positive outcomes of the Stimulus Plan, such as massive spending on roads and bridges, aid to the states, and significant tax cuts for many Americans. Voters often confused the Stimulus Plan with TARP. They did not realize that banks had repaid substantial amounts of TARP investments in them. Many persons, including some liberals, perceived the Obama administration as bailing out Wall Street rather than prosecuting officials who had broken laws. * Obama failed to receive much credit for his health care and financial reforms, either, since these measures would not be fully implemented for years to come, such as the insuring of 32 million Americans in 2014 or rolling out banking regulations in 2013 and beyond. Many Americans continued to suffer from unemployment and foreclosures, as well as erosion of their housing values and their investments. Obama realized that he had not communicated sufficiently with the public in the prior 2 years, partly because he had been forced to enact emergency measures such as bank regulations and the Stimulus Plan as well as the ACA in 2009 and spring 2010. Obama had promised in the campaign of 2008 that he would end gridlock between the two parties. When gridlock persisted and intensified during his first 2 years in office, many persons became disillusioned with his LO 12-6 leadership—often not realizing that he faced intractable opposition from Republicans who had plotted to make him a one-term president. Obama erred, as well, in failing to devote sufficient time to mobilizing his constituency for the 2010 elections. He failed to retain the volunteers and paid staff that had so brilliantly mobilized Democrats and swing voters in the 2008 presidential election. He did not sufficiently barnstorm the country. * The 2010 election results were disastrous for Democrats. Republicans defeated many Democratic candidates in districts that had voted Republican in elections prior to 2008. Considerable numbers of independents voted for Republican candidates. These discontents led many white blue-collar men and women to defect from Democratic candidates to Republican ones, particularly in the industrial heartland of the Midwest. Republicans made inroads in states that Obama had carried in 2008 such as Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, and Ohio. Republicans gained the votes of roughly 60% of white voters. Many Democrats stayed on the sidelines, including single women and persons in transition such as ones who had foreclosed on their homes. * If Democrats controlled the Senate with 51 seats (and two independents aligned with them) compared with 47 seats for Republicans, Republicans controlled the House with 242 seats compared with 193 seats for Democrats as Republican John Boehner replaced Democrat Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House. Democrats would face, moreover, a Republican Party that had moved markedly to the right as many Tea Party candidates defeated Republican moderates in Congress. Many Republicans predicted that they would defeat Obama and obtain control of both Houses of Congress in 2012, as well as defeat Obama in a clean sweep. The elections of 2012 would likely be influenced by the state of the economy, which retained double-digit unemployment in late 2010. Were these trends to persist, Democrats would lose the presidency and both Houses of Congress in 2012. * Republicans prevailed in 2012. They pledged to rescind banking regulations and the ACA by repealing them through legislation, refusing to fund them, or not implementing them. Republicans also ousted many Democratic governors in the election of 2010 in addition to gaining control of many state legislatures. These developments would have major repercussions in coming years because state governments reapportioned election districts in their states, including election districts for members of the House of Representatives. They refashioned these election districts to favor Republican candidates by drastically changing many of them to contain mostly Republican voters in so-called “gerrymandering.” This development virtually assured Republicans of retaining control of the House of Representatives in the presidential election of 2012 so that the House would be controlled not only by Republicans but relatively conservative ones, including many members of the Tea Party. The takeover of the House was a mixed blessing for Republicans. It gave them the power to defeat measures that they disliked, but it also linked them to the deeply conservative Tea Party that would likely oppose many reforms needed to generate electoral support for Republicans, such as immigration reform, climate reform, implementation of the ACA, and legislation to advance women’s rights. As we shall see, House Republicans shut down the government and almost led the nation to default on its fiscal obligations—developments that led to a backlash by many American against the Republican Party. Democrats possessed some advantages even in their dire situation. Republicans were favored by only 41% of voters in the aftermath of their electoral victories. Republicans had no clear leaders aside from Mitt Romney, who was defeated in the Republican primaries in 2008—and such conservatives as Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee. President Obama had the power of the veto. Elected members of the Tea Party were often so conservative that they were insensitive to the needs of vulnerable populations, including women, gays and lesbians, Latinos/as, and African Americans—groups that were likely to support Democrats in 2012. Tea Party members and Republicans risked being seen as naysayers because they offered few proposals of their own as they concentrated on attacking the ACA and bank regulations. Another Hidden Stimulus Plan With the election over, both parties had to decide what to do with George W. Bush’s large tax cuts (see Chapter 11 ) set to expire on January 1, 2011. A compromise was possible in this instance. If Republicans wanted them not to expire for middle-class or wealthy persons, Democrats wanted a variety of social programs not to expire that had been devised to meet the needs of persons ravaged by the Great Recession. In return for allowing Bush’s tax cuts to remain in place, Obama obtained their support for extending unemployment insurance of unemployed persons to 99 weeks for the next 13 months, adjusting the alternative minimum tax for 2 years to lessen its impact on middle-income families, adding a 1-year payroll tax cut for American workers who earned up to $106,800, extending a $1,000 tax cut for children for 2 years, cutting taxes on businesses by allowing them to immediately expense all business investments in 2011, and giving tax concessions to many Americans by repealing the temporary limit on itemized tax deductions and the phasing out of their personal exemptions. Republicans also obtained a provision to provide a $5 million tax exemption for estates, as well as taxes of 35% on the remaining portion of estates—provisions that benefited high-income families. * When news of this proposed legislative package became known, liberal Democrats in the House threatened to vote against it on grounds it gave too many concessions to affluent Americans and would greatly add to the national debt. They appeared ready to accept the package, however, when Obama—and former president Bill Clinton—accused them of not buying into a proposal would provide $858 billion of stimulus to the economy spread over several years—or roughly the same amount as the Stimulus Plan itself. (Just the extension of Bush’s tax cuts for middle-class families increased their income by roughly $3,000.) The Congress enacted this Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2010 in mid- December. This hidden stimulus measure was augmented, moreover, by the decision by Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve Board, to engage in “qualitative easing” by having the Federal Reserve Board purchase almost $1 trillion in long-term treasury bonds to lower interest rates on bonds to free up private resources for investments in the nation’s economy. When the Middle Class Tax Relief legislation of 2010 is coupled with Bernanke’s measures, the government prepared to place almost $2 trillion into the American economy in 2011 and 2012—“ hidden” stimulus resources that may have prevented a double-dip recession. Understand How the Soaring National Debt and Annual Budget Deﬁcits Led to Budget Battles in 201 1 and 2013 Recall budget battles that we discussed in the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. Barack Obama’s presidency would be subsumed by budget controversies from late 2010 onward that would absorb almost the entire energy of congressional leaders and Obama’s administration to the detriment of achieving many other policy goals . These battles would be battles for three basic reasons. First, the nation had developed a massive federal debt of $13.8 trillion—or over 90% of GDP in late 2010 that was caused by many successive years of huge annual budget deficits in the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Bush’s deficits derived from his massive tax cuts and vastly increased military spending. Obama’s were caused by the huge decline in federal revenues from the Great Recession, large military spending from two wars, large social spending from unemployment and other programs for citizens harmed by the Great Recession, the nearly $1 trillion for the Stimulus Plan that possibly foreclosed a double-dip recession, TARP, and payments to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Had these adverse events not occurred, federal deficits would have hardly existed from 2009 through 2019 so the large deficits cannot rightly be blamed on Obama as some Republicans suggest. * Debts of this magnitude, if unchecked, can have serious economic consequences. They are financed by selling bonds to wealthy individuals as well as to banks around the world—but these bonds must be funded through interest payments to their purchases. These interest payments required substantial payments from the federal budget that depleted resources for other portions of the budget. Many economists worried, too, that the sale of trillions of dollars of federal bonds would divert funds from private investments needed for economic growth. LO 12-7 Second, huge annual budget deficits created this huge debt because the national debt is the size of budget deficits over time minus budget surpluses. Recall that President Bill Clinton had staunched the growth of the national debt in the last 2 years of his presidency by running annual budget surpluses —but not the debt itself which can only be retired if the government pays off all the bonds that are used to finance the debt. Clinton’s budget surpluses disappeared and were replaced by large annual budget deficits during the presidency of George W. Bush—leading to renewed and explosive growth of the nation’s debt. This trend continued during President Obama’s first term in office as revenues from the federal income tax plummeted with the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009 and beyond—and as government expenses rose as is customary during recessions and depressions. Third, the mounting size of annual deficits and the national debt occurred just as controversy over American national priorities greatly increased between liberals and conservatives. Liberals knew that economic inequality had increased markedly in the United States since the late 1970s as the wealthiest 1% of the United States came to hold a huge share of the nation’s wealth. The tax cuts of George W. Bush had accelerated this trend toward great inequality because they disproportionately enriched this wealthy elite. The actions of large banks in causing the Great Recession further maddened many liberals, particularly when they received massive subsidies from TARP. Many liberals, too, were uneasy about the sheer growth of military spending in the United States between 1999 and 2010—funding that competed with domestic discretionary spending. Many of them had opposed the war in Iraq, particularly when they realized that President George W. Bush had initiated conflict in Iraq on the false premise that it had weapons of mass destruction. Many conservatives were convinced, by contrast, that runaway social spending on entitlements like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, as well as discretionary domestic spending, primarily caused the growth of annual budget deficits and the national debt. Many of them had come to demonize President Obama as a quasi-socialist president—conveniently ignoring the role of the Great Recession, President George W. Bush’s tax cuts, as well as two unfunded wars that he did not start, in causing annual deficits and the national debt to grow markedly during his presidency. Liberals and conservatives held two different budget narratives. Both of them realized that the growth of annual deficits and the national debt were unsustainable, but they had very different remedies. Following Obama’s lead, Democrats wanted a “balanced approach” to cutting federal deficits. They wanted to curtail Bush’s tax cuts for affluent Americans and cut tax loopholes used by them. They wanted some cuts in domestic discretionary spending and entitlements, but not massive ones. They wanted some cuts in military spending as the Iraq War wound down. Augmented by tea party victors in the congressional elections of 2010, conservatives increasingly opposed any significant increases in taxes or cuts in military spending, forcing them to rely only on cuts in domestic spending. They hewed to the supply-side economic philosophy of President Ronald Reagan that favored low tax rates for everyone, but particularly for affluent Americans who would, they argued, increase economic growth through their investments. Unlike Reagan who made no major cuts in entitlements, they wanted to cut all entitlements markedly. They favored replacing Medicare with medical savings accounts to be used by seniors to purchase their care—but with accounts so small that many seniors would have to dig deep into their own pockets to fund their medical care. They wanted to turn Medicaid over to the states while greatly reducing federal contributions to it. They favored deep cuts in Food Stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit, as well as cutting even the relatively low federal contributions to TANF. The stage was set by late 2010, then, for a series of titanic budget battles. Conservatives were determined to use their limited power to create a series of budget crises by using adversarial tactics, such as not increasing the national debt ceiling in a timely way. * Democrats viewed many Republicans as unreasonable in their desire to keep Bush’s tax cuts for affluent Americans and to resort exclusively to mean-minded cuts in domestic programs. Members of both parties were deterred from agreeing to budget compromises because they believed they could defeat the other party decisively in the presidential and congressional elections of 2012, allowing them to impose their priorities on the other party. Both sides were ill disposed, then, to develop a grand compromise that included taxes, entitlements, military spending, and domestic discretionary spending. Leaders of neither party, then, endorsed the findings of a bipartisan presidential deficit-and-debt commission, established by President Obama and chaired by Republican Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles, that offered such a grand compromise in December 2010. Most Democrats, including President Obama, opposed its recommended entitlement reforms and its spending cuts. Most Republicans opposed its recommended tax increases led by the militant anti-tax advocate, Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, who had pressured many of them to make an anti-tax-increase pledge. * The budget impasse was manifest in four budget battles in 2011, 2012, and 2013. The battle lines were drawn in early 2011 as everyone realized that the United States would soon hit its official debt ceiling of $14.3 trillion. Were Congress not to raise the ceiling, the United States could default (i.e., not pay its bills and creditors) even as Timothy Geithner, the treasury secretary, predicted “a default would inflict catastrophic, far-reaching damage on our nation’s economy, significantly reducing growth and increasing unemployment.” * Republicans hoped to force Democrats to accede to their demands for spending cuts, entitlement reforms, and not raising taxes in exchange for receiving their support for raising the debt ceiling. Republican Paul Ryan proposed ending Medicare. He wanted to give seniors a choice of private plans but with a ceiling on federal contributions that would no longer rise with the rate of medical inflation—a policy that would greatly increase seniors’ health costs over time. House Republicans proposed the deepest spending cuts in generations—$60 billion in cuts in February that included a 30% cut in the Environmental Protection Agency, elimination of support for Planned Parenthood, and defunding of implementation of the ACA. * President Obama offered his balanced approach. He noted that the Obama administration had already made almost $1 trillion in cuts to Medicare spending by reducing fees to providers when the ACA was enacted. His annual budget, released in February, instituted a freeze on domestic spending while increasing spending on education, infrastructure repairs, and technology to enhance economic growth. He proposed his own balanced budget in April 2011 pledging to cut the federal deficit by $4 trillion over 12 years—or roughly comparable to Republican Paul Ryan’s plan. Unlike Ryan, however, Obama proposed significant increases in taxes on wealthy Americans—revenue that allowed him to increase spending on education, infrastructure, and technology while retaining Medicare’s benefits. He charged Republicans with giving “people like me a $200,000 tax cut that’s paid for by asking 33 seniors to each pay $6,000 more in health costs.” * President Obama contended in May 2011 that the Republicans’ vision “is less about reducing the deficit than it is about changing the basic social compact in America.” * This budget battle temporarily eased because the Department of Treasury was able to extend the debt ceiling temporarily with technical measures. Intense negotiations between Vice President Biden and Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate Majority leader, led to passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011 in August. The legislation cut discretionary spending by $1.2 trillion—and capped it each year for the next decade. It established a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction—the “Super Committee”—with six members from each party to issue a report by November 23, 2011, to reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years. It required each House to consider these recommendations by December 23, 2011. It required each chamber to consider balanced budget amendments to the Constitution. It allowed the president to greatly increase the debt limit if these cuts were enacted. To put additional pressure on the Select Committee and on Congress to reach a grand budget compromise, both Republicans and Democrats agreed to an unusual back-up procedure known as sequestration . Congress would be required to accept cuts of $1.2 trillion over 10 years if the Super Committee and Congress failed to achieve these cuts on their own—cuts that would be automatically achieved through across-the-board cuts of budgets of virtually all domestic agencies, as well as the defense department over a period of 10 years. Roughly $86 billion in these cuts would begin in spring 2013. (Democrats were able to limit any cuts in Medicare benefits to 2% and to exempt Medicaid, Social Security, and civilian employee pay from these cuts.) It was widely assumed that both Democrats and Republicans would make the necessary cuts on their own because they would find sequestration to be unacceptable. If Democrats would not want these automatic across-the-board cuts in domestic programs, Republicans would not want them in military spending. Ominously, however, Obama and House Speaker John Boehner were unable to negotiate a budget deal to achieve the $1.8 trillion in cuts behind closed doors in August—and the Super Committee soon dissolved due to partisan bickering. It appeared that sequestration could begin by January 2, 2013, even as many economists warned that automatic cuts of sequestration, when coupled with the end of a payroll tax holiday and emergency unemployment benefits for millions of long-term unemployed persons, could harm the fragile economic recovery. The presidential, congressional, and local political campaigns of 2012 intervened before more budget crises could occur as leaders of both parties were hopeful that their budget priorities would prevail if they were victorious. Analyze Obama’s Landslide Reelection in 2012 The political campaign of 2012 was the most consequential election since 1932 because it pitted President Obama, who believed “we’re all in this together,” with Mitt Romney, who wanted to cut taxes, diminish government, and increase the resources of the wealthiest Americans. * Had Romney won, he would have been pressured by House Republicans and members of his party to hew to conservative positions, to repeal health reform, to cut taxes even on affluent Americans, and to cut social programs. Reelection would allow Obama, by contrast, to keep the American welfare state mostly intact while resisting efforts to cut taxes even further on affluent Americans. The presidential campaign of 2012 began with Republican primaries that pitted former Governor Mitt Romney against such candidates as former Congressman Newt Gingrich, former Senator Rick Santorum, Texas Governor Rick Perry, Libertarian Congressman Ron Paul, Herman Cain, Representative Michele Bachmann, and others. The candidates appealed to their party’s base, including Tea Party members, by mostly supporting harsh measures toward immigrants, deep cuts in entitlements, opposition to gay marriage, opposition to any tax increases, and pro-life positions. The battle between Republicans during the debates that accompanied the primary battles between them in specific states greatly harmed both Romney and the Republican Party. These candidates frequently attacked Romney, often portraying him as too moderate and as someone who kept changing positions. They noted that his health reforms as governor of Massachusetts were remarkably similar to the ACA which Republicans wanted to repeal. By often criticizing Romney for moderate positions he had taken in the past with respect to health care, abortion, and other issues, the other Republican contenders forced him farther to the right, making it LO 12-8 harder for him to appeal to undecided, independent, and moderate voters in the general election. Convinced that Romney would win the nomination of the Republican Party, Democratic strategists decided to launch a massive advertising campaign against him in the summer and early fall. They used a populist approach. They portrayed him as a rich man who did not understand the needs of middle-class persons. They criticized him for failing to release his tax records. They accused him of causing the unemployment of many Americans when he oversaw the purchase and sale of companies when he headed Bain Capital, a firm that purchased corporations and operated them —but that often added to their debt sufficiently that they eventually became bankrupt. They attacked his failure to support bailouts of General Motors and efforts to help Chrysler. They accused him of changing positions on key issues during his political career. These negative advertisements eroded Romney’s popularity in the polls and placed him on the defensive. Statements of Republican contenders during the primary battles harmed the image of the Republican Party, as well. Governor Rick Perry of Texas could not remember the names of the three federal departments he proposed to abolish during a televised debate between Republican contenders. Newt Gringrich wanted to start a large colony on the moon. Rick Santorum sided with right-to-lifers and the many restrictions they placed on choice by women. Michelle Bachman withdrew from the race when few persons voted for a leader of the Tea Party. Romney finally secured sufficient electoral votes to become the Republican presidential contender and was officially nominated on August 28, 2012. He was a formidable candidate. He had achieved great wealth, estimated at more than $200 million, as the founder and partner of Bain Capital. He had successfully managed the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. He had been a one-term governor of Massachusetts, where he had successfully balanced its budget. He was a devout Mormon who believed strongly that private philanthropy should be used extensively to address poverty and other social ills. Romney also had many liabilities when facing Barack Obama within his own party and in the nation. We have already discussed how many conservatives believed he was too moderate, had flip-flopped on many issues, and had favored universal health insurance in Massachusetts. Some arch conservatives were disappointed with his favoring of abortion rights when he was governor, but particularly his enactment of universal health insurance in Massachusetts—a plan that became the model for Obama’s ACA that many conservative Republicans had vowed to repeal or not fund if they gained control of Congress. Romney refused to make his tax returns public unlike most presidential contenders, raising suspicions that he did not pay sufficient taxes. (He divulged late in the campaign that he paid taxes at an average of 14% per year on annual income exceeding $20 million.) Romney’s biggest liability, however, was the Republican Party. Rather than expanding its base and its leadership to reflect the growing diversity of the United States, it had retained a largely white membership and leadership. Its leaders, such as Governor Jan Brewer of Arizona, took anti-immigration positions to the dislike of many Latino/a voters. Its congressional leaders and senatorial candidates opposed abortion rights such as senatorial candidate Todd Aiken of Missouri, who opposed legal abortions for rape on grounds that “if it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” Its leaders often seemed more interested in protecting affluent Americans than helping low- or middle-income Americans, as well as Wall Street banks. Its nominating convention was mostly attended by white Americans with far fewer persons of color than the Democratic Convention. It culminated in nominating speeches by Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, who hardly mentioned Romney’s name, as well as an ineffective speech by movie star Clint Eastwood. The Democratic Convention was highlighted, by contrast, by an impassioned speech by Bill Clinton, who argued that Republican’s budget policies would cut safety-net programs excessively and increase budget deficits by failing to raise taxes on affluent Americans. President Obama had liabilities of his own. High unemployment was his greatest liability since, aside from Franklin Roosevelt in 1936 and 1940, no sitting president has won reelection with such high unemployment. He had managed to increase employment each year in this first term but only incrementally—and vast numbers of young persons, Latinos/as, African Americans, blue-collar voters, and others remained unemployed. Recent graduates of college often could not find work. Many persons who had hoped to retire had to seek employment to make ends meet. Millions of Americans had foreclosed on their houses or were “under water” when their mortgage exceeded the actual value of their homes—often because they had been misled by banks and mortgage lenders about the true value of their homes and the likelihood that they could make mortgage payments. These harsh realities meant that Obama was often not viewed as the transformative leader who had led many voters to support him in the presidential campaign of 2008. Rather than ending gridlock, as he had promised, Congress was a battleground between the two parties and between liberals and conservatives. His success in enacting the ACA and Dodd-Frank banking regulations, as well as the Stimulus Plan, led many Republicans and some moderates to view him as excessively liberal. Yet Obama had many advantages. As the sitting president, he did not have to endure grueling primary battles like the Republican contenders. He was an effective campaigner. He eloquently defended Democrats’ core values, such as their commitment to policies that would assist the middle class. He defended government by noting how every American depended on its various programs. He attacked the marked inequality of the United States even as his critics wanted him to discuss ways to help impoverished persons more assertively. He was able to raise huge amounts of money through personal appeals. Polls indicated that most Americans liked him on a personal level. He had achieved major policy successes in his first term. He could document that he had made initial progress in righting the economy. He could claim success in rescuing Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler. His success in planning a military operation that killed Osama Bin Laden, as well as his success in killing many other leaders of Al Qaeda, allowed him to escape Republicans’ attacks on his foreign policy during most of the campaign. Most Americans supported his decision to end the Iraq War and to remove most American troops from Afghanistan by 2014. Understanding Obama’s Use of Electoral Community Organization It was apparent in early September that the presidential contest would be closely fought. Both parties and their allies formed organizations to raise hundreds of millions of dollars—on top of funds raised by the candidates— and eventually more than $1 billion. Polls soon suggested that the race would be decided in a relatively small number of battleground states that included Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Colorado, Nevada, Virginia, and Florida. Many experts attribute Obama’s victory in 2012 to his use of technology, volunteers, and paid local staff to develop a sophisticated “ground game.” He had prevailed in the presidential election of 2008 partly because of his use of volunteers and paid staff in many congressional districts but greatly enhanced this strategy in 2011 and 2012. He established his campaign headquarters in Chicago in 2011 for the election of 2012 where he placed David Plouffe and Jim Messina in charge. They developed a huge field organization. They began hiring large numbers of analytic and technical staff versed in sophisticated approaches for “microtargeting” potential voters—and developed a highly classified place in the campaign headquarters known as “the cave.” These technical staff developed a centralized database that linked the volunteers and paid workers in specific congressional districts with themselves. These technical staff and Obama made a strategic decision: they would focus their efforts on identifying key voters who had the potential to allow Obama to win the election. They were determined to identify those voters who had not already decided to support Obama or Romney since they would waste their campaign resources on these voters. Rather, they wanted to focus on the following groups: voters in key congressional districts in the 8 to 10 battleground states whose voters were split between the two parties but that could give them electoral votes sufficient to swing the election to Obama. Even in these congressional districts, they wanted to identify voters with the following profile: They had not yet made a final decision about who they would support, but they could be persuaded to support Obama and Democrats rather than Romney and Republicans. Once they had identified these voters, they would then reach them through personal contacts with volunteers and paid professionals in specific congressional districts with split allegiances between the two parties. They used sophisticated technology to identify these voters. They identified almost 100 variables that, when taken together, identified voters who might swing toward Obama, including questions about their prior voting behaviors, the voting preferences of their spouses, their volunteer activities in the community, and their voting behaviors in school board contests in their communities. They coupled this “support scale” with a “persuasion scale” that predicted whether volunteers and paid staff could persuade them to shift to support for Obama. Once they had identified voters who could swing to Obama on both scales, they divulged their identities to Democratic volunteers and paid staff in prioritized congressional districts in battleground states. These volunteers and paid staff made personal calls on these voters to elicit their support before the elections and on election day. They targeted robo-calls from Bill Clinton and other Democratic leaders to these voters. They funded advertisements on the mass media in those congressional districts that they knew would reach these voters. These Democratic electoral strategies were particularly effective because Republicans lacked the technical staff, volunteers, and paid campaign aides to counter them. The Obama campaign headquarters also made extensive use of social media, such as Facebook, to find and persuade swing voters in a strategy called “targeted sharing.” If an Obama supporter had 1,000 Facebook friends, for example, they determined how many of them already supported Obama and focused, instead, on ones deemed to be swing voters who could be persuaded to vote for Obama. They focused on, say, the 6 to 10 Facebook friends of this supporter who had the potential to swing to Obama. Once they had identified them, they asked the Obama Facebook supporter to send messages to their designated Facebook friends—who might also be contacted by campaign volunteers and paid staff. This became a potent campaign strategy because of the sheer number of Facebook users in the United States. The Obama campaign devised other clever tactics. They raised $75 million, for example, by establishing “Quick Donate” on mobile phones. They used “Dashboard” to allow people to tap into “Call Tool” that let volunteers join specific groups like Nurses for Obama. * These technical models were supplemented by targeting members of demographic groups known to favor Democrats and to have voted for Obama in 2008 in large numbers— including African Americans, Latinos/as, Asian Americans, young voters, and women. They obtained the support, for example, of Oprah Winfrey, who encouraged women and African Americans to vote for Obama, as well as Cristina Saralegui, often called the “Latina Oprah!” * They mounted effective campaigns on college campuses. Romney made mistakes that later haunted him even before the campaign began. We have discussed how he opposed bailing out General Motors and offering assistance to Chrysler in 2009 in contrast to President Obama— decisions that would come to haunt him in the presidential campaign of 2012 in battleground states of Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania when Obama would remind blue-collar and other voters that he had helped keep these companies from becoming insolvent. As these companies survived and mostly repaid their loans, Obama successfully sought the support of tens of thousands of automobile workers. In another mistake, Romney told a roomful of affluent supporters in May 2012 that: “47 percent of the people will vote for (Obama) no matter what … who are dependent upon government, who believe they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it … these are people who pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn’t connect.” * Unbeknown to Romney, someone videotaped his remarks and placed them on YouTube, remarks discovered months later by Jason Carter, the grandson of former president Jimmy Carter, who divulged them to Corn, who published them in Mother Jones . Romney later admitted that these remarks were a devastating blow to his campaign. Already viewed as unsympathetic to ordinary people, they suggested that he viewed anyone who used programs widely needed by many Americans to survive harsh economic realities as lazy persons who are dependent on government programs—and who support Obama only because he gives them government benefits. Critics promptly noted that many working Americans have such low wages that they do pay federal income taxes but pay payroll taxes and sales taxes in amounts that usually exceeded Romney’s federal tax rate of 14%. Many other Americans do not pay federal taxes because they are retired—and that many disabled veterans and unemployed persons do not pay income taxes because they cannot work. Romney compounded his unfortunate comments by saying, “My job is not to worry about those people.” (He later said that he had misspoke but even later attributed the Democrats’ and Obama’s victory to “gifts” by Obama and the Democrats to poor people, college students, and others, including Food Stamps and college scholarships.) Romney hurt his chances, as well, by frequently changing positions during the campaign. He had run to the far right during Republican primaries to defeat arch conservatives like Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, but soon realized these positions had antagonized many moderates and independents. When he moved to the middle by (now) extolling the Massachusetts health care plan, supporting funding of education and grants to help persons go to college, and not giving affluent persons tax cuts, he antagonized some conservatives and led some voters to conclude he would say anything to win. Obama hurt himself when he delivered a lackluster performance in the first of his three televised debates with Romney because he received poor advice from his campaign staff to play it safe. But he (at least) held his own in the succeeding debates ( Figure 12.3 ). Figure 12.3. Marc Serota/Getty Images Presidential debate between Obama and Romney. Obama was helped by assistance from other public figures. He benefited from the decision by Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey to reach out to him, rather than to Romney, as he received federal disaster relief for Hurricane Sandy that devastated portions of his state and New York City. He benefited from an endorsement from Michael Blumberg, the independent mayor of New York City. He was endorsed by former general Colin Powell. Republicans were harmed in many states, as well, by their attempts to suppress voting. A huge increase in early voting through mailed ballots had taken place between 1998 and 2010 that coincided with a large increase in voter turnout—a development that helped Democrats. After winning many governorships in 2010, Republicans launched “the most systematic and pervasive effort to discourage voting in almost a century” in 19 states that included Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Virginia, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire. * They variously required voters to obtain photo IDs, curtail voter registration drives, cut back on early in-person voting, ended election-day registration, and increased challenges of voters’ citizenship. These tactics led to long lines at many voting sites that included disproportionate numbers of Democratic voters, low-income persons, and members of racial minorities. These tactics backfired because they increased turnout of the very groups they targeted. Many pollsters contended from mid-September onward that the race was too close to call, but one pollster, Nate Silver, consistently predicted that Obama would win by using sophisticated predictive models. * Obama won virtually all of the battleground states by using his campaign operation to turn out considerable numbers of voters from specific groups where substantial majorities supported him. He obtained the support of 55% of women, 93% of African Americans, 71% of Latinos/as, 73% of Asian Americans, 56% of moderates, and 60% of voters under the age of 30. Large numbers of blue-collar voters in Ohio and Michigan supported Obama. Members of the LGBT community overwhelmingly voted for him. Many pundits contended that Obama had created a Democratic coalition equivalent to the one created by President Franklin Roosevelt more than 75 years earlier. It not only swept Obama to victory and retained Democrats’ control of the Senate, but confined Republicans to states of the confederacy during the Civil War and assorted Midwestern and Western states. The Republican constituency was overwhelmingly Caucasian and male—and included 56% of voters over the age of 65. The election was a major victory for Democrats, who retained the presidency, widened their margin in the Senate, and gained eight seats in the House even if they did not reclaim it. (They obtained many more total votes in House races than Republicans, but could not prevail in many congressional elections because Republican governors and legislatures had gerrymandered election districts to favor Republicans.) Obama, like President Franklin Roosevelt decades earlier, created a new Democratic Coalition composed of Latinos/as, women, African Americans, intellectuals, youth, moderates, independent voters, the LGBTQ population, and Asian Americans—and even blue-collar voters in some industrial states. Republicans retained the allegiance of white voters, elderly persons, and white males. As important, Obama won most swing states, leaving Republicans only with victories in most Southern states (with the exceptions of Florida and Virginia); Western states of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and Arizona; middle Western states of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana, and Missouri; and West Virginia. It was a landslide victory: Obama received 332 votes in the electoral college as compared with 206 for Romney—and would have won the election even had he lost Ohio and Florida. * Many Republicans, as well as political experts, believed the Republican Party was doomed to minority status if it did not develop greater rapport with members of the demographic groups that overwhelmingly support Democrats in 2012. The mood was gloomy at a Republican Retreat in mid- January as an array of strategists, conservative intellectuals, and CEOs discussed how the Republican Party might remake its image so that most voters do not believe that “the Party’s economic agenda helps nobody except rich people and big business.” * Gridlock would remain unabated in the first year of Obama’s second term. Many Republicans feared moving toward the middle because a conservative Republican might oppose and defeat them in a Republican primary—as had happened to such Republican stalwarts as Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana. Fearing this prospect, other moderate Republicans had retired from office, such as Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine. House Speaker John Boehner, unable to convince his fellow House Republicans to support a budget compromise that had emerged from secret negotiations between himself and President Obama, withdrew from these negotiations setting the stage for further budget confrontations in 2012 and beyond. More Budget Battles We will not discuss in great detail the budget battles of 2012 and 2013 because they involved the same partisan conflict and the same issues that surfaced in the budget battles of 2011 that we have already discussed. Obama believed Republicans should accept his “balanced approach” that favored tax increases on affluent Americans and selected spending cuts, as compared only to spending cuts, since he had campaigned on this issue and had won a major victory. Polls indicated, moreover, that a large majority of Americans favored his approach. He soon discovered, however, that Republicans still favored (only) cuts in domestic spending, as well as reductions of taxes of affluent Americans—even though these spending cuts when coupled with lost revenues from their proposed tax cuts could not supply sufficient revenues to cut annual deficits. The first budget battle took place soon after Obama’s reelection in 2012. Recall that President George W. Bush’s huge tax cuts for affluent and middle-class Americans were set to expire on January 1, 2013, when almost all income earners would suddenly have significantly higher taxes. President Obama had stated his position on Bush’s tax cuts many times during his victorious presidential campaign: Keep Bush’s tax cuts for couples earning less than $250,000 but terminate ones for families earning more than this amount. Republican leaders made it clear they did not want any of Bush’s tax cuts to expire. They knew they had to negotiate with the Democrats, however, so that they would not be blamed for tax increases for families earning less than $250,000. Obama and congressional Republicans finally agreed to negotiate, however, because Democrats threatened to let all the tax cuts expire—finally agreeing to let them expire for families with income that exceeded $400,000. Some Democrats were furious that Obama even gave them this concession, wanting the revenues from all families earning more than $250,000. Sequestration began on March 1. It set in place automatic cuts primarily in discretionary spending of roughly $1 trillion through 2023 with about $85 billion in the current year spread between military spending and domestic spending. * (Recall that Medicare and Medicaid were mostly shielded from sequestration cuts.) We should note that, even with gridlock, Democrats and Republicans had made considerable headway in cutting annual budget deficits and slowing the rise of the federal debt. They had cut projected deficits over 10 years by $4 trillion from spending cuts of $1.5 trillion, increased tax revenues, $1 trillion from sequestration cuts, and $700 billion from decreased interest payments on a diminished national debt. * Deficits were further cut by rising tax revenues as the nation’s economy gradually improved. Several nagging questions remained. Many of these cuts took place in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession when unemployment remained stubbornly high due to low economic growth. Many economists worried that the United States was wrongly taking the route of Great Britain where spending cuts had triggered a double-dip recession that created a horrible toll on its citizens. Would it not have been better, they asked, to delay cuts for several years? Many liberals, governors, and Obama were worried about the combined projected domestic cuts from sequestration over 10 years. Just after sequestration began and having finally made progress on reducing its own deficits and achieving modest economic growth after the Great Recession, California stood to lose $9 billion in federal spending in the first year of sequestration. * The states’ 64,000 civilian military employees would be furloughed, resulting in $400 million in gross pay along with a loss of $3.2 billion in military spending. Education and social programs, already severely cut during the Great Recession, would have to absorb almost $6 billion in cuts, including a 5% cut in research projects of the University of California and $88 million in federal aid for primary and secondary education. Student aid for college students would be cut substantially in the succeeding year. Reductions would continue for 9 additional years if Congress failed to make cuts needed to end sequestration. Some social programs were particularly devastated by sequestration. Between 575,000 and 750,000 pregnant women and children at nutritional risk were turned away from the WIC program by the end of fiscal year 2013 due to sequestration. * Head Start, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the Social Services Block Grant, and Title IV-B part 1 of Child Welfare Services suffered substantial cuts from sequestration, such as the ending of 70,000 slots for Head Start children in its first year. * Bear in mind that domestic discretionary spending was hardly a runaway item in the federal budget before sequestration, these relatively meager resources funded block grants, child care, federal payments to states for education, federal funds for student aid, medical research, food and water safety, law enforcement, and many other programs. If the Budget Control Act of 2011 cut discretionary spending by 8% in 2013 rising to 13% in 2021, sequestration would add another 6% to 8% cut in 2013 and each succeeding year to 2021—for a total of 14% cuts in 2013 rising to 19% in 2021. Why not, some liberal economists asked, use tax increases on relatively wealthy Americans as a tool for reducing budget deficits rather than cutting programs used disproportionately by members of vulnerable populations? By the reckoning of Richard Kogan of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, only $1.5 trillion in additional savings was needed to reduce the federal debt to 73% of GDP in the period 2014–2023. * Much or all of these additional savings could come from tax loopholes that disproportionately favor affluent persons, including about $850 billion for individuals and about $200 billion for corporations. As one example, an investment banker who earns $675,000 and has a $1 million mortgage with an annual mortgage-interest payment of $40,000 per year receives a housing subsidy of $14,000 annually by writing off his interest payments on his taxes—as compared with a social worker making $60,000, paying $10,000 each year in mortgage interest, who receives a housing subsidy of only $1,500 per year. * Scores of other tax loopholes exist—with 26% of their benefits received by the top 1% of income and 66% by the top 20%. * Budget battles culminated in October 2013 despite the progress the nation had made in reducing its budget deficits and was precipitated by two developments: the failure of Congress to enact a budget that would cover its expenses and the failure of Congress to raise the limit on the federal debt. If Congress does not enact a budget and fails to enact temporary provisions in a so-called continuing resolution, it cannot fund its programs, so a government shutdown results—as happened in the presidency of Bill Clinton in 1995. This came to pass in October 2013 when the government shut down many federal facilities and museums, delayed or stopped payments to veterans, and furloughed thousands of public employees when Congress failed to enact a continuing resolution. This government shutdown was caused, President Obama contended, by Republicans because the House of Representatives, controlled by them, failed to enact a budget. As the shutdown continued, a public outcry took place about the apparent incompetence of federal politicians—with a disproportionate share of it directed toward House Republicans, including Speaker John Boehner. An even more ominous date approached when the federal debt ceiling would soon be breeched. World leaders warned that American credibility would be severely harmed if the United States defaulted on its fiscal obligations and commitments, much as when persons who become bankrupt cannot honor their debts. Economists warned that Social Security checks might not be issued or would be delayed—and that many social programs would receive no further funding. President Obama contended that these budget debacles resulted primarily from Republicans’ efforts to de-fund the ACA, which they had labeled as “Obama Care.” This allegation rang true because the House leadership hinged negotiations on the condition that Obama agree to negotiate changes in the ACA, such as delaying its inception for a year. While Obama had compromised with Republicans on prior budget talks, he insisted that he would not negotiate on the ACA as he contended that Republicans wrongly held the ACA “ransom”—a law that had been constitutionally enacted by both chambers of the Congress, declared constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, and approved by voters when they had reelected him to the presidency in 2012. If Republicans wanted to cut or terminate the ACA, he argued that they should win elections so that they possessed sufficient votes to achieve these aims. As public opinion polls emerged that demonstrated that most Americans sided with Obama, Republican leadership backed off and accepted a bipartisan compromise developed in the Senate to end the shut down by refunding the government and to raise the debt ceiling. This grand compromise would last only into January 2014, setting the stage for a new round of budget battles. Everyone agreed that the ACA would be “off the table,” but the battles over national priorities would be front and center. If Congress and the president could not agree, as in prior years, on the correct balance of tax increases and spending cuts, the voters might ultimately decide who would prevail in the congressional elections of 2014, as well as the presidential election of 2016. Describe Obama’ s Policy Agenda for 2013 Obama made clear in his State of the Union address in February 2013 that he would prioritize five issues: comprehensive immigration reform, gun control, enacting policies to slow climate change, economic growth, and implementing the Affordable Care Act. Immigration reform. Immigration reform became enmeshed in partisan conflict during President Obama’s second term after Congress and President George W. Bush had almost enacted it in late 2016. We discuss subsequently in this chapter why immigration reform had not been enacted by late 2016. Gun control. On the morning of December 14, 2012, a 20-year-old man shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut, and killed 20 first-grade children and six adult school personnel in the second deadliest mass shooting by an individual in American history (the first being 2007’s Virginia Tech massacre). He had been armed with two handguns and a rifle that had a 30-round ammunition magazine. The horrific tragedy, along with recent deadly shooting incidents in Aurora, Colorado, and Tucson, Arizona, renewed the gun policy debate and prompted Washington to take steps toward reform. “We’re going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,” President Obama said in televised remarks on the day of the shooting ( Figure 12.4 ). LO 12-9 Figure 12.4. AP Images/Seth Perlman Nicole Hockley , a parent whose child was killed Sandy Hook testifies before Congress. Whose child was killed at Sandy Hook testifies before Congress. His administration would soon put forth measures to ban specific military- style assault rifles, to expand background checks, and to limit ammunition magazines, among other executive orders. Furthermore, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, worked together to draft legislation that would be more appealing to the Republican Party. Despite huge support from the general public, the Toomey-Manchin compromise gun control package suffered defeat in April 2013 in the Senate, where most Republicans and a handful of Democrats from rural states voted no after pressure from the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA). The President angrily responded that it was a “shameful day for Washington.” Yet, Obama’s critics pointed to the bill’s demise as a prime example of his greatest weakness: his inability to work with Congress. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd would write, “It’s unbelievable that with 90% of Americans on his side, he could get only 54 votes in the Senate.” Obama’s defenders contend, however, that no president could overcome the extraordinary power of the NRA with its massive contributions to the campaigns of many politicians. Climate control. The president managed to include a major piece of environmental reform in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which contained upward of $90 billion in subsidies for green energy. Since then, American solar power has experienced a six-fold increase, while wind generation has doubled. * His administration has also undertaken regulating gas mileage in cars, energy efficiency in appliances, fuel cleanliness, and power plant emissions. Yet, green activists have long lamented Obama’s apparent lack of a commitment to the climate agenda; Al Gore famously stated in a prominent 2011 Rolling Stone essay that the president has not made good on his promise for change. Defeat of the cap-and-trade bill of 2010, which sought to limit the country’s carbon output by setting caps on allowed gas emissions and permitting companies to buy and trade permits to pollute more, came to epitomize the Obama administration’s failure to implement a substantive climate policy. During his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama declared that he would direct his cabinet “to come up with executive actions … to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.” Al though it seemed like the administration was ready to implement substantive reform in its second term, Obama angered environmentalists when he hinted that he would approve the Keystone XL pipeline, an expansion of a pipeline system carrying oil from Canada and the northern United States to refineries in the Gulf Coast. To climate activists, the pipeline decision is of great symbolic and political importance; it sets the tone for how the administration will tackle climate change, they said. “Approving the pipeline would be a deep self-inflicted wound on the Obama administration, greater than anything else he has done,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune. * Obama had not taken a final position by fall of 2013. President Obama came to realize by early 2013 that he could not count on Congress to enact major climate legislation because of the power of lobbyists from the coal industry, as well as intense opposition from many Republicans. He decided he had to rely on his executive powers as president that allow him to propose and implement regulations. He gave a pivotal speech on June 25, 2013, where he said he would use the executive powers of the presidency to develop strong regulations over coal-burning power plants whose emissions, taken together, constituted 40% of American emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to be finalized by 2015. While the details remained unclear, this initiative, when combined with his other climate measures, placed him in the forefront of American presidents on climate control President Obama took the lead in establishing the Paris Climate Accord in 2015 that included nearly 200 nations in an agreement to cut greenhouse emissions in a single agree tackling climate change for the first time in history. While the U.S. had pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 that set emission cutting targets, it now assumed leadership to keep global temperatures from climbing more than 3.6 degrees above pre- industrial times, to review every nation’s contribution to cutting emissions every five years, and to have affluent nations help poorer nations finance the switch to renewable energy. Economic growth. Everyone agreed: The nation grew at a relatively slow pace in the wake of the Great Recession. Millions of Americans remained unemployed at the end of 2013. Yet many jobs were created from 2009 through 2013 as the nation slowly recovered from the worst recession since the Great Depression. Obama cannot claim credit for an economic upswing that resulted from many factors beyond his control, such as the global economy, policies of the Federal Reserve Board, and decisions of entrepreneurs and corporations. Republicans argued that sweeping cuts in government spending, as well as reductions in taxes of (mostly) affluent persons, would bring greater economic growth—but this assertion cannot be proven and contradicts the adage that increased government spending is needed during economic downturns to stimulate the economy. The decision of European nations to cut spending drastically was widely seen to contribute to their economic decline from 2009 to 2012—and their decision to increase government spending was widely seen as contributing to their economic resurgence. Obama’s hands were tied by the political gridlock: While he mostly succeeding in averting deep cuts in spending as desired by Republicans, he lacked the political power to increase spending while often asserting that increased spending on education, infrastructure, and technology would enhance American economic growth. Most experts laud Ben Bernanke for stimulating the economy throughout Obama’s first 5 years in office. Implementing the Af fordable Care Act. Even though Obama and the Democrats won a resounding victory in the 2012 presidential election where they supported the ACA, many Republicans, led by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, were determined to block its implementation. They threatened to shut down the government by not enacting a budget to fund its expenses if Obama failed to make key concessions to them, such as delaying its implementation for a full year. Republican governors and state legislators often refused to take advantage of a dramatic expansion of Medicaid totally funded by the federal government to provide health coverage for many low-income and single persons. They also refused in many states to implement the ACA’s “insurance exchanges” to provide information to persons to allow them to enroll in private insurance—forcing the federal government to implement the exchanges in their states. They attacked Obama for glitches in the website developed by the Department of Health and Human Services to allow citizens to obtain information about their insurance options. These tactics backfired. Obama refused to agree to concessions in budget talks. The administration developed insurance exchanges in those states but did not initiate them. It was too soon to tell how well the ACA would implement its many provisions, but it was clear by the end of 2013 that Republicans could not block its forward motion. The Runaway V ictory of the Republicans in 2014 The Congressional elections of 2014 followed the script of 2010: a landslide victory for the Republicans that gave them solid majorities in the House and Senate and that gave them control of even more Governorships and State Legislatures. Like 2010, Democrats’ turn out was relatively low among persons of color, single mothers, and white blue-collar voters. Republicans mobilized their voters by attacking Obama himself in ways that some commentators believed was racist. They decried “Obamacare” as contributing to medical inflation and slowing participation in insurance exchanges in various states. They attacked his “war on guns” as he attacked the ease with which persons could purchase guns, as well as continuing massacres of people by persons with mental conditions. They argued that he was enacting climate regulations that would decrease jobs. Some critics called him a “jihadist” who wanted to flood the nation with Muslim immigrants. Gridlock dominated the nation’s politics in 2015 and 2016. Unable to get legislation through the Congress, President Obama used his executive powers as president to issue regulations. He placed requirements on energy producers to reduce the levels of methane rising into the atmosphere. He mandated a 32% cut in carbon emissions by 2030 under the Clean Power Plan. He broadened the Clean Water Act to give it jurisdiction over small waterways that include wetlands and ponds. He reduced the allowable ozone level in air to be reduced from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. He established regulations on fracking for “well casing, transparency, and wastewater storage on federal land.” He issued regulations to erode Dodd-Frank regulations that set controls on banks in 2010. He backed a rule intended to protect retirees from faulty investment recommendations. He supported an overtime rule by the Department of Labor that increased pay for 4 million Americans by requiring overtime pay at “time and a half” over 40 hours a week. He supported a Labor Department requirement that companies disclose how much they pay for anti-union consultants who often try to counter union drives. He supported Labor Department regulations that require federal contractors to report past labor violations when they sought government contracts. He supported regulations favored by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that prohibited financial companies from initiating class- action lawsuits against companies, as well as that sought to outlaw excessive interest rates on borrowing. He favored menu labels by restaurants and grocery stores that list calorie counts for foods they sell. He supported regulations of manufacturers of electronic cigarettes, cigars, and hookah. Republicans often viewed these and other regulations of the Obama Administration as an unjust exercise of federal power over corporations. Democrats countered that they would help preserve the environment, protect the rights of workers, and safeguard the rights of consumers. Evaluate the Most Conservative Supreme Court in Four Decades Using four sets of data, some political scientists concluded that the U.S. Supreme Court had become the most conservative one in four decades. * They argued that most court rulings can be assigned an “ideological value.” Relatively liberal courts, they decided, contract the role of religion, oppose direct participation by corporations and unions in elections, favor abortion rights and affirmative action, favor protections for persons accused of crimes, support gun-control laws, favor legal rights for noncitizens suspected of terrorism, and place restrictions on the use of the death penalty. They argued that the Supreme Court had dramatically shifted toward a conservative posture when Justice Sandra Day O’Connor resigned from the court and was replaced by Justice Samuel Alito. If O’Connor had been a centrist judge who often sided with relatively liberal justices in key rulings in close 5–4 votes, Alito joined the conservative majority in many votes. He joined forces with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy against liberal Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and David Souter. Kennedy now became the potential “swing vote,” but, unlike O’Connor, he mostly voted with the conservative justices. Obama could not change this conservative balance: He would only have a chance to replace retiring liberal justices, not conservative ones. While he appointed liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to replace Justices Souter and Stevens, respectively, in 2009 and 2010, the fundamental 5–4 conservative majority remained. Some of the court’s rulings were disappointing to liberals in the wake of O’Connor’s departure in 2006. They eased protections against unreasonable LO 12-10 searches by police, upheld the federal ban on partial-birth abortions, refused to hear a case allowing public schools to use race to achieve integration, and allowed corporations and trade unions to fund campaigns of specific candidates for public office rather than only running issue advertisements. Obama openly criticized the latter decision on the grounds that it could give corporations and trade unions undue influence in political races—perhaps by electing bank-friendly legislators and legislators friendly to health insurance companies. Liberals also feared that the Supreme Court might overturn Roe v. Wade , the historic decision in 1973 that had made it illegal for states to ban abortions during the first trimester. Furthermore, it invalidated a major piece of civil rights legislation in the Voting Rights Act, ruling that nine states with a history of voter discrimination no longer needed federal oversight of election law changes. (As a result, Texas quickly enacted its previously blocked voter ID law, which requires that voters produce certain types of photo identification in order to cast a ballot. This law can potentially disenfranchise up to 800,000 registered voters in the state who lack a government-issued photo ID. (This ruling made it likely that many of the laws enacted by Republicans in many states to discourage voting by young people and minorities would remain intact.) Even further, the Court may have endangered affirmative action policies in public institutions of higher learning across the nation by issuing a strict standard: Colleges and universities must demonstrate that “available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice” before considering race as a means of diversifying their student bodies. Yet the Supreme Court made some rulings that pleased many liberals. It ruled the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 that denied federal benefits to gay couples married under state law to be unconstitutional. It let stand a lower court ruling that declared Proposition 8 in California, which outlawed gay marriage, to be unconstitutional. It upheld the constitutionality of the “individual mandate” of the Affordable Care Act that imposed a monetary penalty on persons who failed to obtain health insurance. In a surprising decision engineered by Chief Justice Roberts, the court upheld the ACA not on the basis of the commerce clause but on the basis of the federal power of taxation. This was a pivotal decision because it undermined Republicans’ insistence that the ACA should be repealed. It strengthened Obama’s campaign of 2012 by providing legitimacy to his most important enactment. As we discuss subsequently, it refused to support state bans on gay marriage. The death of Antonin Scalia in early 2016 gave President Obama an opportunity to add another chief justice to the court that could give liberal and moderate justices a majority. The Republican-dominated Congress refused to give a moderate justice a hearing, leaving this decision to the next president. Recognize the Oppression of V ulnerable Groups The Continuing Oppression of Poor People EP 1a EP 2a EP 3a EP 3b EP 5a EP 5b EP 5c In what has become a classic discussion of institutionalized inequality in the United States, author Barbara Ehrenreich, in her book Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America , analyzed the lives of waitresses, WalMart employees, and housecleaning crews. * Living paycheck to paycheck in low-wage jobs, these women eked out a bare existence. Many of them worked at as many as three jobs to make ends meet. If they had families, they could not count on receiving quality child care. Rarely receiving health insurance while encountering unsafe or stressful working conditions, they LO 12-11 often delayed seeking health care even when they had serious health problems. Over 50% of persons who qualify for Food Stamps do not use them, often because they are unaware that they are eligible since the federal government only sporadically advertises the program. Similarly, only a fraction of eligible families use the Earned Income Tax Credit and S/CHIP medical insurance for children in low-income families, which left about 9 million children uninsured in 2007. Antipoverty advocacy groups could not win even inflation-adjusted increases in many safety net programs during the Bush administration— though the Democratic Congress obtained increases in the minimum wage in 2007. The average benefit of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or the Food Stamps Program), for example, was only $1 per meal per person, which is an insufficient amount to meet the nutritional needs of low-income recipients. The growing gap between rich and poor persons is a troublesome trend in the United States. If inequality markedly diminished from World War II to the late 1960s, it markedly increased in ensuing decades to the present, despite a slight decline during the economic boom of the 1990s. Between 2000 and 2004, 5.3 million additional persons fell into poverty—leaving 37 million people (or one in eight Americans) below the federal poverty line of a $20,000 annual income for a family of four. About 25 million Americans sought assistance from food banks in 2006—about 20% more than in 1997 (see Insert 12.2 ). Insert 12.2. Critical Analysis: Should W e Be Concerned about Relative Poverty? Poverty is usually discussed in terms of persons’ ability to afford bare essentials, such as food and housing. Indeed, the nation’s official poverty standard is geared to the value of a “market basket” of specific goods that are needed for bare survival. Persons who use this approach count the number of persons who fall beneath official poverty standards. Alternatively, poverty can be measured in relative rather than market- basket terms. Persons who use this approach measure the degree of resource discrepancy between, say, persons living in the bottom 20% and persons in the top 20% of the economic order. Assume that the United States did largely eradicate market-basket poverty. Would it matter if relative poverty kept climbing until it reached levels that existed in the Gilded Age at the end of the 19th century? What specific kinds of negative or positive consequences would persons at the bottom of the economic order experience, as well as persons at the top of the economic order? Americans have often focused on hardships of racial and ethnic groups while giving far less attention to social class partly because their polyglot society makes other characteristics, such as race and ethnicity, so prominent, unlike more homogeneous European and Asian nations. * Social class has been an important characteristic of the United States from its inception. Not only does it exist, but the United States currently possesses more economic inequality than most European nations, Canada, or Japan (as we discuss in more detail in the next chapter ). Poverty wreaks an extraordinary toll on those who experience it, whether it is measured by official federal poverty levels or by a person’s income falling within the two lowest quintiles of the population. Consider the health of affluent persons compared with low-income persons. Affluent people encounter more favorable environments than do poor people: they are less likely to experience violent encounters; can engage in recreation in safe places; have grocery stores that give them a greater choice of products at cheaper prices; live in healthy environments that do not contain vermin, lead paint, or crowding; live near their jobs or have convenient transportation; and do not have to change residences frequently due to their inability to pay rent. They are not plagued by economic insecurity, such as frequently experiencing unemployment. They do not have to work multiple jobs to be economically secure. They have the resources to take periodic vacations. They do not have to deal with demeaning welfare agencies or long waits in emergency rooms. They have relatively good schools. They usually have health insurance, and are unlikely to lose it. They do not have to make difficult economic choices, like whether to pay rent or buy food, medications, or health care. Poor persons are more likely to view themselves as marginal members of society. They realize that they live in smaller residences than do affluent people, have more graffiti and broken windows, attend poorer schools, and are less likely to graduate from high school or achieve post-high school degrees. Poverty often interferes with progress through high school and into community colleges and beyond. Low-income parents are less likely to read to their children. They are less likely to engage them in conversations. Low- income children often hear fewer words in their homes than do affluent children. Low-income parents are less likely than are affluent ones to convey the expectation that children will go to college and into professions —as are the teachers who instruct them. They are more likely to be tracked in schools into vocational classes or ones that are less demanding. Persons who have exited the school system before completing high school, or who have not proceeded beyond high school, are more likely to be unemployed for short or long stints. They are more likely to hold unskilled jobs that offer them low pay and benefits. Low-income persons often have to hold several jobs to meet their survival needs. Low-income persons are more likely than other persons to be renters—and more likely to have to move frequently or to be evicted because they cannot pay their rent. When taken together, these experiences and self-perceptions often lead to negative health and economic outcomes. Marginal status has been shown to induce adverse physiological responses, such as higher stress-response hormones, elevated blood pressure, progressive damage to organs, and compromised immune systems. * When coupled with poverty, substantial inequality is a predictor of disparities in health outcomes; thus, poor people in many European nations, which have lower inequalities than the United States, live longer and are healthier than their American counterparts. * Low-income persons have lower life expectancies and greater rates of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. They are more likely to smoke, to have obese lifestyle choices, and to have sedentary lifestyles. They are more likely to be disabled, or not to be able to engage in one or more activities of daily living. * Social class and race often intersect. African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and some Asian Americans (such as Cambodian and Vietnamese refugees) are far more likely to be poor, to have limited education, and to have poorer health than are whites. Social class and gender also intersect, as the term “feminization of poverty” suggests. White males with a high school education or less have become markedly poorer during the last three decades—and are possibly the group that has descended most rapidly in American society as relatively unskilled and unionized jobs in industry have migrated to other nations or disappeared. Black males who have only high school educations (or less) are likely to be poor—and are more likely than white youths with low levels of education to be incarcerated or on parole. Many whites are also poor, such as white males who have not received education beyond high school and single mothers. The Great Recession disproportionately harmed poor people. Women with low-income jobs—such as Alexandria Wallace of Tucson, Arizona—who had left welfare rolls, often had to return to the rolls because states cut child care subsidies, even though welfare reform in 1996 had promised women who left welfare rolls that they would receive subsidized childcare. * Child care absorbs nearly one-third of the income of working mothers who earn poverty-line wages of $18,310 for a family of three. Unemployment was particularly burdensome to persons who suffered from chronic or long-term unemployment lasting 6 months or longer. They often became so discouraged about finding work that they stopped looking for it —or resorted to part-time positions. In June 2010, more than 6.3 million Americans and 46% of all unemployed workers had been unemployed for more than 6 months—the highest number since 1948. * The Great Recession exacted an emotional toll on workers and families as measured by a survey of them. * Almost half of unemployed workers experienced anxiety or depression, which often became more acute as their unemployment lengthened. Half reported conflicts or arguments in their homes. Nearly half of respondents indicated they felt ashamed or embarrassed sometimes or most of the time. About 47% of unemployed persons reported that they lacked health insurance or health care coverage —and 54% reported they cut back on doctors’ visits or medical treatments. About one-fifth reported they received food from a nonprofit or religious institution. Sixty-one percent reported that their unemployment benefits were insufficient to cover their basic necessities. Many older workers were harmed by the Great Recession. Many had wanted to delay retirements to enhance their Social Security benefits— which increase as workers delay retirement beyond age 62. Many unemployed workers had to collect benefits earlier for financial reasons, leaving them with far less income in their retirement years at a time when many Americans are living into their 80s and beyond. * We have discussed the intersection of social class and race, but we should remember that middle-class persons of color are also more vulnerable in recessions than are white middle-class persons—and more likely to descend into poverty during deep recessions. Black middle-class persons making $68,000 per year were five times more likely to hold high-interest subprime mortgages than whites with similar or lower income in the New York region: Banks had targeted them with these high-interest loans after years of refusing to lend to them. * These lenders made huge profits by using loose lending standards and high interest rates—and by preying on persons of color who often avoided conventional banks because they had been rebuffed by them in prior years. Black middle-class families were often more vulnerable to foreclosures than were white families, moreover, because they had lower net worth. Foreclosures were devastating to some black neighborhoods, as vacant and boarded-up houses led to further devaluations of home values and yet more foreclosures. The Great Recession made decades of economic gains vanish for blacks in Memphis. * The unemployment rate gap between blacks and whites had shrunk from 12 percentage points to less than 6 percentage points from 1985 to 2007 in the United States, allowing the rise of a black working class and middle class, but it had risen to a gap of 8% by 2010. In cities like Memphis, the black median income receded to its level in the late 1980s, where black unemployment had risen to 16.9% as compared with only 5.3% for whites. The Great Recession made apparent that tens of millions of Americans are perilously close to poverty. Lynn LoPuck and Elizabeth Warren, a law professor at Harvard, had demonstrated that millions of married couples— including those where one or more spouse had graduate and professional degrees—descended into poverty when either spouse became unemployed because they often bought relatively expensive houses with substantial mortgages in order to live in safe neighborhoods with excellent schools. * Mortgaged to the limits of their economic capacity, they often could not make their mortgage payments when they lost their double income. Less- affluent couples were even more vulnerable economically if one of them became unemployed in light of the cost of homes, child care, and (in some cases) parochial or private schools. Single parents with one or more children were even more vulnerable to loss of work—or the loss of even one of the several jobs they often held to make ends meet, particularly when they received scant or no alimony payments. As Republicans and Democrats sparred over the details of federal budgets in 2011 and 2012, it became clear just how wide the ideological gulf between the parties had become with respect to safety-net programs. The Democratic Party had become somewhat more liberal, but the Republican Party had become considerably more conservative with only several Republican moderates left in the House and the Senate. Leaders of the two parties developed divergent proposals for cutting the nation’s unsustainable debt as we have discussed throughout this chapter. For example, the EITC is intended to provide an incentive to work and to offset Social Security payroll taxes that are otherwise onerous for many low-income persons. Individuals and couples who care for qualified children receive a tax refund when they qualify for a tax credit that exceeds the amount of taxes that they owe. A family with three or more qualified children with income less than $43,279, if the couple is married, can receive a maximum tax refund , for example, of as much as $5,657 when they fill out a W-5 tax form during the year. Qualified children include ones who are 18 or younger, ones who are 23 years of age or younger who are full-time students for 5 calendar months, and children of any age who are found by physicians to be permanently and totally disabled. Research shows that cutting the EITC, as some conservatives favor, would discourage work since persons have to work to obtain its benefit. Cuts would also increase poverty. It decreases use of welfare. * The Continuing Oppression of W omen Women and their children bear the brunt of America’s poverty. The United States needs a policy geared toward helping female single heads of household to enter the social and economic mainstream. We have discussed in this chapter how the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Act of 1996 reduced welfare rolls by 50% in its first 6 years of implementation but also how it failed to upgrade the long-term earning capacity of many female heads of household by emphasizing brief job placement services rather than extended training and education. Because women with a high school education or less often cannot earn substantially more than poverty- level wages or have strong promotion prospects, they need not only to upgrade their job-related skills but to complete high school and obtain 2- year or 4-year college degrees. (Significant research suggested that so- called certificates, such as in cosmetology, have limited value in job markets unlike community college and college degrees. * ) States and the federal government should therefore have invested billions of dollars annually in helping welfare recipients and former recipients—as well as impoverished single heads of household generally—to obtain these degrees, even if such training and education meant that women’s entry into the labor force would be delayed or periodically interrupted. Single heads of household need career and training plans that can, over a period of time, enhance their earnings prospects as they alternate work, training, and education. Indeed, it makes sense not to treat poorly educated female heads of household as a separate group since any worker, female or male, who lacks sufficient education or training is likely to be poverty-stricken. (Male workers with no more than high school education also face bleak economic prospects.) President Obama developed a promising policy in July 2009 when he announced a $12 billion community college initiative over 10 years to increase dramatically the number of graduates from them. Now existing in virtually every geographic area, they can develop and implement programs to enhance students’ careers. Enrolled persons often will get child care, medical care, and transportation subsidies while receiving training and related work experiences. Many women fail to receive any, or sufficient, child care subsidies, requiring them to use such a large portion of their wages for child care that they fall under official poverty standards. While the enactment of the TANF included child care subsidies, funding remained flat for many years. With attention focused on younger women, less attention is devoted to the economic and social problems of older women—who will constitute a significant majority of the baby boom population in coming decades. Due to high divorce rates, many female retirees are single and must rely on their own savings, assets, and pensions. They usually have lower savings than men, not only because they had to interrupt their work careers to have children, but because they worked in lower-paying occupations. Since far fewer women than men get pensions from their former employers, they must rely on relatively low Social Security benefits. Since many of them do not own houses, they are vulnerable to rising rents. Women in their 80s and 90s often develop chronic health problems that are not covered by Medicare, forcing them to spend down to receive Medicaid. Nor are married women immune from these economic and social problems during retirement. As women typically outlive their husbands, widows often find their finances depleted by the medical costs used by their deceased partners or by other costs that the couple incurred before his death. * Because women live, on average, into their mid-80s, they must often exhaust their savings—forcing them onto SSI and Medicaid as they deplete their assets. A considerable majority of baby boomers will be elderly women in coming decades. The nation has not even begun to prepare for this massive demographic shift. A large labor force of trained and well-paid home health aides will be needed, not to mention geriatric nurses, doctors, and social workers. Community-based networks of support services, respite services for caregivers, and day services need to be developed following innovative models already in operation in specific locations. Civil rights legislation helped many women get training, education, and economic positions that would have been unthinkable decades earlier. Women still struggle, however, with myriad issues that defy easy solution. Violence against women remains at high levels in their homes with uneven protection of them by the police as well as inadequate prosecutions of violent offenders. Predatory sexual behaviors plague many women in colleges, workplaces, and elsewhere. Many women continue to report extensive on-the-job sexual harassment in both blue-collar and white-collar jobs. Female workers with children often suffer job discrimination from employers and supervisors who believe they are less reliable than childless workers—leading to dismissals or denial of promotions. Revisions of existing civil rights statutes in many states, as well as of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), are needed to protect the rights of women more fully. The FMLA should be revised so that it actually funds leaves for parents and caregivers rather than merely allowing them to take unpaid leaves. Some progress did occur, such as the enactment of a revised Violence Against Women Act and the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to let stand a lower court ruling declaring the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, as we have already discussed. Many young women, as well as men, often receive inadequate sex education in schools that focuses only on abstinence even though extensive research shows that abstinence-only sex education is less effective than sex education that presents a range of options. * The Obama administration made major changes in sex-education programs so that they gave youth a range of options, including contraception. School districts should be funded and mandated to provide contraceptives to students as is already the case for many innovative districts and in European nations. Four incidents in 2012 illustrate how policies regarding women continued to be embroiled in ideological conflict. In incident 1, the Komen Foundation, a widely respected organization that funds breast cancer awareness, treatment, and research, had given grants to Planned Parenthood for its cancer testing for many years, but abruptly announced it would stop funding it in spring 2012. A massive protest ensued as women used Facebook and other social media to attack this decision. Some protesters alleged that the foundation had been influenced by evangelicals to protest the contraception and abortion services of Planned Parenthood. The Komen Foundation apologized for cutting off Planned Parenthood and resumed its grants to the organization. The Foundation became embroiled in internal conflicts, however, as three top executives resigned amid reports that some Catholic bishops had pressured Komen to rescind the grant and as Komen’s local affiliates in Texas, Arizona, and Louisiana reported shortfalls in fundraising campaigns. In incident 2, Catholic bishops protested the inclusion of mandatory coverage of women’s contraception services in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010—legislation that mandated that insurance companies fund specific preventive services found by researchers to be effective. They contended that the government infringed on the separation of church and state by requiring Catholic hospitals and universities to fund contraception when it violated Catholics’ religious views. President Obama forged a compromise that held that private health insurance used by these hospitals and universities should fund contraceptive services—not the Catholic institutions themselves. When Republicans sided with the bishops, Democrats charged that Republicans opposed funding of contraception due to their insensitivity to women’s health needs. In incident 3, Democrats invited Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown University law student, to testify before a House subcommittee in favor of the government mandate to fund women’s contraceptive services. When the Republican leadership refused to allow her to testify, Democrats invited her to testify before a group of Democratic representatives, where she contended that contraception is a women’s health issue that should be funded by private health insurance or by government programs like Medicaid for several reasons. Many low-income women cannot afford physician visits and pills or other contraceptive devices. Many women need contraception for health reasons, such as the timing of having children or for medical reasons that would make pregnancy harmful at particular points in their lives. Rush Limbaugh, the outspoken Republican radio commentator, entered the fray by contending over the next 5 days that female birth control is tantamount to promiscuity and sex for hire—and calling Fluke a “slut” and a “prostitute” and asking her to provide the public with a videotape of herself engaging in sexual relations since the public would pay for her contraceptives through persons’ health insurance premiums. Some Republicans condemned his language, but Mitt Romney, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, remained silent. President Obama called Fluke to congratulate her for stating her opinions in a public venue. In incident 4, the U.S. Senate began proceedings in spring 2012 to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act that Congress had enacted in 1994—legislation that provides funds for police departments and agencies to aid victims of domestic violence and to prosecute domestic violence offenders. It had been reauthorized with bipartisan support on prior occasions, but conservative senators announced their opposition on grounds the legislation would be expanded. It would include Indian tribes, rural areas, and same-sex couples. It would allow more battered illegal immigrants to obtain temporary visas. It would expand the definition of violence against women to include stalking. It would train court personnel to help families with domestic violence. Many Republicans contended that Democratic senators used the issue to entice women to vote for Democrats in the congressional and presidential elections of 2012. Democratic senators retorted that “Republican opposition falls into a larger picture of insensitivity toward women that has progressed from abortion rights to contraception to preventive health care coverage—and now to domestic violence.” Republican Senator Li Murkowski from Alaska warned her Republican colleagues that their party has been successfully portrayed as anti-woman by Democrats. * An expanded version of the legislation was finally enacted in 2013 partly because Republicans wanted to avoid further deterioration of support for their Party from women than had already occurred during the presidential election of 2012. The Continuing Oppression of Immigrants When Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 with bipartisan support, many persons believed that the nation had resolved immigration issues for the foreseeable future. Surely, they reasoned, the granting of amnesty to 3 million undocumented immigrants, as well as the establishment of sanctions against employers who hired them in the future, would stabilize the movement of persons into the United States who lacked green cards or other visas. To the contrary, as many as 12 million undocumented immigrants resided in the United States by 2007, principally from Mexico and Central America, but also from Asia, Russia, and some European nations. A diaspora of Latino immigrants had fanned across the nation, holding jobs in virtually every community in the United States in construction, ranching, mining, restaurant, hotel, manufacturing, hospital, nursing and convalescent homes, care of seniors in their homes, and other positions. The nation expends vast resources on law enforcement activities. Border agents caught more than 1 million Mexicans a year and escorted them back across the border in so-called “voluntary departure” during 2006 although far fewer crossed the border in succeeding years. Another 200,000 per year were officially deported under “formal removals”—with more than 40% of this group possessing criminal records. In addition, large numbers of border patrol agents and members of the National Guard had been deployed to the border; other border control measures included construction of fences, installation of surveillance devices, and use of airplanes. A cumbersome system of admitting immigrants was in place in 2007 that frustrated everyone. Employers who wanted skilled workers because they could not find American citizens for specific jobs had to demonstrate that they were not discriminating against American citizens. They had to advertise these positions and require either a master’s degree or a bachelor’s degree with 5 years of experience to claim they needed “skilled” workers— and then hope that the workers they hired could obtain green cards (or permanent residency visas) and then citizenship under the annual quotas on the number of immigrants from each country of origin. Since only a limited number of green cards are issued, other workers had to secure temporary worker visas under the H-1B program. These workers are required to work for specific employers for up to 6 years, at which time they must leave the United States. Many companies had to use this kind of visa because they could not get green cards for many job applicants—and even H-1B visas were greatly oversubscribed, requiring Immigration Services to use a lottery to fill positions. Applications were often lost or delayed in a bureaucratic labyrinth. * A robust movement developed in the United States for new immigration legislation to give these immigrants basic rights and services—and to do away with cumbersome bureaucratic procedures. In 2006, it orchestrated massive demonstrations in large American cities and in Washington, DC, urging the enactment of federal immigration legislation—more than 2 million demonstrators gathered in more than 120 cities called by an alliance of churches, unions, regional grassroots groups, and national policy organizations. Only entitled to emergency medical services, immigrants often lacked police protection as well as access to an array of federal and state safety net programs, mental health services, subsidized child care, Head Start, and many other programs. They were often reluctant even to use educational and emergency health services for fear that they would be reported to and deported by the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) established in 2001 pursuant to the Homeland Security Act. Advocates for immigrants contended that immigrants deserved these rights and services in return not only for their labor and their payment of payroll and other taxes, but to preserve their fundamental human rights. The cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, as well as the mismatch between demand for visas and green cards and their supply, gave many immigrants an incentive to enter the United States illegally and to use forged documents. Many of them perished in the desert that they had to cross on the Southern border. It also gave employers who could not find American workers the incentive not to check immigrants’ credentials carefully—and to knowingly hire undocumented workers. Bipartisan immigration legislation coauthored by Senators Ted Kennedy and John McCain and endorsed by President George W. Bush emerged in the spring of 2007. It would have given a considerable share of the 12 million undocumented immigrant residents amnesty—and established a large guest worker program. Immigrants would no longer have had to go through the Department of Labor and Immigration Services, but could have applied on their own for work visas under a merit-based point system that would have awarded points for work experience, education, English skills, having a high-demand occupation, and family ties. Only persons with relatively high scores would have gained admission. This legislation ran into crossfire from conservatives and liberals. Many employers feared that the large mismatch between the supply of and demand for visas would remain, so that employers would have to hire whoever won this lottery rather than picking the employees they wanted as they had done under the existing system. Many conservatives viewed immigrants not as residents who deserved civil rights and access to social programs, but as criminals who ought to be caught and deported—all 12 million of them. Many of them doubted that 400 miles of additional border fencing and other surveillance measures would stem the flow of undocumented immigrants to the United States—and they feared that amnesty for many families would only further increase the inflow of the family members and friends that immigrants had left behind in their native country. Liberals wanted more weight to be given to family ties and less to the other factors. Often wanting immediate amnesty for undocumented persons who had worked in the United States for a specified period, they objected to requirements that these residents had to identify themselves to authorities and pay a fine of $5,000 only to get less than full legal status and the right to stay and apply for a permanent “Z visa” that would only be issued once the amplified border surveillance measures had been put in place. * While Democrats overwhelmingly supported the legislation, opposition from Republicans ultimately defeated it. Many Democrats vowed to secure immigration reforms if they won the presidency and majorities in Congress in 2008. President Obama deferred action on immigration legislation, however, because he was preoccupied with economic and health reforms. He tried, however, to enact the Dream Act to give college scholarships to youth brought to the United States by their undocumented parents when they were children, but failed to get it approved in the lame-duck sessions of Congress in late 2010. Many states decided to enact their own immigration legislation. Led by its Republican Governor Jan Brewer, Arizona enacted immigration legislation in 2010, for example, that gave police the authority to stop and interrogate persons whom they suspected might be undocumented persons even when they had committed no unlawful act. Many Latinos were outraged by this policy because some police might detain and interrogate people who were citizens or were in the United States legally. A judge had declared parts of this legislation to be unconstitutional in summer 2010, but the governor immediately appealed this decision to another court. Other punitive state laws were struck down by courts from 2011 onward. President Obama had followed a conflicting strategy toward immigrants in his first term. His administration deported more than one million persons by late 2011. * Obama signaled in August 2011 that he favored immigration reform if elected for a second term when he announced that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Justice Department would limit deportations to those undocumented persons that had committed crimes rather than raiding employers’ workforces. He also signaled his wish to improve conditions for immigrants by supporting the DREAM ACT in the U.S. Senate in 2011 to give federal student aid to undocumented youth who had been brought to the United States as children by their undocumented parents—and who were attending community colleges and colleges. Why not, he argued, give them citizenship when they came to the United States through no fault of their own as children—and who viewed themselves as Americans. Conservatives defeated the legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2012 that Arizona’s restrictive immigration law was unconstitutional because it was preempted by the U.S. Constitution that gives power over immigration policies to the federal government and not to the states. It gave Arizona police the power to ask for persons’ citizenship papers only if they had been arrested for a crime— and even then placed restrictions on police power. No longer, they argued, could Arizona ask for papers from persons they detained because they looked like undocumented immigrants. President Obama and his staff, as well as bipartisan U.S. senators, quietly drafted comprehensive immigration reforms in the early days of 2013 prior to the president pledging to enact them in his State of the Union address. Included in the package were proposals to increase funding for border security, expand access to visa programs for more high- and low-skilled workers, and to offer a 13-year path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented citizens currently residing in the country. Partly because some Republican Senators believed that their party could not win the presidency if they failed to obtain greater support from Latinos than it received in the presidential election of 2012, they developed a bipartisan agreement with Senate Democrats on immigration reform. They agreed to support the legislation only if it added 20,000 border control officers and expended an additional $4.5 billion on drone aircraft, sensors, and expansion of the border wall—and only if many immigrants would have to wait more than 10 years to become citizens. The immigration bill survived its first day of consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2013—and was soon enacted in the U.S. Senate. The House of Representatives failed to approve it by November 2013 due to a split in the Republican Party. While a small number of House Republican moderates as well as most Democrats favored a version similar to the one enacted by the Senate, many Tea Party Republicans remained strongly opposed to such legislation so it remained stalled in the House in late 2013. Many Latino’s disliked President Obama’s deportation of many immigrants in his first term, but Obama focused more on the deportation of immigrants who had committed criminal infractions during his second term. He also was determined not to abandon the Dreamers who had been brought to the United States as children by their undocumented parents. President Obama was unable to obtain legislation that would protect Latino youth who had migrated to the United States as children with their undocumented parents. Using the regulatory power of the president, Obama put in place an immigration policy that allowed these roughly 800,000 immigrants to receive two years of deferred action from deportation subject to their enrolling in a program titled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). They had to provide personal data to the federal government to receive deferred action and to obtain work permits. Many of them feared that the government might require them to leave the nation after the two years, particularly if a Republican won the presidency in 2016. Their futures would hinge upon the actions of Donald Trump and Republicans, as I discuss in Chapter 13 . President Obama encountered two additional immigration issues in his second term. More than 200,000 children and adolescents crossed the Southern border in 2014 through 2016 from Central American nations such as El Salvador due to poverty and to join family members who had crossed the Southern border earlier. Many of them perished on this trip where they climbed on top of trains for transportation. Girls were often raped. They were housed in makeshift quarters in the United States because Congressional Republicans would not enact legislation that would provide $3 billion to meet their housing and medical needs. The sheer size of this flow of young people decreased by 2017—as did immigration of adults across the border—partly due to hostility by President Trump to immigrants as well as improved economic conditions in Mexico. Yet another immigration crisis emerged in the wake of political unrest in Syria, the Middle East, and Africa as hundreds of thousands of immigrants fled ISIS, civil wars, and famine. They often sought refugee status that allowed persons subject to terrorism and civil wars to enter the United States. These refugees often died as they boarded makeshift boats to cross the Mediterranean Sea, only then to seek sanctuary in many European nations. The United State resettled 84,994 refugees in financial year 2016, for example—and President Obama admitted even more of them in the succeeding year. As we will see in Chapter 13 , immigration became a major issue in the presidential campaign of 2016. The Continuing Oppression of Racial and Ethnic Vulnerable Populations In the case of ethnic and racial out-groups, intermarriage has somewhat blurred distinctions between white, African American, Latino, Native American, and Asian populations. A leading analyst of this trend, Richard Rodriguez, argues, “all things brown in time.” He disputes the concept that Latinos are a racial group, noting “there are many cultures in Latin America” as well as physical characteristics such as skin color. He notes the emergence of new terms, such as “Blexicans” to describe persons of Latino and African American descent and “Hinjews” for persons of East Indian and Jewish descent. He predicts the U.S. Census will soon not even use racial categories, as more and more people find them to be inapplicable. Rodriguez’s argument may be ahead of its time, however, because many people still describe themselves as belonging to a specific racial group, live in areas and attend schools dominated by it, are perceived by others as coming from it, and experience discrimination in employment and other places based on it. The harsh realities of race are clear in Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent to the Supreme Court decision that struck down the point system that gave 20 points to every minority person who applied to the University of Michigan’s undergraduate program. She wrote: In the wake of a system of racial caste only recently ended … large disparities endure. Unemployment, poverty and access to health care vary by race. Neighborhoods and schools remain racially divided. African American and Hispanic children are all too often educated in poverty-stricken and under-performing institutions. Adult African Americans and Hispanics generally earn less than whites with equivalent levels of education. … Bias both conscious and unconscious, reflecting traditional and unexamined habits of thought, keeps up barriers that must come down if equal opportunity and nondiscrimination are ever genuinely to become this country’s law and practice. * Ginsburg’s comments suggest that the terms out-group and vulnerable population are not outmoded. On virtually every indicator of well-being, African Americans, Latinos/as, and Native Americans lag behind the general population. Her comments also apply to many other groups for whom these terms remain appropriate. Latinos have made major gains in the United States with the creation of a large middle class and affluent class. The Latino population leaped by 58% from 1990 to 2007, numbering 35.3 million persons, as compared with growth of the African American population by only 16%. Today, Latinos are the largest minority group in 23 states, including Midwestern states such as Iowa and Nebraska. * The U.S. Census Bureau predicts that 20% of the U.S. population will be persons of Latino/a descent by 2020. The rapid growth of the Latino/a population has created a kind of role reversal with respect to African Americans. Together, African Americans and Latinos/as constitute roughly 25% of the nation’s population; these groups could, if they worked together, secure major reforms in local, state, and federal jurisdictions. Indeed, major advocacy groups, such as the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the NAACP, and the National Council of La Raza, have collaborated on getting more accurate census counts. But friction exists between these two vulnerable populations. If African American advocacy groups have traditionally emphasized civil rights, the Latino/a groups emphasize upgrading schools, economic issues, and immigration. * Although Obama has enjoyed popularity with the overwhelming majority of African American households, some members of the black scholarly community have been vocal with their criticism about his so-called lack of a domestic policy with regard to urban poverty. Broadcaster and author Tavis Smiley, along with professor Cornel West, led the charge against the president, accusing him of ignoring and remaining silent on the plight of blacks. Yet far more than 90% of African Americans voted for Obama in 2012. The Continuing Oppression of Populations that Are Physically or Mentally Challenged Despite the successes of many persons who are covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, many others live in institutional settings or cannot find employment because they lack the kinds of occupational and social services needed to mainstream them. The poverty rates of the disabled population exceed even the rates of some racial minority groups—and they often are unemployed at rates two times that of the general population. Some benefit from workplace accommodations that enable them to be productive employees, but many disabled persons are unemployed or not offered special accommodations to which they are entitled under federal law. Many of them cannot find affordable housing that has also been reconstructed to meet their special needs, such as specially designed kitchens, bathrooms, and wheelchair ramps. Many of them lack personal assistance with daily chores or help with transportation—assistance that can be crucial to getting and keep jobs or remaining at home. In short, the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, enacted in 1990, has given physically and mentally challenged persons rights, but not sufficient nonmedical assistance. * Great progress was made in treating persons with HIV in the 1990s with the development of a cocktail of drugs that slowed the development of AIDS and helped many persons with AIDS survive longer or even have normal life expectancies. Yet many persons with AIDS were thrown into poverty by their medical costs, side effects of drugs, and mental trauma. AIDS advocates were disheartened by Congress’s decision to rewrite the Ryan White Care Act in December 2006 to decrease assistance for support programs like meals and legal aid—and to allow five new cities to join the program without providing additional funding so that services provided to cities such as New York and San Francisco were deeply cut—even as the Republican Congress capped its funding at $2.1 billion over the last several years. These cuts were devastating because 40,000 additional persons contracted HIV each year, as women and persons of color have become the majority of new cases—and as more AIDS patients live longer and require prescription drugs that can cost thousands of dollars per month. * Under these circumstances, administrators using Ryan White funds increasingly must choose to fund only medicines rather than provide support, food, transportation, and housing services. Access to medicines became even more important, however, when medical researchers discovered that HIV drugs help persons with HIV to live longer and healthier lives—even preventing AIDS from developing. When the Affordable Care Act allowed states to raise Medicaid eligibility levels, many people gained access to these drugs once Medicaid waived a provision in 2014 that required persons to have a diagnosis of AIDS to receive them. Now tens of thousands of persons with HIV receive these life-saving medications. As we discuss in Chapter 13 , however, the quest to repeal the ACA in the Trump presidency threatened to curtail access to these medications if the ACA were to be repealed. Mentally challenged persons also encounter serious problems. The overall impact of mental illness in industrialized nations is staggering, with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating that mental illness and suicide account for more than 15% of the total mortality and disability burden—more than all kinds of cancer combined. The United States spends about $130 billion per year on mental health treatment including federal prescription coverage—with about 58% of this amount devoted to the 12 million Americans with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. * Also staggering are the sheer numbers of these 12 million Americans who are homeless or in prison—about 25% of prison inmates and 33% of homeless persons. Slots in supervised group homes and shared apartments are difficult to find. Absent other options, local authorities place 284,000 persons with mental conditions in prisons each year, where they seldom receive mental health services. * The nation’s community mental health centers are insufficiently funded and staffed to handle the estimated 44 million Americans suffering from mental disorders. * Funding by the states for mental services has declined by 30% since the mid-1950s when adjusted for inflation and population growth. In Virginia, for example, 10,000 persons were recently on waiting lists for public mental health, substance abuse, or mental retardation services. Inadequacies of mental health services partly stem from the chaotic system that the United States has evolved. State Medicaid budgets fund more than half of the treatment for persons with serious mental illness, but these resources are grossly inadequate. The federal government bans the use of Medicaid funds for mental health institutions, leading to a severe shortage of beds for those who need institutionalized services to diagnose and stabilize their conditions. In many cases, local police dump persons with psychotic conditions in emergency rooms, shelters, and jails. Private health insurance companies have sharply divergent policies on funding mental health services for persons with severe conditions—but advocates succeeded in enacting the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Act of 2008 that requires health insurance companies to fund mental health services on a par with treatment for physical conditions. Incidents of violence in the nation’s secondary schools, as well as universities, have highlighted the inadequacy of mental health services in these settings in a curious mixture of over-treatment and under-treatment. Critics contend that local school districts often err when they routinely test students for mental problems—and when they encourage parents to medicate children at ever younger ages for depression, attention disorder, and hyperactivity. (Some parents have successfully filed suits against school districts alleging invasion of their children’s privacy.) These children need help from support teams in schools that attend to their medical, social, and psychological needs. The United States also needs to develop housing and services for persons on the autism spectrum after they graduate from high school. Incidents of mass violence, such as at Columbine High School in Colorado, Virginia Tech, and a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, presaged the horrible massacre of 20 children and six teachers at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. These murders were caused in each instance by a lone gunman afflicted with mental health problems. Many mass shootings occurred during the Obama presidency, including the massacre of persons at a gay bar in Orlando, Florida, that left 49 dead and 53 wounded. Obama was unable to convince the U.S. Senate to enact gun control during his presidency, including four votes on gun control measures in the wake of the Orlando massacre.Nor did Congress take action when a lone gunman killed 58 people and injured 546 people in Las Vegas on the night of October 1, 2017. Some progress has been made in cutting suicide rates among youth. Primary care physicians today are far more likely than in the past to diagnose conditions such as depression among youth and adults, as well as psychosis. Suicide rates among adolescent boys dropped significantly from the early 1990s to the present. The federal government provided $9.7 million for 14 state anti-suicide programs. Short-term patient care episodes in U.S. mental health organizations increased markedly from 1980 to the present. In 2003, a total of 2.75 million persons received federal disability payments for mental problems on the way to 3.6 million in 2013. * The ACA is probably the most important mental-health measure ever enacted in the United States because it provided insurance to roughly 24 million uninsured Americans. It provided Medicaid, including its mental health coverage, to millions of uninsured persons as its eligibility levels were markedly raised in 31 states by 2016. It slashed the cost of medications for mental health illness by one-half for Medicare enrollees. It disallowed insurance companies from denying coverage for preexisting mental health conditions. Nagging questions will not go away, however. When do mental health practitioners over-diagnose and ove-rmedicate patients? Do medications, such as recent ones developed for schizophrenia, produce worse side effects than older ones and at much greater cost? Are seemingly positive effects of medications “real” or produced by patients’ beliefs that the drugs help them? Are many of the diagnostic categories in DSM-V, scientifically validated? When is it acceptable for authorities to require specific persons to be institutionalized or to use outpatient services? If many patient advocates fear the use of excessive authority that deprives persons of their civil liberties and privacy, others contend that such persons as Seung-Hui Cho, the student at Virginia Tech who murdered students and faculty members at the university in early 2007, might not have been so destructive had a Virginia Court required him to get outpatient care in 2005. Legislation enacted in the 1960s and 1970s in many states puts strong restraints on mental health personnel who wished to commit specific patients involuntarily, yet some states like New York have recently adopted forced- treatment laws—resulting in lower incidences of suicides, homelessness, hospital stays, and attacks on others, as well as greater use of prescribed drugs. * These kinds of questions strongly suggest that mental health services must increasingly rely on evidence-based research to determine what works best and for whom. The nation’s policies and programs for people with substance abuse have been sorely flawed despite the prevalence of alcoholism and drug abuse in the United States. In the more than three decades since President Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs in 1971, the number of persons using them actually increased annually to include 2.1 million trying marijuana, 872,000 experimenting with cocaine, 108,000 trying heroin, and 2.5 million trying non-medical use of prescription drugs—with 20 million Americans currently using illicit drugs. About 30,000 persons suffered drug-induced deaths in 2005—and another 20,000 died from use of alcohol. * Twenty- nine states and the District of Columbia had enacted laws that legalized marijuana in some form by 2017. Experts differ regarding whether the nation is moving in a more positive direction in this respect, since trends vary for each of these kinds of drugs. If some studies cite declining use of illicit drugs by high school students, others argue that marked increases are occurring in the overuse of prescription drugs. If some cite closures of many methamphetamine labs and greater seizures of cocaine, others contend that the smuggling of illicit drugs from abroad has not abated. We discuss the opioid epidemic that killed as many as 60,000 people in 2016 in Chapter 13 . Even if many experts believe that treatment is more cost-effective than interdiction at borders and placing persons in jail for using illicit drugs, funding of substance abuse clinics remains inadequate. Long waits often exist in clinics that treat persons with substance abuse problems even though promising advances in drug treatment have evolved. Here, too, the ACA allowed much greater treatment of persons with substance-abuse problems by giving them private insurance as well as Medicaid. The Continuing Oppression of Aging Americans Although poverty has markedly decreased among persons over 65 due to the indexing of Social Security benefits for inflation in recent decades, about 50% of older persons retire with inadequate savings or assets. Relying mostly on their Social Security checks and Medicare, they faced an uncertain economic future. Many seniors lacked dental insurance just when they most need expensive dental procedures. If they coild not afford Medi- Gap private insurance, which covers medical care excluded from Medicare such as for chronic health conditions, they had to go through the demeaning process of “spending down” to deplete their assets so that they could qualify for the means-tested Medicaid program—meaning they had no resources for trips and cannot leave money to their children when they die. When transferring to Medicaid, however, they often changed physicians, hospitals, and health plans because large numbers of health care facilities and doctors did not serve Medicaid patients—a shift that is very disruptive to many seniors. Age discrimination in places of employment is rampant, with many companies terminating older workers just as they are on the verge of qualifying for pensions, to replace them with lower-wage younger employees or with part-time employees who receive no health care coverage or other benefits. Frail elderly persons often find it difficult to get services to help them remain at home. Medicare funds home health services only after specific episodes of hospitalization and only for relatively short periods. Medicaid funds home health care, but at such low levels that only untrained persons, often lacking even high school degrees, will provide the services. While many of these persons are highly dedicated and provide excellent care, most lack training—and a small minority can maltreat seniors and take their possessions. The burden of care for most seniors falls to their female children, relatives, and friends, who constitute a vast unpaid workforce that frequently suffers stress, health problems, and mental problems because of the enormity of their burdens. * Those elderly persons who are institutionalized often face uncertain prospects. While nursing home standards have improved, they remain inadequate in many jurisdictions not only with respect to medical care, but with respect to social work and recreational services. The United States must develop end-of-life (EOL) care that is more responsive to the needs of persons with terminal conditions. While great strides have been made in increasing hospice and palliative care programs that emphasize improving the quality of life of persons at EOL, millions of seniors miss the benefits of these programs because they are placed in them when they only have a week or less to live due to their lack of knowledge of them or the failure of their physicians to refer them to them. Many EOL persons receive excessive medical care for conditions that cannot be cured, including surgeries and chemotherapy. The states of Washington, Oregon, and Vermont have enacted legislation to allow persons with terminal health conditions to decide to terminate their lives with prescribed lethal medications from physicians under carefully controlled conditions. Very few persons have chosen to terminate their lives in these states, however, their right to self-determination has been honored. The Continuing Oppression of the LGBTQ Population Gays and lesbians still encounter virulent prejudice, as is illustrated by Justice Scalia’s scathing denunciation of the Supreme Court’s decision to invalidate Texas’s anti-sodomy law. He said the court’s majority had “largely signed onto the so-called homosexual agenda.” He contended that most Americans do not want homosexuals “as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children’s schools, or as boarders in their homes.” He viewed the decision as a precursor to laws that would legitimate gay marriage—and that would undermine laws barring bigamy, incest, and prostitution. * Shortly after the Supreme Court’s decision, some persons vowed to get a constitutional amendment enacted that would limit “marriage” to heterosexual couples. When the Supreme Court struck down this Texas law in 2003 that made homosexual acts illegal, it seemed that same-sex unions might get legal sanction in many states. Instead, the nation became polarized around this issue. Angered by the Supreme Court’s decision, conservatives vowed to seek a constitutional amendment that would limit marriage to heterosexual unions. The Catholic Church repeated its position that marriages between persons of the same sex run counter to God’s wishes—and urged parishioners to oppose same-sex civil unions or marriages. Public opinion polls suggested that the public was divided, but a small majority of Democrats and a large majority of Republicans opposed legal recognition of same-sex unions. Many of gays’ and lesbians’ battles are waged in state and local jurisdictions. By summer 2010, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Iowa had legalized gay marriage. Federal Judge Vaughn had overturned Proposition 8, which had declared gay marriage to be unconstitutional in California in November 2008. This ruling was appealed to the California Supreme Court, which began its deliberations in fall 2010. Thirty-seven states and the federal government had adopted “Defense of Marriage acts” that asserted that gay marriages in one state are invalid in others. By not having their partnerships legitimated, gay and lesbian partners could not legally share property or insurance. When one partner receives health insurance from an employer, the other partner cannot be covered under his or her policy. Unlike married heterosexual couples, one partner is not legally entitled to Social Security benefits accrued by the other partner. Nor could they legally share retirement benefits under many retirement plans. With their unions not legitimated, they lacked access to legal proceedings used by heterosexual couples to determine who gets what in the wake of dissolution of their partnerships. State laws that only allowed “civil unions” did not allow partners to quality for marriage benefits under federal law, such as Social Security and the tax code. (Federal law affects married couples in more than 1,000 ways.) While some employers offered benefits to gay and lesbian partners, many did not. While most states permit single gay and lesbian persons to adopt children, only 11 states permitted same-sex partners to adopt children jointly in 2007 even though considerable research suggests that children raised by gay or lesbian parents are not more likely to be gay than are children raised by heterosexual parents. Research also suggests they are developmentally as well adjusted or better adjusted than children raised by heterosexual parents. * Florida is the most restrictive state, not allowing adoptions by single or partnered gays and lesbians. * National civil rights legislation is needed to protect gay and lesbian rights to adopt children. President Barack Obama had pledged to end the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy established in the Clinton administration. A federal judge in Arizona declared this policy to be unconstitutional, but the president preferred federal legislation rather than a court ruling to end this policy. The military commissioned a survey to ask military personnel if they believed that gays and lesbians could openly declare their sexual orientation. Because the data indicated that most of them saw no threat to combat effectiveness, Admiral Michael Mullin and Robert Gates, secretary of defense, urged Congress in fall 2010 to enact legislation affirming the right of gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military. Obama succeeded in getting Congress to enact the Don’t Ask, Don’t Repeal Act of 2010 in the lame-duck session in late 2010. It allowed the Department of Defense to review the rescinding of “don’t ask, don’t tell” and to propose a plan of action consistent with military readiness and unit cohesion. When the Department of Defense issued this plan, “don’t ask, don’t tell” was officially ended on September 11, 2011. The nation also needs national legislation that bans hate crimes against all members of vulnerable populations, including the LGBT population. While such legislation passed the House in 2005, it was deleted from a larger anticrime bill in 2006. On June 26, 2013, the Court issued two landmark victories for gay rights, when it struck down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) that had ruled that persons in gay marriages could not receive federal benefits. It refused to overturn a lower court’s ruling that the voter-enacted ban on gay marriage in California (Proposition 8) was unconstitutional. By October 21, 2013, 14 states had legalized same-sex marriages whether by court decision (5), state legislation (6), and popular vote (3). President Obama said after the landmark rulings of the Supreme Court, “The laws of our land are catching up to the fundamental truth that millions of Americans hold in our hearts: when all Americans are treated as equal, no matter who they are or whom they love, we are all more free.”A remarkable break-through took place in 2015 when the U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges, in a 5 to 4 vote, legalized same-sex marriage through the United States and its territories and possessions. President Obama welcomed the decision saying it affirmed what millions of Americans already believed. The Continuing Oppression of Persons with Criminal Records The United States has a prison population of roughly 1.4 million persons— up from 200,000 persons in the nation’s state and federal prisons in 1970 on any given day. Another 700,000 persons are imprisoned in local jails for a grand total of 2.1 million prisoners—or four times the average per capita rate in prior decades. These increases stem partly from tougher enforcement of drug laws, as well as more severe sentencing, such as the “three strikes” policy in California that gives life sentences to offenders who have committed three crimes even if the crimes are not violent. It costs the United States about $26,650 per year to keep a person in prison. * The United States incarcerates more people and at a higher rate than any other nation in the world—2.2 million persons in 2013. * Moreover, roughly 53% of all state and federal prisoners are incarcerated for nonviolent crimes such as drug usage and petty theft. Even though they make up only 27.4% of the U.S. population, African Americans and Latinos/as constitute roughly 60% of all state and federal prisoners. The incarceration rates for African Americans and Latinos/as are, respectively, 6.6 and 2.5 times the rate for white males. As we discussed in Chapter 8 , many persons of color and significant numbers of women who are convicted of drug offenses go to jail, where they often receive little or no help for their addictions. Indeed, many persons placed in prisons for nonviolent offenses should be diverted to social service programs that address their needs and help them to improve their economic conditions. High recidivism rates exist among incarcerated adults. Not only do about one-fourth of them possess serious mental illness, but many have substance abuse problems. Prisons socialize many of them, particularly younger offenders, to crime, because they fail to provide inmates with mental health and substance abuse services, much less remedial education and job training services. Nor does the nation provide aftercare for most persons who have been released from jail. Often given a small amount of cash and placed on a bus to a nearby destination, most released prisoners are not only desperately poor, but often lack even a place to stay. Their record of imprisonment, which must often be listed on job applications in those jurisdictions that allow them not to list it, often precludes them from receiving employment. Many former inmates depend on general assistance from local counties and cities to meet their survival needs—the harshest welfare program in the United States. The more than 3 million children with an imprisoned parent—or the more than 10 million children who have had a parent in jail at some time during their youth—are forgotten victims of incarceration. A variety of community groups have reached out to this population, giving them mentoring and advocacy services, including Big Brothers Big Sisters of America as well as some faith-based groups. Realizing they may undercut the role of the imprisoned parent, these groups often try to foster prison visits with parents. But most children with imprisoned parents do not receive this assistance. After the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, annual executions rose to a high of 98 persons in 1999—and death sentences imposed on prisoners rose to 317 in 1996. Yet the introduction of DNA tests in criminal cases in the 1990s and afterward indicated that many persons had been wrongly convicted, with one advocacy group finding 200 erroneous convictions. With such evidence before him, Governor George Ryan of Illinois commuted the sentences of 171 persons in his state in 2003; John Kerry, the Democratic presidential contender in 2004, urged the abolition of death penalties on moral grounds; and New Jersey abolished them in 2007. * Eighteen states had abolished the death penalty by May 2013. In a report released during the fall of 2010, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation offered its positive and sunny outlook on the status of the state’s correctional system. Touting a “smart-on-crime” approach, the department proclaimed that strategic policies, such as closer monitoring of serious and violent parolees, allowed for a more efficient deployment of resources. “By safely lowering our prison population, we save money while keeping our prisons and our streets safe,” it stated. * The report went on to identify a number of departmental accomplishments, for example the opening of a women’s trauma-informed substance abuse program, construction of two brand-new mental health facilities, and the launch of an upgraded database that aims to facilitate coordination among various law enforcement agencies. The U.S. Supreme Court cast a far more critical eye on California’s corrections system in May 2011, however, when it directed the state to address its severe prison overcrowding by releasing tens of thousands of inmates. In a 5–4 ruling, the Court ordered the state to maintain a prison population of no more than 110,000 inmates, meaning that California will need to shed its current numbers by 33,000. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy explained, “A prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society” ( Brown v. Plata , No. 09-1233). Due to the Supreme Court decision, California was forced to reevaluate a “tough-on-crime” policy that had placed so many inmates into an increasingly congested criminal justice system. It began to parole thousands of inmates in 2011—and had released 27,500 of them within 15 months. Researchers had concluded by 2016 that the release of these inmates had not increased crime rates in the state even though recidivism rates did not decline. On the national level, 19 states are operating above maximum capacity, with at least seven at 25% overcapacity. Social workers lobbied the state legislature and the governor in 2013 to give prisoners mental health, job training, substance abuse counseling, and education to allow many nonviolent offenders to avoid or shorten detention. A national coalition of liberal and conservative persons and groups convened in 2016 to seek policy changes that might reduce the number of prisoners in federal jails. Revisiting the Terms Outgroups and V ulnerable Populations Even our brief discussion suggests that the terms vulnerable population and outgroup and oppressed populations describe many stigmatized groups in American society even though there has been progress for some or many members of them during the last 40 years. We will know that the term is outmoded for a specific population when its members perceive themselves to be part of the social and economic mainstream of society. The United States has gone through specific stages. Small gains were achieved in the decades and centuries prior to the 1960s due to the determined work of advocates and group empowerment strategies that we have discussed in prior chapters. Civil rights legislation was enacted principally in the 1960s and 1970s, although some important measures were enacted more recently. From the 1970s onward, reformers worked to prevent the erosion of these civil rights by conservative presidents and jurists. Notable gains for the LGBTQ population took place in the Obama presidency. We now realize that these populations require far more than formal rights. Single heads of household need child care, subsidized transportation, and free health care, not to mention job training and education subsidies. Disabled persons need home health aides, affordable and disability-friendly housing, and special accommodations at work. Persons of color need innovative schools, outreach public health programs, subsidized transportation to suburban places of employment, and access to job training. Released prisoners need help in finding jobs and making the transition to living in communities. Women need protections from sexual harassment and from discrimination in employment. These amenities need to be prioritized in budgets of local, state, and federal governments. It is true that leaders and members of these oppressed populations achieved signal successes by using various empowerment strategies. They developed social movements such as the African American civil rights movement, the feminist movement, and the gay rights movement. They contested negative policies in the courts. * They developed voting constituencies that elected public officials sympathetic to their needs. They developed coalitions with other groups. They lobbied legislatures. They designed self-help projects to allow members of their groups to start businesses, get educated, and improve neighborhoods. They used churches, synagogues, and mosques to provide supportive networks. They surmounted stigmatization by identifying and developing cultures that affirmed the dignity of their groups, such as black pride, gay awareness, and feminist ideology. Evaluate Barack Obama’s Presidency President Obama moved the nation in a liberal direction in summer 2010 when Congress enacted the ACA and bank regulations after it had earlier passed the Stimulus Plan. When taken together, Obama’s social and economic initiatives were startling in their sheer size. Only one year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the federal government accounted for a larger share of the nation’s economy—26%— than at any time since World War II. It financed 9 of 10 mortgages in the United States when the roles of huge mortgage companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are considered. It owned 60% of General Motors and shifted much of Chrysler’s ownership to Fiat. It financed the debt of most Americans who used credit cards and took out car loans due to its vast role in financing banks and lenders. It owned 80% of AIG. We have discussed the sheer size of the Stimulus Plan earlier in this chapter. We have discussed how President Obama and his allies enacted the ACA that provided insurance and improved health care for tens of millions of Americans when we include its preventive care, insurance exchanges, Medicaid expansion, policies that required private insurance companies to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions and to include basic coverage, and that covered women’s reproductive medicine. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank banking regulations set in place policies intended to prevent another Great Recession. He developed policies to avert climate change over the objections not only of some corporations but people who believed climate change had not been proven even though more than 95% of scientists argued that the data were definitive. He funded tens of millions of dollars of insulating homes and factories with the Stimulus Plan. He led the way to the Paris Accord that was signed by 195 nations to mitigate global warming and where each nation determines its own contribution by setting and meeting targets. The nations agreed to hold the global average temperature to less than 2 degrees LO 12-12 centigrade above preindustrial levels and to limit increase to 1.5 degrees centigrade above preindustrial levels. He became a strong advocate for LGBTQ rights in the military and in civil society. He worked for voting rights for African Americans. Obama cut the deficit created by the loss of government taxes during the Great Recession. He cut American military engagements abroad by ending the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War. He began military operations to push ISIS out of Iraq and to curtail its operations, as well as the Taliban and Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan and elsewhere. He failed to end the civil war in Syria. Obama built a solid Democratic base in presidential elections that included persons of color, a near majority of women, highly educated people, and millennial persons. While he won landslide victories in 2008 and 2012, he could not orchestrate Democratic victories in 2010 and 2014 when Republicans won landslide victories not only in the Congress but governorships and state legislatures. Nor did he have a strong economic message that reduced inequality, while declaring it to be one of the nation’s top four problems in his last speech as president. He had a unique style, sometimes called “cool.” While subject to hard- hitting attacks by political foes, he maintained an unflappable and dignified demeanor. He seldom made personal attacks. No scandals occurred during his presidency. He was highly respected by world leaders. More liberal than former president Bill Clinton, he changed the policy language of his era in important ways. “Government” was no longer a negative term to many people. Fewer people deified private markets. Regulations were increasingly viewed as necessities. Few experts guessed that a president who followed him would work to destroy his legacy. In 2017, Donald Trump terminated many regulations established by President Obama. He was unable, however, to repeal and replace the ACA and many of the bank regulations established by Obama. The Congressional elections of 2018 and the Congressional and presidential election of 2020 would determine which president would prevail in the longer term, as we discuss in Chapter 13 . Why Obama Couldn’t Sustain the Nation’ s Liberal Direction Most experts believed in 2015 that Hillary Clinton would become the Democratic nominee for the presidency. They were confident that she would defeat the Republicans’ nominee in the presidential election after she had been nominated. I discuss in the next chapter how Donald Trump defeated Clinton in November 2016 to become the nation’s next president. With hindsight, we can see some warning signs for Democrats. Barack Obama won landslide victories in 2008 and 2012 with a broad coalition of persons of color, intellectuals, college-educated people, and women. But he lost landslide elections when he was not at the top of the ballot in so-called “off-year elections” in 2010 and 2014 when Republicans won many governorships and state legislatures and the U.S. House of Representatives. In these off-year defeats, many Democrats failed to vote including single mothers, persons of color, younger voters, and blue-collar whites unlike many Republicans including evangelical voters, significant numbers of suburban voters, members of the Tea Party, and Southerners. These off-year elections should have been a warning sign for Democrats because they indicated that the Democratic Party and its president often failed to rally its members. As I discuss in the next chapter , Donald Trump capitalized on these weaknesses to deliver a stunning defeat for Democrats in 2016. We ask the same question we posed about President Obama about Donald Trump, but in reverse. If Obama could not usher in a new liberal period, can Trump usher in a continuation of the mostly conservative era that began with Ronald Reagan’s presidency and extended into the presidency of Donald Trump?

Bush. He would help “the people.” He would overthrow “political elites” in both major parties, such as Jeb Bush (brother of President George W. Bush) and Hillary Clinton (wife of President Bill Clinton). He would attack purveyors of “false information” such as the mass media. He would find ways to “ban immigrants” who would threaten the safety of the people and take their jobs, such as Muslims and other immigrants, such as those who came across the Mexican border. He would “drain the swamp” by attacking 2017 Trump’s ﬁring of FBI Director James Comey and his replacement by Robert Mueller 2017 Hurricanes Harvey , Irma, and Maria hit the coasts , cities, and towns of Texas , Louisiana , Puerto Rico, Florida , Georgia , South Carolina , and North Carolina 2017 Trump’s budget and tax proposals in his ﬁrst 11 months 2017 Trump’s trade , infrastructure policies 2017 Trump’s climate policies 2017 Trump’s response to mass shootings 2017 The rise of awareness and prosecution of sexual harassment of women 2017 The impact of personal scandals on the Trump presidency corruption in Washington, D.C., such as former legislators who became lobbyists for large corporations—or large donors who sought special favors after giving campaign contributions to politicians. He would cut American troop numbers in the Middle East that had, he said, wasted trillions of dollars trying to “make other countries like us.” He would reform trade treaties that, he contended, caused tens of thousands of American corporations to move their operations abroad. He would withdraw from international bodies as “a nationalist” and advocate of “America First.” He would personally deliver benefits to the people better than any other prior president, often saying I will build the Wall and I will have so many (legislative) successes that “you will get tired of seeing them.” * Trump appeared to have no ideology, such as the conservatism of Ronald Reagan and the liberalism of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. While his supporters often were blue-collar white voters in rural and semirural areas, he referred to them as “the people,” as well as anyone else who supported him. He took his messages directly to “the people” with Tweets. He ran revivalist-like rallies of his supporters. He generated non- stop coverage from the mass media even as he mostly labeled it as “false media.” We try to peek below these surface arguments, positions, and rallies to ask a simple question. What can we learn about Trump not from his rhetoric, his Tweets, and his many quarrels with others, but from his policy actions . Do his actions suggest the he veers toward liberal, moderate, or conservative positions? Has he and does he support policies that further the interests of his base of support, i.e., white blue-collar persons in coal country and in the many towns and cities where manufacturing plants left their workers in limbo when they exited the United States for other nations? It is challenging to identify the “real” Trump because he frequently diverts attention away from his policy choices. He engages in culture wars by attacking immigrants, a Latino judge, a Muslim parent whose son was killed in the Middle East when serving in the U.S. armed forces, the leaders of Puerto Rico, and African American college basketball players who were temporarily jailed in China. Or he bullies members of his own party or the opposing party. Or he fires the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and attacks the person who succeeded him. Or he provocatively defends dictators of Russia and the Philippines. Or he attacks the mass media as false news even as they issue meticulous findings based on time- honored investigative techniques. It is important to examine the specific policies that he favored because he made specific policy promises to white blue-collar persons during the campaign and during his early presidency. We will ask whether he honored these promises. Or whether he betrayed his base of support by not honoring them. We can also ask whether his actions were congruent with widely held ethical standards, such as one in National Association of Social Work (NASW) Code of Ethics. Did he help vulnerable populations? Was he a deeply prejudiced man? Did he seek to decrease extreme economic inequality in the United States? Did he try to avert climate change? Or did he favor policies that would enrich affluent persons? We can also ask whether President Trump made his decisions only after he had examined whether they were meritorious on ethical and empirical grounds. As we ask these questions, we can decide whether he was true to his promises or whether he betrayed the population that elected him. More than any president in recent American history, Trump was the subject of numerous investigations that swirled around him—investigations that included possible collusion by his campaign with the Russians during his presidential race against Hillary Clinton, possible use of his office for financial gain, possible obstruction of justice by himself and his campaign, and possible sexual harassment by him prior to running for the presidency. Did the sheer number of investigations divert him from the work of his presidency? Trump Controversy: What Is T rue and What Is False? EP 1a Considerable debate has taken place about when it is fair to criticize the actions and words of Donald Trump. Donald Trump and his allies often contend that the media, Democrats, and liberals often rely on “false facts.” It is true: people on the right, center, and the left live in different bubbles. They get their news from different media such as from FOX NEWS on the right and CNN, MSNBC, and the New York Times on the left. They often live in conservative or liberal neighborhoods. They develop friends respectively on the left, middle, or right. They seldom communicate with people with different views. Yet “evidence,” “facts,” and “ethical values” do exist. Scientists, government officials, and experts collect information about the nation. The impact of specific policies can often be measured. Evidence-based practice does exist in social work, medicine, and other professions. First ethical principles do exist, including honesty, freedom to hold personal opinions, self-determination, confidence keeping, due process, fairness, and social justice as I discussed in Chapters 1 and 2 . It isn’t ethical to bully other people or to attack members of vulnerable populations because of their ethnicity, race, or gender. It isn’t ethical to champion the wealth of highly affluent people and corporations while neglecting the status and needs of persons in lower economic echelons. Differences exist about the merit of specific findings from empirical research, as well as our ethical reasoning in LO 13-1 specific situations. These differences ought not imply, however, that well- accepted standards for seeking empirical and ethical truth do not exist, nor do they suggest that the mass media cannot engage in investigative reporting based on facts as witnessed by many instances when reporters expose wrongdoings by public officials, as well as meritorious actions. I have criticized prior presidents, groups, and persons in this book in prior historical eras in both conservative and liberal camps for violating first ethical principles and not using evidence-based research. I criticized Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson for subscribing to stereotypes of African Americans. I criticized President Franklin Roosevelt for placing tens of thousands of Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II. I argued that President Lyndon Johnson falsely claimed that North Vietnam had attacked American naval vessels at the Bay of Tonkin to manipulate the United States into the Vietnam War. I argued that President Clinton’s welfare reform in 1996 was unduly harsh on low- income persons and immigrants. I contended that President George W. Bush falsely claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction to manipulate the United States into invading Iraq. I criticize President Barack Obama for insufficiently publicizing the major accomplishment of the Stimulus Program and for not discussing poverty sufficiently. Yet I have praised many prior presidents, groups, and persons in prior eras, such as when they enacted meritorious social policies that I present in “Policy Scorecards” at the ends of each chapter. I use this same approach to analyze the Trump Presidency. I identify some successes during the first nine months of his presidency such as correctly identifying the major social problems encountered by white blue-collar people in rural and semirural areas, seeking to revise trade treaties that discriminate against the United States, and questioning the extent to which the United States spent resources on the War in Iraq. I also criticize his violation of ethical principles such as telling the truth. I also criticize his racism, misogyny, and prejudice against Muslims, immigrants, and disabled persons. I also criticize his failure to use and honor evidence-based research in social policy and with respect to climate change. Exercise your ethical right to free speech and thought as you read this chapter. Review the discussion of ethical reasoning and first ethical positions in Chapter 2 as a starting point. Refer, too, to the Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers at NASW Code of Ethics which is discussed in Chapters 1 and 2 . It begins with this sentence: “The primary mission of the social work profession is to enhance human well- being and help meet the basic needs of all people, with particular attention to the needs and empowerment of people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty… fundamental to social work is attention to the environmental forces that create, contribute to, and address problems in living” (see the NASW Code of Ethics at socialworkers.org ). Also refer to scientific findings like ones that demonstrate that impoverished persons, regardless of their race, develop social problems partly because of their economic status. T rump’s Early Life Born in 1946, Trump is part of the huge generation of so-called baby boomer born in the wake of World War II. * Frederick Trump, his grandfather, was a German immigrant who came to the U.S. penniless, but who managed to obtain considerable wealth prior to his death in 1918. In Seattle and Alaska, he established boarding houses complete with prostitutes. He used the profits from these ventures to purchase real estate in Queens where he astutely gained assistance from local politicians for zoning and other concessions. He bequeathed these properties to Fred Trump, Donald Trump’s father. Fred built a substantial real estate empire in the Queens section of New York City with more than 27,000 apartments. He also built barracks and apartments for members of the U.S. Navy along the East Coast. It was a tough-love family bonded around Fred’s real estate and work ethic. Fred taught his son to be “ruthlessly competitive and aggressive”. * His mother was a sickly person who was so enamored with money that she would regularly inspect washing machines in the apartments to find coins. Donald was a hard-to-control child in public school, often fighting with other children and even hitting a teacher in the face in the fifth grade. Fred sent Donald to military school to decrease his combative tendencies. Trump, Jr. contended that the teachers in the military school “smacked the hell out of you” if you disobeyed. He resonated to the discipline and structure, as well as a specific teacher who became his mentor. He was an average student who excelled at athletics. * Trump spent two years at Fordham University prior to transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he received a bachelor’s degree in economics at the Wharton School. While at both institutions, he devoted weekends and many evenings working for his father in his real estate operations. LO 13-2 Fred developed his initial wealth in the years following World War II when a huge housing shortage existed as soldiers returned home. The federal government funded a housing boom in the war’s wake by lending billions of dollars to persons who purchased housing—and by expending huge resources on infrastructure including roads and bridges. Fred learned how to tap into these resources as he constructed hundreds of apartments. Fred became sufficiently successful that he built a mansion in an affluent part of Queens. * Donald became Fred’s business associate from high school onward, working weekends and summers to collect rents, oversee repairs, and learn the nuts and bolts of real estate. He learned how to make deals. He learned how to negotiate with business partners. He knew how to gain advantages over competitors. He learned how to get local politicians to grant zoning and tax concessions—and how to get them to condemn land so that he could purchase it at sufficiently low prices to build on it. He learned how to make payoffs to politicians to gain these concessions. He learned how to live on credit from banks and government programs—using rent from tenants to finance yet additional loans to construct or purchase new properties. He learned how his father was highly leveraged, i.e., was cash- poor because he relied on borrowed resources to purchase real estate, using his property as collateral to purchase additional real estate. Trump lived in a mostly white environment in his youth and at his military school. People who worked in the Trump businesses were mostly white. How would he respond to the more diverse world of national politics, still decades away? How would he respond to a black president, still decades away? What about African Americans, Latinos, women, Muslims, and immigrants? The first hint of racism occurred when Fred was charged by the U.S. Justice Department of discrimination against African American tenants in the 1970s. * , * Donald Trump was deeply influenced by Roy Cohn, an attorney who worked with Fred Trump on the law suits that accused him of discrimination in the leasing of their apartments. Cohn persuaded Donald by example and persuasion to be confrontive, to never give ground, and to double down against assailants. Trump adopted this style to a remarkable degree—clearly displaying it many decades later in this campaign for presidency and during his presidency. * There was a dark side to real estate dealings of his grandfather and father. Both of them often operated at the edges of the law. His father was accused of using Federal Housing Authority (FHA) loans, meant to benefit veterans, to help non-veterans. His father was accused and convicted for discriminating against African Americans, often denying them units. After extensive court proceedings, he was charged with discrimination and made to pay extensive fines, but Fred never admitted guilt, even bragging that he had won the case. They had other run-ins with the law. This tradition continued throughout Donald’s career when he engaged in thousands of lawsuits, routinely countersuing when tenants, business partners, and others sued him. * Fred prospered in this post-war period as well as the 1960s and 1970s. Armed with his father’s real estate skills and with the resources he inherited, Donald prospered in the “Second Gilded Age” of the 1980s. Recall that the First Gilded Age took place in the decades following the Civil War in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s when the United States industrialized and urbanized at a rate never seen before in other nations. The first Gilded Age was dominated by titans of industry and finance such as John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie (on the one hand) and tens of millions of penniless immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico and Asia (on the other hand). The Second Gilded Age, which began in the early 1980s, was led by CEOs of major corporations and start-up firms whose executives brought home $25 million and more in annual pay, stock options, and huge severance packages. They benefited from President Ronald Reagan’s decision to cut top marginal tax rates from 70% to 28% and to cut inheritance taxes, and to increase tax loopholes. The nation became enraptured by a culture of wealth. * Turning age 35 at the start of this Second Gilded Age, Donald moved his real estate beyond the working class areas of Queens and Brooklyn to Manhattan which was the heart of New York City’s financial community, press, and mass media. He increasingly chose to deviate from his father’s reliance on apartment buildings to constructing or purchasing huge buildings that contained high-priced condominiums and office space. Many of them were embellished with large gold-tinted letters that spelled TRUMP. * Unlike his grandfather and father, who kept low profiles, Donald came to seek “fame” to a remarkable degree in his 30s. He got on talk shows. He made outrageous statements to get media attention. He defamed other celebrities to get media coverage. He bragged about his buildings and his wealth. He conspicuously parked an airplane that could carry 120 passengers at La Guardia airport though he outfitted it only with 40 seats, each with gold seat buckles. He got extensive coverage for his many romances when he was an eligible bachelor. He received coverage for each of his three marriages—and for his break-ups with two wives. His reality TV show, The Apprentice , was watched by tens of millions of viewers at its peak. He was featured on covers of scores of magazines that he proudly displays in his office. He had popularity levels just behind the popularity of sitting and former presidents in the 1980s and 1990s in New York. * He received considerable publicity, too, for his aggressive business strategies. Not content merely with real estate, he entered the casino business in Atlantic City in New Jersey. He liked casinos partly because they attracted customers who were reliable customers because many of them were addicted to gambling and favored local casinos rather than distant ones in Los Vegas. But Trump underestimated their costs and overestimated their likely revenues as competing casinos were built. When he could not finance the loans he had obtained from a consortium of banks to build his casinos, he was at their mercy because they had the power to force him to liquidate many or all of his other real estate holdings to repay his debts to the banks. Representatives of many lending institutions met in Atlantic City to decide how to deal with Trump. * Mercifully for him, they decided it was better to get pennies on the dollar than to drive him into bankruptcy, partly because they had outstanding loans with Trump for many of his other properties. They made him liquidate his casino business in Atlantic City. * He was also bruised by another business venture known as “Trump University” that enticed many people to pay large sums for courses in real estate that would ostensibly be taught by highly successful business people with possible lectures from Trump himself. After enrollees discovered that successful real estate investors did not teach their courses, they sued Trump for false advertising. A judge required Trump to reimburse former students in 2016. * Trump emerged from these ventures with considerable wealth and fame. He was a billionaire even if no one knew his precise wealth because no outsiders saw his tax returns—not even voters even after he promised access to them during his campaign. He increasingly did not own buildings, but sold licenses to their owners so they could put TRUMP in gold letters on them and advertise them with that name in many locations in the United States and abroad. He benefited from his growing fame in many ways: it made banks and local politicians more likely to give him loans and favors, induced the media to pay even more attention to him, persuaded purchasers of his real estate to buy his properties, and made city officials and others less likely to attack or sue him. * Trump gave no indication in his youth and early years and midlife that he would veer from relatively conservative views. His grandfather and parents had little engagement in civil affairs. They gave little money to charity. They did not engage in politics other than to contribute to candidates from both parties to gain their favor. Trump’s foundation was dissolved in 2016 when New York state regulators declared it to be fraudulent. Trump’s association with officials and business people in the former Soviet Union began in the 1970s and the early and mid 1980s. * Trump described how Soviet officials were interested in co-funding a joint project to construct a hotel in Moscow. He flew to Moscow for the first time in 1987 to discuss a deal. No deal was struck on this trip or many subsequent trips to Moscow. But connections were made—and Trump was the kind of Westerner that the Soviets hoped to cultivate. Trump admitted that the first trip raised his own horizons—possibly running for president. Early Preparation for a Run for Politics His fame in the 1980s accentuated his desire to run for the presidency at some future point. Why not, he wondered, obtain this pinnacle of success as his growing fame extended beyond New York City to the nation with the Apprentice ? Would not his growing fame increase his odds of receiving the nomination and gaining votes? He engaged in a “fake or pretend campaign” in 2000 when Democrat Al Gore competed with Republican George W. Bush for the presidency in the wake of Bill Clinton’s two-term presidency. Why not, he wondered, run to be the presidential nominee of a third party called the Reform Party, but with no intention of staying in the race to its final conclusion. It was a foregone conclusion that Pat Buchanan, a former Nixon aide, would receive its nomination, but running in this campaign would give him a taste of politics that might prepare him for a serious campaign sometime later. He also earned considerable money from this endeavor by giving numerous “business seminars” that each brought him $100,000. * We can’t understand the campaign of 2000 without placing it in the context of the 1960s and early 1970s. Recall that Richard Nixon, with the help of Pat Buchanan, hoped to entice white blue-collar voters from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in presidential elections of 1968 and 1972. Many of them disliked the enactment of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, as well as school bussing and affirmative action that came soon after. Buchanan invented the term, “the silent majority,” to describe these alienated white persons in the North and the South. Nixon attracted some of them to the Republican Party, but many remained Democrats. * Fast forward to 2000 when Buchanan wanted to attract them to a third party that he expected to head. Buchanan held rallies where he attacked the political establishment in the style that Trump came to employ. He blamed LO 13-3 immigrants in his book, Suicide of a Superpower , that was published in 2011. He wrote: “Mexico is moving north… Will this Mexican nation … advance the goals of the Constitution—to insure domestic tranquility… Or has our passivity in the face of this invasion imperiled our union?” He added, “Half a century after Martin Luther King envisioned a day when his children would be judged ‘not by the color of their skin, but the content of their character,’ Journalists of color are demanding the hiring and promotion of journalists based on the color of their skin. Jim Crow is back. Only the color of the beneficiaries and the color of the victims have been reversed.” He continued, “Americans who seek stricter immigration control have been charged with many social sins: racism, xenophobia, nativism … What motivates people who insist that America’s doors be held wide open until the European majority disappears?” He pleaded for a “White Party” that increases “the GOP share of the white Christian vote” … “by specific appeals to social, cultural, and moral issues, and for equal justice for the emerging white minority…” * Trump emerged from this fake campaign of 2000 with a platform that he could use and update for the presidential campaign of 2015 and 2016. Like Buchanan, he identified alienated white voters in rural areas, coal country, and distressed rural towns and cities to be his core constituency. Their alienation partly stemmed from the migration of thousands of manufacturing companies in their communities to developing nations like Mexico, Vietnam, and Cambodia, and elsewhere. Many of them also lost their work in coal mines as the worldwide demand for coal decreased, replaced by other kinds of energy, such as from natural gas, solar panels, and wind turbines. * He also wooed white professionals who resonated to his populist campaign. His crusade would be studded with racism, sexism, and xenophobia just like Nixon’s and Buchanan’s. He pledged to restore America’s infrastructure, to stop the movement of “Mexicans” northward, and to restore Christianity to its rightful position by appealing to evangelicals. He pledged to cut military engagements in the Middle East as he contended the United States had spent trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan with no victory—and to use these resources to repair the nation’s infrastructure. He added other themes, such as terminating trade treaties to keep companies from exiting from the United States. He opposed climate control policies that decreased jobs, he argued, by outlawing the use of coal and other fossil fuels while siding with people who contended that scientific study of climate change is bogus. From Fantasy to Reality Trump entered the political fray when he created the “Birther Movement” that contended that President Obama did not have the right to be president because he (allegedly) had not been born in the United States as required by the U.S. Constitution. Even when President Obama produced a legal birth certificate in 2011 that showed that he had been born in a hospital in Honolulu, Trump continued to claim he had not been born in the United States, only finally conceding that he had been born in the United States in 2016. * Trump was irritated when President Obama ridiculed him at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner in 2011. Irritated by his leadership of the Birther campaign, President Obama used the occasion to lampoon him by saying “I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate to rest, and that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter, like did we fake the moon landing?” * But Trump probably would have run in 2016 anyway because, at age 70, he was running out of time. Trump had both political liabilities and assets as he considered running for the presidency in 2015. Aside from his fake campaign in 2000, he had never been a political candidate or held political office. He had changed political party affiliation at least five times since the 1980s, including registering as a Republican in 1987, shifting to the Independence Party in 1999, running for the Reform Party’s presidential nomination in 2000, joining the Democratic Party in 2001, returning to the Republican Party in 2009, selecting no party when he voted in 2011, and returning to the Republican Party in 2012 to which he still belonged in 2015 when he announced he would run for office. * Even when he ran for the nomination of the Republican Party in 2015, he said he might run as an independent if he believed he was not treated fairly by party officials—only to remain in the Party once he received its LO 13-4 nomination. He boasted about his large donations to candidates from both major parties over the years. Tactics during the Presidential Campaign of 2016 EP 1b EP 3b Trump had a “toolbox” of tactics that he used during campaign rallies and during his debates with other presidential contenders. While these tactics are used by other politicians, Trump used many of them to an unprecedented degree. LO 13-5 Selling His Brand Trump had spent decades in the real estate industry where he bought and sold buildings and land. He publicized his real estate luxury holdings incessantly through the mass media. He publicized himself relentlessly as he became addicted by fame and success. When he campaigned for the president and became president, he marketed himself-as-politician as his brand just as he had marketed his real estate. All of the tools in his toolbox that we now discuss can be viewed both as self-defining attributes as well as tactics to market himself-as-politician. His self-image and his desired public image included each of the descriptors described below. He viewed many others as competitors who would question or contest his brand, including those traits, behaviors, and values that he defined as his brand. Some of these desired traits, behaviors, and values are not desirable to many other people, but are viewed as desirable by Trump, such as prejudice against at-risk populations, bullying, doubling down, fudging the truth, and seeking publicity for divorces and affairs. He was alternately or simultaneously paranoid, insecure, and narcissistic as he sought to protect his brand. His biographers, who I cite subsequently, document how his brand, and his defense of it, remained relatively unchanging over his life span from the 1980s onward. Manipulating the Media We have already discussed Trump’s manipulation of the media before 2015. He became addicted to fame—and relied heavily on the media to get it. This addiction led to his reliance upon the media to become president and to outmaneuver opponents and to retain his popularity as president. He welcomed and incited controversy, using it to draw attention to himself. He attacked the media mercilessly in his rallies, pointing his finger at television camera operators as he lambasted the evil media so mercilessly that media reporters and staff feared for their safety. He sought interviews at strategic points. He used the media to divert attention from scandals such as the investigation into collusion with the Russians, obstruction of justice, insinuations that had conflicts of interest, and controversies about his family members. He used nonstop tweets to get media attention. He watched cable news for hours almost every day. He sent sample headlines to news officials hoping they would use them. He bullied people partly to get media attention. Intimidation and Bullying During his career in real estate, he frequently intimidated others when negotiating with them, such as threatening them, bullying them, and stating that he might withdraw from negotiations with them. It is not surprising, then, that he often resorted to intimidation when he became a politician. He often intimidated Republican party officials with the threat that he would start a third party. His rapid ascent in the polls in 2015 made party leaders fear that he might undermine it by enticing many voters to vote for a third party as polls even in 2015 suggested he had relatively high popularity rates. Figure 13.1. Michael Candelori/Alamy Stock Photo President Trump’s celebration of his first 100 days in August 2016 at Harrisburg, Pa. Trump frequently resorted to bullying during debates with other Republicans and later with Hillary Clinton. Bullies seek to force others to do what they want not through rational persuasion, but by using superior strength, threats, and strong-arm tactics.. Trump admitted in televised interviews that he resorted to bullying in his youth, even engaging in physical conflict with others. His father sent him to military school partly to curtail these tendencies. Bullying actions included giving opponents negative nicknames such as “lying Ted Cruz,” “little Marco Rubio,” low- energy Jeb Bush,” and “crooked Hillary .” He called his opponents “elitists.” He threatened to prosecute and imprison Hillary Clinton. He enticed four women who he alleged had been sexually attacked by her husband, Bill Clinton, to take prominent seats at one of his debates. He sought to intimidate reporters to give favorable coverage to his campaign by describing them as “the evil (or fake) media” at the beginning of his rallies. Yet bullying and intimidation can be viewed as unethical because they discourage rational discourse. They sometimes backfired when persons who were bullied turned against Trump. Hyperbole and L ying Trump engaged in hyperbole when he exaggerated his achievements. He claimed, for example, that he had won a one-sided victory over Clinton when, in fact, she obtained 3 million more votes than himself. He argued widespread voter fraud when he claimed that millions of Clinton’s votes were fraudulent when state election officials only found a few fraudulent votes in swing states like Wisconsin. Nor did Trump dispute that he engaged in “creative hyperbole” on many occasions, including estimates of his wealth. He often promised his supporters that he would “build the wall,” repeal and replace Obamacare, reform trade treaties, and create millions of new jobs almost instantly after he became president—even when none of these promises had come true by December, 2017. He also lied on many occasions as revealed by PolitiFact and other fact- checking sources that kept count of his lies during the campaign, his presidential debates, and his presidency—with numbers often totaling in the hundreds during each of these periods. (PolitiFact awarded Trump the 2015 Lie of the Year Award declaring 21% of his statements to be mostly false, 33% to be false, and 15% to be “pants on fire.” * The Washington Post counted more than 1,000 “lies and misleading “statements” by Trump during his first seven months in office. * If exaggeration is used to magnify true events beyond their actual size or importance, lies are factually erroneous statements that are meant to deceive. Some were relatively minor lies, such as saying leaders of the Boy Scouts had praised his speech to their convention when, in fact, they had not contacted him, much less praised him—or that more people had attended his inauguration than Barack Obama when, in fact, many more people had attended Obama’s inauguration. Other lies were more serious, such as his contention that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided no or few benefits to enrollees when, in fact, it gave health insurance to more than 20 million people. Some statements fell between exaggeration and lying, such as Trump’s contention that the ACA caused sharp increases in insurance premiums for millions of people when, in fact, increases in premiums were often more modest or caused by other factors. Trump often made promises about himself and his likely accomplishments that were not true. He convinced large number of evangelicals that he was a man of the bible when he rarely attended church. He bragged about the policy successes he would have if he became president—so many, he said, the his voters would become tired at their sheer number when he had only modest policy victories by early December 2017. He argued that he had assurances from the President of Mexico that Mexico would fund the Wall across its Northern border when the President had not made this promise. He promised he would not cut funding of Medicaid or leave people without health insurance, but supported legislative measures that proposed deep cuts in Medicaid and would have moved as many as 23 million persons from health insurance. He promised not to defund Planned Parenthood only to change this position. He did not follow through on many of his promises to his base of white blue-collar voters, not even initiating planned improvements by early 2018 in the nation’s infrastructure that would, he said, provide them with jobs. Diversion and Distraction Trump was skilled at changing the subject when he was under attack. He would focus upon a new controversy to escape a prior one. He relied heavily on the media to change the subject. When he was experiencing difficulty getting the House and the Senate to repeal and replace the ACA, for example, he focused on threats to the United States from Kim Jong-un, the Korean leader who was threatening to attack the United States with nuclear missiles. He facilitated diversion by taking new controversial positions periodically, such as coming to the defense of persons who wanted to preserve statues of Civil War generals when investigations of him and his campaign for collusion with Russians had gathered steam. Not Using Evidence-Based Findings Trump often ignored scientific evidence. He ar gued that climate change had not been proved, even though more than 97% of climate scientists provided strong evidence. He overstated the extent immigrants engage in crimes— and overstated the extent his policies had been responsible for decreasing immigration to the United States when, in fact, immigration across the Southern border of the United States had already greatly diminished during and after the Great Recession. Trump’s dislike of science is troubling for many reasons. Were it not for science, people would not have cars, TVs, mobile phones, computers, railroads, sufficient food, medications, anesthetics, medical screening devices, and many other conveniences and necessities. Social workers would not seek and obtain evidence-based findings that would improve their professional practice. Many innovations in medicine would not have occurred such as inventions of medications, X- ray machines, and vaccinations. Creating Divisions and Enemies Trump often sought to create divisions between political parties, ethnic and racial groups, specific persons, and nations to the extent that he rarely used words like “unite” or “work together.” He created divisions between the two parties by calling Democrats derogatory names, such as calling Chuck Shumer, the Democratic Minority Leader in the Senate, a clown. He rallied white blue-collar voters by arguing that immigrants took their jobs even though many experts have contended that they mostly take jobs that white American would not fill, such as harvesting vegetables and fruit. He created divisions between the United States and its neighbors to the North (Canada) and South (Mexico) by implying that they took advantage of the United States through the North American Treaty Organization (NAFTA). He portrayed himself as coming to the defense of wronged people and a wronged nation. Sometimes politicians should create divisions, such as when other nations do take advantage of the United States, but this tactic, carried to excess, can preclude collaboration needed to solve problems. He contended that the “fake media,” that included all the major TV channels and many newspapers, attacked him unfairly, even when many of their stories were accurately sourced. Appealing to the Base All politicians “preach to the base,” such as when Republicans seek tax cuts for relatively affluent Americans and when Democrats seek civil rights legislation for persons of color and other at-risk populations. Few of them cultivate their base as assiduously as President Trump. Going back to his campaign for the presidency in 2000 for the Reform Party, Trump selected white blue-collar Americans as the base of his support. They liked his aggressive campaign style. They believed he would address their economic needs if he were elected. They liked his attacks against “elites” in both Republican and Democratic Parties. Millions of them came to trust Trump, a billionaire who had virtually no prior record in supporting social policies that would help low- and moderate-income Americans. He selected issues that appealed to many of them, such as revising trade treaties, cutting off immigration from Muslim nations and from Mexico, and enhancing the coal mining industry. He promised he would not cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security while also improving medical care for ill effects from consuming pain-killing drugs such as opioids. Above all, he stated or implied that he would improve their economic status by providing them with more jobs. It is not surprising, then, that white blue-collar voters turned out in record numbers not only across the nation, but in states with large number of electoral votes such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, and Wisconsin. Shifting Blame Once he became president, he soon discovered that Republicans were unable to translate his campaign promises into policy successes as we discuss subsequently during his first year in office. He used the tactic of “shifting blame” to deflect anger from his base of support from himself. He could not repeal and replace Obamacare. He could not revise trade treaties. He did not develop a program to repair the nation’s infrastructure. He could not ban immigrants from Muslim nations—or build the wall on the Southern border. So he blamed others for these defeats, such as fellow Republicans, the press, Democrats, foreign leaders, and members of his Cabinet. He fired many members of his presidential staff. He fired James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He attacked Hillary Clinton long after he defeated her—and resolved to ruin President Obama’s “legacy” by terminating many regulations that he had established to slow climate change and improve consumers’ rights as well as to repeal the ACA. He voiced his criticism of them in hundreds of Tweets, in his speeches, and in interviews. Relentless Campaigning Trump worked harder at connecting to his base supporters than his political opponents. He held non-stop rallies during his presidential campaign—and continued to hold them during his presidency. He often held rallies in areas where voters were not likely to support him, even as he targeted areas inhabited by white blue-collar populations. Unlike Hillary Clinton who liked discussions with five or six voters in a local café, Trump sought large crowds with thousands of supporters. He energized these crowds with his oratory, gestures, attacks, and promises. He campaigned through thousands of Tweets to his base of support, whether by attacking “political elites,” bullying, or attacking at-risk populations. Organizing Effective Campaigns Politicians organize campaign organizations that allow them to reach voters, identify voters’ preferences, make contact with voters electronically and in person, and get the vote out. Barack Obama made effective use of “analytics” to prioritize those districts and those voters that would give him a majority vote in the Electoral College. Democratic and Republican presidential candidates have to coordinate their campaigns, respectively, with the Democratic and Republican National Committees. Once elected, presidents have to organize the Executive Branch effectively, hiring a Chief of Staff, hiring issue-oriented staff, developing a policy agenda, and working with the Congress. Trump won the presidency, surprisingly, with a very lean campaign organization, mostly led by himself, a small staff, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law. Trump’s assertive campaigning allowed him to surmount Hillary Clinton’s huge campaign organization. He cleverly targeted his white base in key swing states. Doubling Down Apologies are not in Trump’s lexicon because he persists in making attacks on people or institutions even when they are widely criticized by the mass media or rivals. He was determined, for example, to ruin President Obama’s legacy by relentlessly attacking his climate policies, his support of the LGBTQ community, his failure to defeat ISIS, his defense of black youth killed by police, and his support of affirmative action. He attacked FBI Director James Comey even though some of his actions may have helped him defeat Hillary Clinton—and eventually fired him. He doubled down when he insisted that Mexico would pay for the Wall even when Mexican leaders said they would not fund it. Rousing Large Crowds of Supporters Trump excelled at electrifying his supporters at large rallies. His modus operandi included holding events at airports where supporters saw his plane land. He often identified “evil forces” that allegedly meant to derail his presidency, like the mass media, opponents who disrupted his rallies with signs and shouting, or foreign nations that conspired to take jobs from Americans, like China and Mexico. He used symbols or promises that appealed to his audiences around a relatively small number of issues, like “build the wall,” “repeal Obamacare,” or “bring the jobs home.” He was in constant motion, often raising his arms into the air. The crowds loved his attacks on the few persons who sought to disrupt rallies, even urging them to shove or hit them. Critics noted that he rarely discussed or analyzed issues, such as identifying the pros and cons of specific policies. Portraying Himself as Independent from Big Donors Trump often portrayed himself as independent from big donors, unlike other Republican candidates or Hillary Clinton. He said that he was self- financing his campaign, unlike opponents who relied on big donors who would dictate their policy choices. Trump can be lauded for steering away from big donors during the campaign. His independence became tarnished, however , when he filled his cabinet with billionaires and multimillionaires when he became president— and when he placed persons associated with the Koch Brothers (who had financed many Republican candidates and causes) in his Administration. Some critics believed he made huge profits from his properties during his campaign, such as holding rallies in them or conversing with foreign leaders in them. Getting Free Media Coverage No candidate has been more adept than Trump at obtaining free media coverage even as he often castigated “liberal media” for undermining his campaign. His “creative hyperbole,” lies, bullying, attacks on the media, attacks on President Obama, and dramatic speeches enhanced media coverage because they were controversial. He received daily media coverage from his relentless tweets that attack others and take controversial positions—even though he resorted to them to bypass media that he believed were biased against him. No candidate in American history has been so talented in getting free coverage from the media by using all of the tactics in his toolbox. We can admire this skill because, after all, media coverage is essential to effective campaigning and governing. Yet he received much of his coverage not from discussing issues but from flamboyant behaviors and Tweets for which other candidates received little coverage. Race Baiting and Attacking Other V ulnerable Populations Trump identified prejudices in his base of support, including dislike of immigrants, Muslims, disabled persons, Latinos, women, African Americans, and others. He appealed to these prejudices on many occasions during the campaign, debates, and in the first year of his presidency. He also appealed to other prejudices, like animus toward scientists, political elites in both major parties, liberals, Easterners, and Californians. Possibly more than any presidential candidate in American history, Trump systematically attacked members of vulnerable populations, even at one point imitating the movements of a person with cerebral palsy at a campaign rally. He implied that immigrants were mostly criminal, rated women on a 10-point scale, implied a Latino judge to be incompetent because of his race, depicted African American communities as mostly riddled with crime, and depicted many Muslim refugees as sympathizing with ISIS even after they had been carefully vetted by the State Department. Ending Obama’s Legacy Trump became obsessed with terminating Obama’s policy legacy by repealing and replacing the ACA, ending many regulations that sought to advance the world’s climate, and contending that Obama’s foreign policy had been inept. These attacks were supplemented by racism when he insisted that Obama had not been born in the United States even when proof was provided. Changing Positions and Policy Priorities Most politicians change positions as they perceive that they were wrong or as they believe that many voters favor other positions. They establish policy priorities, such as (in Trump’s case) “building the wall” or “repealing Obamacare.” When politicians change positions or priorities frequently, however, many voters may view them as opportunistic. Trump changed many of them when he became president. He had pledged not to support cuts in Medicaid only to seek deep cuts in it. He pledged that everyone should have health insurance only to accept health plans that would cause more than 20 million persons to lose it. He insisted that Mexico would finance the Wall only to demand that Congress pay for it or he might shut down the federal government. He said he would not send more troops to the Middle East only to deploy new troops to Afghanistan. He promised quick action to prevent and treat opioid poisoning only to wait to declare an emergency until late summer, 2017. He made a trip to many Asian nations in late 2017, but failed even to discuss trade policies with Chinese leaders even when he described them as negotiating unfair trade deals with the United States. He argued that he would reform taxes that would favor the middle class, only to support an end to inheritance taxes that would enrich his progeny by $1 billion upon his death. Insert 13.1. Critical Analysis: Ethical Analysis of Trump’s “Tool Kit” Discuss which items in Trump’s tool kit are “ethical” and which are “unethical.” To what extent do you believe all politicians, most politicians, or few politicians use his “unethical ones”? How does your assessment influence your views of Trump? Beneﬁting from the Context Trump benefited from a “perfect storm” when he ran for the presidency in 2015. * This perfect storm created discontents from his base of support. While persons with education, training, and capital had zoomed to the high rungs of affluence, tens of millions of Americans had not made economic gains or had descended. They wanted a leader who might bring economic gains to the middle class and below. Trump promised to help the middle class. He promised more and better jobs. The nation had become a truly diverse nation rapidly from the 1960s onward through the immigration of millions of people to the United States from Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and many Asian nations. Laws legitimated the LGBTQ community during the presidency of Obama. Affirmative action increased access to jobs by persons of color and women. Many white people believed they were under attack or marginalized by this growth of diversity. Trump cultivated support from them by attacking at-risk populations. Many Americans wanted a revolt against the political establishment— an establishment that had enacted few laws in an era of gridlock between the two parties, particularly during the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama presidencies. Many people also believed that widespread corruption existed in Washington, D.C., as special interests and lobbyists showered benefits on incumbent politicians. Trump promised to get things done. Trump convinced many voters that he would “drain the swamp” and not be beholden to special interests. LO 13-6 The nation had become remarkably polarized as liberal and conservative people lived in separate “bubbles.” They lived among persons of their own political beliefs such as red and blue states; consumed news from media outlets that conformed to their ideologies; and voted for elected officials that held their respective beliefs. Trump invited polarization with his attacks on liberals and vulnerable populations. Trump’s Remarkable Ascent EP 5c Trump had few misgivings when he announced he would seek the Republican nomination for the presidency. He also knew that he would “win” even if he lost. A presidential campaign would vastly increase his fame on a national and international stage. He would make lots of money from his increased notoriety even as he turned over his business to his two sons. He hoped a run for the presidency would enhance the chances that Ivanka, his daughter, could develop her own political career as she received publicity and high-level roles in his campaign and presidency. It would be a new adventure no matter the outcome. Insert 13.2. Critical Analysis: Can W e Surmount Our “Bubbles” when Assessing Trump? Discuss to what extent “separate bubbles” make it difficult to discuss Trump’s performance as President. Identify your bubble. How would you converse with someone in a different bubble with respect to his performance? Could you find areas of agreement and then move to areas of disagreement? What actions of Trump could you identify as meritorious, problematic, or “wrong” whether on ethical or scientific LO 13-7 grounds? Might you have to agree to disagree with other people, amicably, with respect to some or many issues? Trump entered the race for the Republican Party’s nomination on June 16, 2015, at Trump Tower in New York City. He had developed a platform by this date that centered upon his base of blue-collar white families in rural areas, coal country, and small distressed cities whose manufacturing companies had closed or moved to developing nations in search of lower wages and other benefits. We have discussed how he appealed to their fears, anger, and prejudices. Evangelical voters resonated to Trump’s promise to curtail abortions even though he had supported them, as well as Planned Parenthood earlier. Some white professionals and some white suburban women augmented Trump’s base of white blue collar and evangelical voters. Many member of his base were delighted when Trump aggressively attacked the political elites, whether the presumptive Republican favorite, Jeb Bush, whose father and brother had recently held the presidency, or Hillary Clinton, who had been First Lady during her husband’s two terms as president and Secretary of State during Obama’s first term. Trump faced a battalion of challengers for the Republican nomination. Jeb Bush appeared unbeatable due to his political pedigree and resources. Governors Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich from Ohio, and Scott Wilson from Wisconsin were believed to be viable candidates. Senator Ted Cruz had a considerable following not only in Texas but among evangelical voters. Senators Marco Rubio from Florida and Lindsey Graham from South Carolina had considerable support from Southerners. Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky was the nation’s most prominent libertarian. Trump shot ahead of his many Republican competitors in the polls by August, 2015, a mere three months after entering the presidential race. He accomplished this remarkable feat by developing a unique political message and campaign style. He copyrighted the title of his campaign, “Make America Great Again” even though Ronald Reagan had often used it. The message conveyed his belief that American had been great but had been corrupted by politicians of all stripes who had been inattentive to the needs of ordinary people and had relied on funding by big interests and who were inattentive to the needs of “the people.” He focused his campaign upon white blue-collar Americans at his rallies—a population whose members felt jilted by the nation’s growing diversity. He attacked prior presidents and the existing one, whether Bill Clinton for negotiating NAFTA, George W. Bush for lies that got the nation into the Iraq War, and Barack Obama for enactment of the “ineffective” Affordable Care Act. Adorned with a red hat at his rallies with the title of his campaign inscribed on it, he told followers repeatedly that he would change the course of history by getting them jobs, health care, better schools, personal safety, and self-respect. He promised to curtail immigration by Muslims and Latinos. He coupled this overall message with specific campaign promises, mostly stated in language somewhere between fourth grade and eighth grade levels. He repeated these promises at every rally and debate. He pledged to halt immigration from Mexico by “Building a Wall” and “Banning Muslims until we know what is going on.” He trashed trade treaties such as NAFTA or Obama’s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership on grounds they had or would entice American companies to leave the American rustbelt. He promised to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a new health bill that would hold down insurance fees and deductibles. He pledged to cut American military involvement in the Middle East while also increasing attacks on ISIS and terrorists. He asked Americans to support their police even when they were accused of slaying many unarmed black males. He promised to bring peace to the Middle East. He promised a $1 trillion program to repair the nation’s infrastructure to produce vast numbers of jobs. He promised to cut the taxes of the American middle class, as well as corporate taxes. His campaign rallies were interactive events. He would yell out a theme, like “Build the Wall,” and encourage his supporters to chant it in unison. Then he would yell out a different theme, like “Ban the Muslims” to evoke more audience participation. Then he would yell “Repeal Obama Care.” When protesters infiltrated his rallies, he would yell, “Get Them Out” as security personnel accompanied them from the rally, sometimes inciting supporters to punch them or push them toward an exit. He encouraged his supporters to chant, “Lock her Up,” when referring to Hillary Clinton’s storing of her emails at the State Department on a personal server. He evoked crowd participation by attacking the mass media. He called the mass media liars and the enemy at many of his rallies. He condemned the media for pointing their cameras only to the stage rather than scanning the audience to hide its size. Some members of the news media feared they would be assaulted at his rallies. Trump also gained favor with his crowds by berating President Obama. He lambasted Obamacare. He argued that Obama had led to the formation and growth of ISIS by pulling American troops prematurely from Iraq and refraining from sufficiently aggressive attacks on ISIS. He claimed that ISIS could have been defeated had Obama “taken their oil,” even though international experts said this act would have violated international law. He called Obama incompetent. This animus against Obama, broken only briefly in the wake of a meeting with him just before he was inaugurated, led him to attack virtually all policies that Obama had initiated, including Obamacare, the Paris Climate Accord, and his support for admitting some refugees from Syria after they had been vetted by the State Department. He displayed his unique debating strategy during 12 scheduled debates with Republican protagonists, not counting a debate he boycotted. He repeated his basic themes in these debates. He called his opponents puppets of the establishment. He gave them pejorative nicknames, such as Low-Energy Jeb (Bush), Little Marco (Rubio), or Lying Ted (Cruz). He demeaned them off stage, such as criticizing the appearance of Carla Fiorina’s face. He demeaned debate moderators such as Megyn Kelly from Fox News, implying she had been unfair to him during a debate because she was in her menstrual cycle. He criticized Chris Christie for embracing President Obama after Hurricane Sandy because he had provided funds to help its victims. He ridiculed Scott Walker, the Governor of Wisconsin, arguing he had harmed Wisconsin’s economy even though the state had record economic growth. He argued late in the campaign that Ted Cruz’s father, an evangelical pastor, had participated in the assassination of John Kennedy decades earlier, with no proof other than a photo where he (apparently) appeared next to Lee Harvey Oswald who had shot Kennedy. He spared Dr. Ben Carson, an African American brain surgeon, and John Kasich, the Governor of Ohio, from his invective possibly because he hoped they might join his Administration. Trump’s skills in his toolbox were ideally suited for these debates. He intimidated his opponents by calling them names, calling them elitists, and contending they would be captives of big donors. He singled out Jeb Bush for particular criticism, calling him “Low Energy Jeb.” He often linked him to his brother, former president George W. Bush, declaring him to be one of the most ineffective presidents in American history. He made outsized promises of the many successes he would have during his presidency. His aggressive strategy made him the star of each of the Republicans’ debates. Experts contended he won each of them. He received poll numbers far higher than each of his Republican opponents. His success in the debates was buttressed by his steady victories in Republican primaries. He won them throughout the nation with the exception of victories by Ted Cruz in Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, Maine, Idaho, Utah, Texas, and Wisconsin because of his support from evangelical voters. He won most of the votes of blue-collar whites, as well as many women and seniors. Defeating Hillary Clinton Trump’s skills in his tool kit were also ideally suited to defeat Hillary Clinton. If Trump excelled at large rallies, Secretary Clinton preferred small groups who would share ideas across a table. She liked to discuss issues in depth rather than using slogans. She understood a broad array of policy issues stemming from her many years in Washington. She knew an army of policy analysts, even listening to suggestions from 200 of them about how to decrease income inequality. Trump decided early in his campaign to out-hustle her. If she wanted small numbers, he would organize large rallies. If she took herself off the campaign trail for long periods to raise funds from big donors, he campaigned relentlessly. If she went only to those locations where data suggested she might obtain many votes, he went everywhere he could find an audience. He often held his rallies at airports where his plane landed, taxied to the rally site, and then departed as he proceeded to several more rallies. If she was cautious, he was provocative and controversial. LO 13-8 Figure 13.2. AFP/Getty Images Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton debates Republican nominee Donald Trump in Los Vegas. Trump attacked her strength: her many years in public life as First Lady, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State. He argued that she was part of the establishment. He implied that she had enabled her husband’s numerous affairs by not divulging his marital fidelity. He questioned whether she had legislative successes as U.S. Senator even though she had co-sponsored scores of legislative measures. He resurrected the charge that she had facilitated the terrorist attack on the American Embassy in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 by not providing sufficient security staff even though Congress had vindicated her for malfeasance. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating whether she had engaged in a criminal offense by storing classified material on her home server when she was Secretary of State, he argued she was guilty even after the FBI had absolved her. He alleged that the Clinton Foundation, created by her husband, had obtained funds from disreputable people—and that she had engaged in “pay to play” schemes and granted interviews only to persons who had made large donations to the Foundation. He contended she would be “bought” by persons and corporations that funded her one-billion-dollar campaign. He noted she had supported NAFTA, as well as the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership Treaty that President Obama had supported and accused her of dishonesty when she reversed on position on the latter treaty. He called her “Crooked Hillary” early in his campaign. He invited attenders of his rallies to chant, “Lock Her Up” despite the fact that she had not been convicted of any crime. He told her during a debate that his first act of office would be to launch criminal investigations of her that would place her in jail. He tried to intimidate her in a Town Hall debate by lurking behind her on the stage as she spoke. Clinton encountered the surprising emergence of Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont as a bona fide threat. A self-described “Democratic Socialist,” Sanders had risen from local offices to the Congress, where he served for 16 years in the House before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. He was not known as a prolific legislator although he had succeeded in funding scores of primary health clinics in low-income areas. Sanders had a simple economic message that he repeated at his campaign stops and during his debates with Clinton: place limits on corporations and banks whose actions had caused the Great Recession of 2007 through 2009; decrease poverty and inequality by enhancing social programs; fund college tuition of all students attending public universities; revise unfair trade treaties like the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership as well as NAFTA; decrease military engagements of the United States; increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024; and move beyond the ACA to enact a Medicare-for-All health system. He favored tax reforms that would increase taxes of the rich to fund programs for less affluent people. He was the only presidential candidate who talked about the negative impact of poverty on millions of persons. Sanders’ message appealed to tens of millions of millennial voters who were born between 1982 and 2000. They had record levels of tuition debt. Many of them lived with parents because they could not find employment during and after the Great Recession. They were more responsive to a liberal message than many older voters. They wanted change rather than “more of the same.” They dominated Sanders’ audiences during his rallies. They volunteered for his campaign. Unlike Clinton who sought funds from big donors, Sanders raised large sums from hundreds of thousands of donors who averaged $27 apiece. Many older liberals joined millennial persons to form an impressive base of support for Sanders. Sanders argued that Hillary Clinton lacked an economic message. He accused her of supporting NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership before recently changing her position. He said she failed to release transcripts of her lucrative speeches to Wall Street audiences. While he attacked Trump vigorously as a conservative, his interactions with Clinton were mostly amicable. Sanders faced an uphill battle because he encountered (in his words) the “Clinton political machine” that Bill Clinton had constructed during his presidency. He was too liberal for many voters. Many other voters feared that he could not win as a relative newcomer on the national stage. African American voters mostly supported Clinton due to the long-standing connections between their leaders and pastors and Bill and Hillary Clinton, but a cadre of African Americans, led by celebrities Harry Belafonte and Spike Lee, supported Sanders. Sanders ultimately won 26 state primaries— some of them by one-sided votes. Clinton won by winning an array of Southern states where African Americans supported her by wide margins, as well as big states like New York, Illinois, and California that had huge numbers of voters. Insert 13.3. Critical Analysis: Compare and Contrast Bernie Sanders and Donald T rump Discuss similarities and differences of Senator Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump. Both have been called “populists,” yet deep differences exist between them. Compare their ideologies. Compare their bases of support, Compare their ethical codes. Winning the Presidential Election Clinton and Trump engaged in three debates in fall 2016 after their party had nominated each of them. Clinton was often an effective candidate. She noted that Trump had never held public office. She criticized his materialism. She criticized his racism against African American, Latinos, and immigrants. She criticized his attacks against Muslims. She criticized his misogyny when he called Fox News Reporter Megan Kelly a “bimbo” and made a lewd comment about her. She criticized him late in the campaign when a video clip went viral that showed him making sexist comments about women as he exited a bus. She criticized his failure to pay workers at specific job sites. She contended that Trump University had cheated its enrollees. Most experts rated Clinton as the victor in each of her debates with Trump. She displayed greater knowledge about policies. She attacked his prejudices. She documented his lack of experience in government. She attacked his misstatements during the campaign. She kept her cool. Yet Trump benefited from his loyal base. They believed he won most or all of the presidential debates even as most experts believed she had prevailed in them. His base liked Trump’s contention that he was the subject of a conspiracy with the mass media, pundits, and corporate American against him. Many of them liked his attacks on Muslims and immigrants. Trump benefited from some lucky breaks. The Russian government hacked the emails of the Democratic National Committee—and released them to the website, WikiLeaks, that had been developed by Julian Assange to disseminate classified information from the U.S. Defense Department and intelligence-gathering agencies. Assange had found refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London that prevented his extradition to the U.S. government, where he would have been prosecuted for disseminating LO 13-9 classified American information. Some of these emails cast a negative light on Clinton, such as criticisms of her by John Podesta, her campaign manager. Even more damaging to Clinton was a last-minute disclosure by James Comey, the Director of the FBI, just eight days before the election, that tens of thousands of new emails during her stint as Secretary of State had just been discovered on the email server of the husband of a top aide. He had decided months earlier that Clinton had not broken the law, but now decided to re-open his investigation on the eve of the election. He declared just days before the election, once again, that Clinton had not broken laws —but this renewal of the investigation may have swung support from Clinton. Long after her defeat by Trump, she contended that Comey’s re- opening of the investigation and other factors had cost her the election, but David Axelrod, who had run campaigns for President Obama, countered that these factors would not have been so damaging to Clinton if her campaign had not already been damaged by internal dissension, her failure to campaign in key swing states where Trump had considerable support from white rural voters, and her lack of an economic message to create new jobs. Trump doubled down on blue-collar whites in the swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan in the final days of the campaign at the very time that Clinton focused her energies elsewhere. He was aided, as well, by two third-party candidates: Gary Johnson from the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein from the Green Party. Even though they received far fewer votes than Trump and Clinton, they may have swung the balance to Trump in closely fought states like Florida, Colorado, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin on the assumption that their voters might otherwise have voted for Clinton. * The election countdown began on the evening of November 8. It soon became clear that the election’s outcome would be decided in roughly six states: Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Trump won each of these states primarily because blue-collar whites turned out in record numbers. Trump also won female votes by a narrow margin, as well as a majority of the votes of seniors. He obtained roughly 30% of Latino votes. While Clinton won the popular vote by roughly 3 million votes, she obtained only 227 electoral votes compared to Trump’s 306 votes because he won his electoral votes in key swing states with many electoral votes. A question hung over Trump in the immediate wake of his upset victory. Would he fulfill his promises to white blue-collar voters in light of his lack of experience in government and a Republican Party fractured into moderate and conservative factions? Could he secure sufficient votes in the U.S. Senate where his party had only a two-vote majority even as it had a substantial majority of 46 votes in the House? Did he intend to fulfill his promises to his base or did he mostly view them as providing a ticket to the White House? In other words, might he betray them? Trump’s Hurdles to Being a “Successful” President Trump had to jump many hurdles to have a successful presidency, as measured by enactment of his campaign promises including personal ones, ones related to both political parties, ones related to his base of support, and ones related to governing. LO 13-10 Personal Hurdles Trump had never held political office. He often sought contracts and resources from politicians, but only as an outsider. He had personal habits, moreover, that could harm his ability to put together a winning majority. He had been used to running his own operation in the real estate business where he was in charge rather than running the White House and the Executive Branch where he would have to rely heavily on a chief of staff, Congressional liaison staff, members of his Cabinet, and key party leaders like Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader. Were he to lack experienced staff in the White House, he risked chaos. Were he to rely excessively on his family members, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, respectively, his son-in-law and daughter? Trump’s long-established penchant for hyperbole and lies could make governing more difficult for him at home and abroad. Would he keep promises? Would he keep confidences? Would he be truthful? Trump’s use of Tweets on a daily basis posed problems for his Administration. Usually without consulting his presidential staff and cabinet officials, he issues hundreds of Tweets, often during the early morning hours. In the eyes of his staff, they were often off message, such as attacking the Mayor of London for a specific ISIS event, attacking the Republican Speaker of the House, or calling the Democatic Minority Leader of the Senate a “clown.” It was unknown if he could be effective in his dealings with the leaders of other nations because he had no experience in foreign policy. He has a penchant for dictators, leading him not to confront them. On a trip to Asia in November 2017, for example, he failed to criticize Vladimir Putin, the Russian dictator, for interfering in the 2016 American presidential election; failed to criticize the President of the Philippines for human rights violations by ordering the murder of thousands of drug addicts; and (actually) praised Xi Jinping, the Chinese dictator, for implementing unfair trade treaties with the United States. It was unknown whether he could surmount personal controversies related to his real estate empire and his efforts to slow or end investigations of himself—investigations undertaken by Special Counsel Robert Mueller after Trump had fired FBI Director James Comey. Would investigators find collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians in disseminating negative information about the Clinton campaign from hacks of the files of the Democratic National Committee? Would investigators find other crimes by Trump, family members, and associates that occurred prior to his presidency in light of the sheer size of financial dealings? Would court cases emerge that might find him guilty of sexual harassment before he became president? Might Congress and the Department of Justice dog him with legal proceedings like President Richard Nixon that would distract him and his staff from their work, or even lead to his impeachment? Critics wondered about his competence to be president. He refused to have daily intelligence briefings, unlike all of his presidential predecessors going back to World War II—and wanted them distilled into bullet points when he read intelligence reports. He often seemed not to understand specific policies, such as provisions in the ACA when the House of Representatives repealed and replaced it. He sometimes embarrassed his aides when he blurted out classified information to foreign leaders. He sometimes tried to bully foreign leaders such as when he unsuccessfully pressured the President of Mexico to pay for the Wall. He often stepped on his own message, such as attacking Clinton months after he had defeated her just as he was trying to convince the Congress to repeal the ACA. Critics also wondered whether he had a moral base as witnessed by his attacks against persons of color, Muslims, women, and persons with disabilities. Would his penchant for hyperbole and lying lead him to lose support in the nation and his own party? Would some of the people he bullied, including fellow Republicans, turn on him at some future point? Critics wondered, too, whether his extravagant life style would impact his presidency negatively. He mostly appointed billionaires and multimillionaires to his Cabinet. Would he address the needs of white blue- collar people that he had championed in his rallies as well as the needs of other vulnerable populations when relying on Cabinet members who often had little rapport with them? Critics wondered, too, whether he was sufficiently self-centered or narcissistic that he would place personal fame over the interests of the nation. Would his presidency become a series of personal quests for coverage rather than meritorious policy initiatives? Some critics wondered if he was mentally stable. Hurdles Related to the Republican Party Trump began with twin hardships at the outset of his presidency, the slim majority in the Senate and his narrow victory over Clinton. Unlike Ronald Reagan in 1983 who had a Senate majority of eight votes, Trump only had a majority of two votes. If Reagan had relatively amicable relations with Republican leaders in the Congress, Trump had been at odds with many Republican leaders during his presidential campaign when House Speaker Paul Ryan had criticized him for unethical behavior—and when other Republicans recalled how he had bullied Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio during his campaign. He even said he did not admire war-hero Senator John McCain because he had been captured and imprisoned for years by the Vietcong in the Vietnam War. Due to Barack Obama’s landslide wins in 2008 and 2012 and his eight-year presidency, most Republican members of Congress were not used to leading the nation. They were skilled in gridlocking the government, but lacked skills in running it. The Republican Party was divided, moreover, into conservative and moderate factions that hardly spoke to one another on key issues. Keep in mind that the conservative wing had descended from the Tea Party that had emerged in 2009—now called the Freedom Caucus. The Tea Party had demanded deep cuts in taxes and social programs. They had flooded town meetings of Republicans to demand hard-right policies rather than the centrist policies of George W. Bush. They had greatly augmented their numbers in huge Republican victories in 2010 and 2014 Congressional elections. “Compromise” was not in their vocabulary—and many conservative Republicans in 2016 and onward reflected this intransigence. Trump soon found himself caught between Republican moderates and Republican far-right policitians. It soon became apparent that Trump did not wish to cooperate with Democrats. He did not consult them with respect to any of his major legislative initiatives in 2017. Hurdles Related to the Democratic Party Many Democrats believed on the eve of the presidential election that Hillary Clinton would prevail. Disbelief soon morphed into anger. Some people blamed Clinton for failing to campaign sufficiently in swing states. Many Democrats and activists moved toward action when they organized nationwide marches by women, immigrants, and healthcare and climate activists in winter and spring 2017. Other Democrats and activists launched movements known as Indivisible and We the People that focused on personal encounters with incumbent Republicans at town meetings in their districts, as well as protests at the President’s properties and the White House. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi became the de facto leaders of the Democratic Party. They encountered a president who made no effort to collaborate with them. They made overtures to collaborate with him on the ACA, infrastructure and tax reform to no avail. The Democratic Party had its own divisions between its moderate wing and its activist wing, represented, respectively, by Hillary and Bill Clinton and by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Hurdles Related to His Base of Support Trump deserves credit for championing the needs of blue-collar white people in rural areas and smaller cities in Midwestern states, mountain states, New England, Appalachia, and the South as we have discussed. He would find it difficult to work with Republican elites, however, when he was pressured by advisor Steve Bannon to remain true to his populist creed. He wanted Trump not to cooperate with Mitch McConnell, the long-time Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate. He wanted Trump to withdraw troops from the Middle East. He wanted him to focus on America First by withdrawing from virtually all treaties and climate agreements. He wanted Trump to support far-right politicians like Republican Senator Roy Moore of Alabama even though many women charged him with sexual harassment when they were teenagers. He wanted Trump to fire Robert Mueller, the FBI Director who was investigating Trump on multiple charges. Bannon was highly popular among Trump’s white blue-collar voters. As Trump sought to appease Bannon and other far-right politicians, he risked alienating establishment and moderate Republicans, not to mention many independent voters. Bannon continued to pressure Trump to maintain a populist and “American First” posture even after Trump had dismissed him in fall 2017. Figure 13.3. Details Epics/Getty Images March for Women’s Rights after Donald Trump’s Inauguration. Governing Hurdles Tax expert Edward Kleinbard identified three faults of Trump that might jeopardize his effectiveness as a policy maker: inexperience, incompetence, and infighting. * Inexperience was a key weakness since Trump had never held a position in government, nor had any of his cabinet members. He viewed the Congress not as a separate and co-equal branch of the government, but under his direction. He didn’t know how to move legislation through Congress. He was not familiar with the sheer length of time to get legislation enacted. He didn’t know how to negotiate with public officials because he had primarily negotiated with bankers, realtors, and property owners in the private sector. Nor did Trump move rapidly in his first year to recruit staff experienced in running the government. Incompetence partly stemmed from Trump’s failure to hire people with proven knowledge. He placed neurologist Ben Carson, for example, as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) even though he had no experience in housing—and believed people became poor primarily due to defects in their personal character. Carson minimized the role of low wages, lack of work, disabilities, lack of affordable housing, mental health problems and addictions, poor schools, and lack of job training programs in causing poverty. None of his Cabinet choices had worked in the public sector. Some of them came into the jobs with fixed goals, such as Betsy Devos who wanted to greatly increase the number of charter schools in the United States—or Scott Pruitt, the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) who wanted to rescind most regulations that had been enacted by Obama to protect the environment. Few of them understood the statutes and regulations that they would have to navigate—nor did Trump. Infighting might plague a White House that lacked an experienced chief of staff who organized the White House’s staff into a team. Trump’s team in spring and summer 2017 included populist and nationalist Steve Bannon, moderate economist Gary Cohn, centrist family members like son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daugher Ivanka Kushner, mainline Republicans like Reince Priebus and Shawn Spicer, and the conservative Vice President Mike Pense. Trump tried to bring order to infighting by replacing Chief of Staff Reince Priebus with General John Kelly in August 2017, who promptly fired Bannon and others. He also tried to reduce an epidemic of leaks from staff to the press. Kelly tried to establish more coherence in Trump’s communications. Two sides of Trump emerged during his presidency. There was a “scripted Trump” who gave speeches from a teleprompter. These speeches were organized and to the point, often drafted by aides or Cabinet officials. The “unscripted Trump” took two forms. Some were hundreds of Tweets written off the cuff by Trump with little consultation with his staff who would read them in the press the following day. Some were speeches given in the style he had used during the campaign. They attacked legislators and others. They attacked the press. They sometimes contained attacks on immigrants. They were often divisive in nature. Critics often viewed the unscripted Trump as undisciplined and not focusing on his primary legislative goals. The speeches and the Tweets were often used by the unscripted Trump to communicate with his base of white supporters. Flynn hoped to persuade Trump to use more scripted communications. Trump was used to running his real estate empire unilaterally, where he made the big decisions. He took personal credit for the growth of his fortune. He demanded obedience from his staff. Successful presidents often learn, however, that they need to rely on their staff to devise policies because of the complexity of policy making in the White House. Trump often talked about his presidency in personal terms, like I will bring voters so many rapid successes that they will get tired of seeing them practically on a daily basis or I will repeal and replace the ACA. General Kelly hoped to create a team in the White House. Presidents often have their greatest political capital during their first and second years in office when they are fresh off their election. Members of their party in the Congress see them as winners—and often hope the victorious president will help them get re-elected in coming years. Recall that Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama enacted considerable legislation in their first two years. All of these presidents had won elections for their first term by wide margins. Trump had less political capital than his counterparts for several reasons. He received a majority of electoral votes, but received 3 million fewer votes than Clinton. He failed to use even this political capital as effectively as his counterparts. He lacked rapport with Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, who he frequently attacked on Twitter— not even talking with McConnell for more than two weeks in August 2017. He encountered deep divisions in the Republican Party between conservative and moderate wings. He lacked the political skills that these other presidents possessed because he had never held political office. His personal qualities, such as his penchant for Tweeting and bullying, undermined a disciplined strategy. His refusal to work across the aisle with Democrats stands in marked contrast with these other Republican presidents —all of whom struck deals with the opposing party. He often stepped on his own message, such as not even talking about his infrastructure proposal during a speech that was supposed to feature it in August 2017. Numerous polls indicated that President Trump was the most unpopular president in recent history during his first year in office. His popularity swung between 32% and 40%. While his base of support remained mostly supportive, independent voters, who helped him win the presidency, began to move away from him by November 2017. Trump also selected a highly divisive and complex piece of legislation, the repeal and replacement of the ACA, as his first major policy initiative. He should have known that the ACA had been associated with extreme conflict between the two parties when President Obama barely enacted it in 2010. Had he selected infrastructure, by contrast, he would have been more likely to secure a major success because every member of Congress has bridges and roads that need to be repaired in their districts. Many of them had airports that could not handle their current airline traffic. Early Signs that T rump W ould Govern from the Right EP 5c Trump’s selection of members of his Cabinet gave clues about how he would govern. With the exception of two women and one African American, Trump’s cabinet was composed of white men. Trump nominated a host of billionaires and multimillionaires to his Cabinet with incomes that exceeded even the members of the Cabinet of President Eisenhower in the 1950s. None of Trump’s nominees had records of seeking reforms to help white blue-collar people or disadvantaged populations. Further, none of them had held elective office. Far from “draining the swamp,” Trump had selected persons who often had deep conflicts of interest. In the words of Nina Burleigh, “They’ve been coaxed out of their mansions and off their yachts by President Trump to make American great again—for the very, very rich. The billionaires were “not government-hating ideologues like the Koch brothers … but are more like what Trump used to be—unaf filiated centrists” … with an agenda “defined by those matters that affect their wallets.” Most came from “the 1980s generation of leveraged-buyout tacticians, junk bond kings, corporate raiders and vulture capitalists … to take advantage of Ronald Reagan’s great gift to Wall Street—ripping up regulations put in place after the Great Depression” * They included Stephen Schwarzman, worth $11.8 billion, who chairs Trump’s Strategy and Policy Forum; Steve Roth, worth $1.1 billion, who is Co-Chair of Trump’s Infrastructure Committee; Stephen LO 13-11 Feinberg, worth $1.2 billion, who is an unofficial advisor on the Intelligence Committee; Wilbur Ross, worth $2.5 billion, who is Commerce Secretary; Richard Lefrak, worth $6.5 billion, who is Co-Chair of Trump’s Infrastructure Committee; “Woody” Johnson IV, worth $6.3 billion, who is the Ambassador to the United Kingdom; Betsy DeVos, worth $5.1 billion, Secretary of Education; Todd Ricketts, worth $5.3 billion, Deputy Secretary of Commerce; Stephan Mnuchin, worth $500 million, who is Secretary of the Treasury; and Linda McMahon, worth $1.16 billion, Head of Small Business Administration. Some other Cabinet members and advisors are millionaires but have hard-right ideologies, such as Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) who presented Trump’s first budget that proposed billions of dollars in cuts to social programs like Food Stamps and Medicaid even as he favored large tax cuts for wealthy Americans. Ben Carson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development contended that poverty is created by defects in character. Tom Price, Secretary of Health and Human Services, worth $13.6 million, favored repealing Obamacare and replacing it with tax credits and health savings accounts even when the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) contended that his approach would make 23 million Americans lose health coverage in the next 10 years. (Price resigned after reporters discovered he had made many flights on private airplanes at public expense rather than using commercial flights.) Persons of great wealth can support social causes, such as multibillionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, Jr., but none of Trump’s appointees came from this group. Buffett had begged the federal government, for example, to increase his taxes because his tax rates were lower than his secretary’s tax rates—and chose to give his fortune mostly to the philanthropic Bill and Malinda Gates Foundation. None of his Cabinet officials had publicly supported social programs particularly needed by white blue-collar people including expanded health programs, enhanced safety-net programs like SNAP (food stamps), a higher minimum wage, and a massive intervention to diminish deaths from opioid addiction. Trump’s focus on blue-collar whites had merit, but he had little interest in the other vulnerable populations that I identified in Chapters 1 and 2 , including persons of color, seniors, children, women, and persons with disabilities. Contrast Trump, for example, with Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon who developed programs to help many vulnerable populations. Contrast Trump with President Obama who got an $800 billion initiative through Congress to move the nation through the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009, enacted the ACA, enacted bank regulations to decrease fraudulent lending, helped the LGBTQ community to be able to marry legally, as well as regulations to allow “Dreamer” immigrants that were brought to the United States as children by their undocumented parents to remain in the United States. Insert 13.4. Critical Analysis: Addressing the Needs of Other V ulnerable Populations Trump selected blue-collar whites as his base of support. Select another at-risk vulnerable population and make the case that its members have needs and problems not dissimilar from blue-collar whites. Should Trump have expanded his base of support to include them? Did his prejudices impede him from expanding his base? Analyzing T rump’s Early Policies Let’s evaluate Trump’s early policies into fall 2017 with respect to three ethical principles that are highlighted in the Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Work (NASW): 1. Do these policies help vulnerable populations with their material, health, mental health, and other basic needs? 2. Do these policies advance the civil rights of vulnerable populations such as persons of color, immigrants, LGBTQ persons, senior citizens, women, and children? 3. Are these policies supported by empirical evidence that shows that they will be effective? These early policies included Trump’s attempt to repeal and replace the ACA, decrease immigration to the United States, create new jobs, develop a budget, cut regulations, and cut taxes. LO 13-12 Repealing and Replacing the ACA Recall that the ACA had five major goals: to decrease the number of persons who lacked health insurance, increase the quality of private health insurance, decrease rising costs of medical care, increase primary health care and preventive care. and slow the rising cost of healthcare. It had made progress in each of these areas when comparing health care in 2010 and 2017. 1. Goal 1: Incr ease Coverage . When the ACA was enacted in 2010, roughly 44 million Americans lacked health insurance. Persons who lacked health insurance, whether from private insurance companies or from Medicaid, had to go without it, use low-cost public clinics and hospitals, or persuade private doctors or hospitals to give them free care. The ACA decreased the number of uninsured Americans markedly from 2010 to 2017 through a combination of strategies. Prior to 2010, employers were not required to provide health insurance to their employees, so many of them chose not to provide it on the grounds that they could not afford it or simply didn’t want to foot the cost. Small companies were particularly likely not to provide health insurance. The ACA mandated all employers provide their employees with private health insurance. It gave subsidies in the form of tax credits to companies with less than 25 employees to help them fund their employees’ health insurance. The ACA also provided subsidies to low-income persons who obtained their insurance from “state exchanges” that were run either by specific states or by the federal government. The ACA assumed that many insurance companies would list their products on the exchanges so that consumers could decide which ones best fit their needs and their budgets. The ACA gave states the option of raising the eligibility level of their Medicaid programs LO 13-13 and their Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) so that millions of Americans who were ineligible for them due to their level of income would become eligible for them. Many states chose not to raise eligibility levels in their states, but 31 others, including California, New York, and Ohio made this choice. States that did not raise the eligibility were remarkably harsh on their own citizens since roughly 10.7 million people with income just over Medicaid eligibility in them were deprived of Medicaid because their states chose not to raise their Medicaid eligibility levels—even though the federal government would have fully funded the extra cost. * This was a significant accomplishment because millions of Americans could now afford medications, hospital care, and physicians’ visits because of the ACA. Many young people could not afford health insurance, so the ACA allowed youth up to age 26 to be covered by their parents’ policies. 2. Goal 2: Incr ease the Coverage and Quality of Private Health Insurance . Many insurance companies failed to provide key services to consumers in 2010. When the ACA was enacted in 2010, millions of Americans were denied coverage by private health insurance companies because they had pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rheumatoid arthritis, neurological diseases like epilepsy, and scores of others. The ACA required coverage for these consumers. It mandated reproductive health services for women in private insurance plans. 3. Goal 3: Decr ease the Rate of Cost Incr eases in Medical Services . The cost of medical services had risen dramatically prior to 2010, at rates considerably in excess of inflation in the general economy. Medical inflation was so high that many experts believed in 2010 that the United States would soon devote 20% of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) to medical costs. The ACA placed limits on the extent private insurance companies funded their advertising and administrative costs as compared to their funding of patients’ health costs. It established state exchanges so that consumers could compare costs of different health plans and select ones that met their needs at the lowest cost. The ACA mandated young people to purchase health insurance to cut health costs in private insurance because they have fewer medical conditions, such as chronic diseases, than older persons. It mandated escalating fines on those young persons who failed to obtain health insurance. Inclusion of young people did cut the costs of the ACA. While these policies of the ACA curbed medical inflation, it rose from 2011 to 2017 due to factors outside of its purview. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies continued to raise the cost of their products. American hospitals gave far more access to expensive MRIs and other diagnostic procedures than counterparts in Canada and Europe. It is likely that medical inflation would have been considerably higher had many of the ACA provisions not been enacted. 4. Goal 4: Incr ease Primary Car e and Health Pr evention . Many low- income persons had poor access to health care in 2010 because medical programs were often not located in their communities. The ACA opened many new primary care health programs in low-income neighborhoods. It required wellness exams for seniors. It mandated implementation of prevention programs found to be effective by medical researchers. The ACA significantly improved medical care in the United States by making progress on these four goals. It was not a panacea, however, because it functioned within the larger American medical system that had significant shortcomings such as runaway inflation. Realize that the ACA was a relatively small innovation within the vast American medical system so that it cannot be blamed for the nation’s healthcare problems . Roughly 85% of insured Americans received their health insurance from their employers as compared to far fewer that received their care from the insurance exchanges of the ACA state exchanges or from enhanced Medicaid. The relatively small ACA which had made considerable progress on its four goals. A crisis had developed in some states, such as Iowa, with respect to the state insurance markets. Some private insurance companies had raised their premiums markedly—or had withdrawn from the exchanges—on grounds that they couldn’t achieve sufficient profits. While they received considerable subsidies from the federal government for low-income enrollees, they contended that they were insufficient. When they exited the exchanges, they reduced the number of options for consumers even to one insurance company and maybe, soon, no options. Enter Donald Trump. He promised he would “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” hundreds of times during his many campaign rallies. He blamed the ACA for the exodus of some private insurance companies from state exchanges. Critics believed he wanted to increase this crisis to put pressure on Republicans to enact a replacement for the ACA. He also wanted to fulfill his campaign promise to repeal and replace the ACA. Indeed, House Republicans had voted many times to repeal the ACA during Obama’s presidency but the U.S. Senate took no action because its members realized that President Obama would veto any repeal measure. Trump turned to Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, to devise an alternative to the ACA soon after he was inaugurated. It was a harsh alternative that included scrapping state exchanges, ending requirements placed on private insurance, terminating the ACA’s primary health clinics, ending subsidies to low-income people, and ending enhanced Medicaid and CHIP eligibility levels for persons who had not qualified for them prior to enactment of the ACA. His alternative to the ACA relied on “free markets,” such as having people develop private health savings accounts that would provide resources for Americans to shop in medical markets. He had been unwilling, however, to put sufficient public money in these accounts that consumers would have been able to fund their medical care. Nor had special state-funded programs for persons with chronic conditions been effective in the few states that had implemented Neither Trump nor Ryan consulted any Democrats in shaping their legislative proposal. Democrats favored repairing the ACA rather than repealing and repairing it. Why not, they asked, keep its strengths, while making improvements in it? Why throw as many as 24 million Americans from private insurance or enhanced Medicaid? Why not enact federal “reinsurance” that would give federal subsidies to private insurance companies that left state exchanges on grounds they were losing money? Why not revive a “public option” that was considered by the Congress when it enacted the ACA that would implement a government insurance plan that would compete with private health insurance plans on the state exchanges? Democrats had wanted to repair the ACA during Obama’s presidency by making these changes, but knew it was fruitless when Republicans, intent on repealing the ACA, held a majority in the House and/or Senate. Polls in 2016 and 2017 showed that Americans overwhelmingly favored “repair” over “repeal.” Trump made the insurance crisis even more severe by implying that he might cut the federal subsidies given to private insurance companies for their low-income enrollees in the state exchanges. As insurance companies believed these subsidies might be cut, they raised their premiums and deductibles higher to remain solvent. Trump was, in effect, sabotaging the ACA by creating the very market uncertainty that insurance companies dislike. Ryan’s version immediately encountered a firestorm in the House of Representatives. Destined not to receive any Democratic votes, Republicans soon realized that moderate Republicans unanimously opposed it along with a few other Republicans. Moreover, a firestorm of protest erupted from Republican constituents who realized they might lose their health insurance if Ryan’s plan was approved—including many blue-collar whites. They flooded town hall meetings of many House Republicans. They shouted their opposition to Ryan’s proposal to cut the ACA provision that allowed states to increase Medicaid eligibility levels to allow many people to receive it who had income just above its current levels in specific states. They opposed Ryan’s cuts in subsidies to low-income persons that allowed them to afford private insurance, as well as Ryan’s cuts in subsidies to small companies to help them fund their employees’ health insurance. They complained that they would no longer be able to afford medications if they lost coverage under Ryan’s plan. They feared that Ryan’s version would be insufficient to help people with opioid and other addictions. They loudly opposed ending enhanced Medicaid that allowed many people to enroll in it when their incomes just exceeded existing Medicaid eligibility levels in their states. Initially standing on the sidelines, Trump joined the fray by reaching out to members of both the moderate and conservative wings of House Republicans. Ryan now faced a teeter-totter dilemma. If he placed provisions in his proposed ACA replacement that Republican moderates liked, many conservative Republicans were more likely to vote against it. If he kept provisions in it that conservative Republicans liked, moderates were more likely to oppose it. It was a numbers game that lasted for weeks. Ryan eventually won this bruising battle with help from Trump and other Republican leaders. Not a single Democrat voted for Ryan’s legislation. Finally, Republicans narrowly enacted a replacement of the ACA. Democrats were furious that Republicans had not waited for an evaluation of the legislation by the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that gave technical evaluations of proposed legislation. Why rush things, they asked, before you know the impact of your legislation on your constituents? Republicans received bad news when the CBO issued its evaluation of the House replacement version on May 24th. The CBO estimated it would cause 23 million persons to lose insurance within 10 years. It predicted that this version would harm low-income people and seniors. The loss of medical insurance was particularly frightening to the many white blue- collar persons who had disabled health conditions from coal mining such, such as black lung disease, or who had substance abuse problems from opioid drugs and alcohol. A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicated that only 8% of the population wanted this version to be enacted (CNN, 5/31/17). Once again, Republicans’ constituents, as well as progressive Democrats, came out in force to protest the passage of the House version because many of them needed health insurance provided by the ACA. They booed their elected officials. They chanted, “Do your job.” They gave testimonials about how they might die if they could not afford their medications. They put fear in the hearts of Republicans not just in swing districts, such as ones where Hillary Clinton had fared well, but in districts where voters had elected Republicans for decades. The battle had just begun because many U.S. Senators from both parties said they would not support the House version. With Mitch McConnell leading the way with support from Vice President Mike Pence and Trump, Senators cobbled together an ACA replacement after weeks of wrangling. It also received negative evaluations from the CBO that estimated that it would cause roughly 20 million people to lose insurance coverage. As with the House version, Republican constituents, as well as some activists, attended Town Hall meetings and loudly protested this Senate version. The Senate replacement of the ACA was defeated when three Republican Senators, including John McCain who returned to Washington, D.C., when recuperating from brain cancer in Arizona, cast the deciding negative vote. Not a single Democrat voted for the Senate version. Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, threw in the towel. This defeat was a serious blow for President Trump. He had promised during his campaign that he would produce so many legislative victories that Americans would become tired of seeing them. By failing his first major legislative test, he appeared more vulnerable to legislators from both parties, unlike President Reagan who got multiple pieces of social, tax, and budget policies through Congress in his first year with nearly unanimous support from Republicans and considerable support from Democrats. Many contended he had made a mistake by placing the ACA on the agenda rather than an infrastructure program that might have been less divisive than health care. Others questioned whether bullying some members of his party during the ACA deliberations had been wise, such as asking Mitch McConnell to consider resigning as Senate Majority leader because he had failed to enact an ACA replacement. Critics argued that Trump sought to sabotage the ACA in the wake of his inability to repeal it; such as by not funding outreach programs to convince uninsured persons to seek insurance on the ACA’s exchanges. He also sought to repeal the mandate for young people to purchase insurance in tax legislation in fall 2017—a decision that would have raised insurance premiums because young people have lower levels of illness than older persons who mostly seek insurance to fund their medical care. Reforming Immigration Policies The United States has moved from periods of relatively liberal immigration policies to relatively restrictive ones when large numbers of white Americans came to fear that immigrants took jobs from them. Trump made immigration restriction a key part of his platform, arguing that immigrants took jobs away from American citizens. He also contended that Muslim immigrants posed terrorist dangers. He argued that many Latino immigrants raped and murdered Americans, even inviting citizens who had been attacked by them. Many immigration experts contended that Trump’s arguments simplified and distorted actual realities. Undocumented Latinos, whether from Mexico or Central America, committed far fewer crimes than American citizens. They often work in jobs that Americans avoid, such as picking crops, cleaning rooms in motels and hotels, cleaning dishes in restaurants, working in nursing homes, cleaning homes, and working in the garment industry. They work in jobs where insufficient numbers of citizens were available, such as construction. Some economists contend that they increase economic growth in the United States. They make scant use of American social programs other than schools, hospital emergency rooms, and birthing services whether because they were ineligible for them, feared their information might be divulged to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), did not know they were eligible for social programs, or simply did not want to use these services. With tens of millions of baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1960, about to retire, the United States needs to augment its workforce with younger people, such as immigrants. Insert 13.5. Critical Analysis: T rump’ s Betrayal of His Base of Support? LO 13-14 Discuss whether Trump’s support of either the House or Senate replacement proposals for the ACA betrayed his promises to white blue-collar persons considering that these proposals would have deprived many of them of health insurance? Recall that Trump had promised during the campaign not to cut Medicaid, but repeal of the ACA might prevent millions of persons from benefiting from the higher eligibility that the ACA funded in those states that chose to use it. Had the repeal version of the ACA passed the Senate, many white blue-collar people would have lost treatment for poisoning from opioid drugs that was prevalent among them. Many persons criticized Trump’s strategies for reducing the number of immigrants coming from Mexico. A wall extending from the Eastern border of Mexico with Texas to the West Coast of California would not only be expensive to build, but could be breeched with underground tunnels. Or immigrants could enter the United States by air and sea. Similar strategies could be used by drug cartels to breech the border. Trump also proposed mass deportation of immigrants from Mexico and Central America, implying that 12 million of them would be deported soon after he took office. Even some Republicans doubted the feasibility of this policy. Would the American public, they asked, tolerate the deportation of millions of families even if the nation had sufficient ICE staff to accomplish it? Mass deportation would have dire economic consequences for the United States because of the integral role of immigrants in the American economy. Could large-scale agricultural farms and companies in the Southwest, the South, and Florida operate without the labor of immigrants? Would not prices of agricultural products rise markedly without their labor? Don’t immigrants contribute to economic growth in the United States by filling jobs that most Americans would reject? Even talk of mass deportation had a destabilizing effect on immigrant communities in the United States. It caused the nation’s 12 million undocumented persons to panic in anticipation of raids on their homes. The American Civil Liberty Union (ACLU) as well as other allies of immigrants frantically informed immigrants of their legal rights, including their right not to discuss their immigration status with ICE personnel and local police. Mass deportation would almost certainly cause Mexico to take retaliatory measures. The Mexican government had already assumed an important role in slowing migration from Mexico to the United States, as well as the smuggling of drugs to the United States. It might cease efforts if Americans built a wall. Immigration experts opposed Trump’s desire to ban Muslim immigrants from seven Muslim nations: Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen in late January, 2017. They argued that the State Department had developed effective methods of vetting these immigrants to be certain that they were not terrorists—and produced statistics to demonstrate that no vetted refugees had committed terrorist acts. Aside from some terrorists who slammed airplanes into the World Tower on September 11, 2001, terrorism, they contended, was created by Muslim youth who had grown up in the United States and were citizens. They argued that the United States has often allowed refugees to enter the United States, such as Jews escaping the Nazis, persons escaping turmoil in World War II, persons escaping Russia, refugees created by the Vietnam War and conflict in Cambodia in the 1960s and 1970s, and refugees created by ISIS and civil wars in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Northern Africa in the last two decades. Many female refugees were admitted to the United States to escape domestic abuse and the sex trade over many decades. Many refugees fled religious persecution such as Christians persecuted by ISIS. African refugees have fled widespread starvation in the wake of droughts. In the fiscal year ending in September 2016, the United States had admitted 84,995 refugees from The Republic of the Congo, Syria, Burma, Iraq, and Somalia. Roughly 46% of these refugees were Muslim and 44% were Christian. President Obama chose to admit 38,901 Muslim refugees to the United States in FY 2016—or roughly half of the refugees admitted to the US in that year. They had experienced unspeakable atrocities and dangers as they escaped political upheavals in Syria that caused hundreds of thousands of them to flee to Turkey and many European nations. They often crossed the Mediterranean Sea in boats. Many people died in these perilous journeys as they sought sanctuary in Greece, Italy, France, Germany, and Spain. Even this number of admitted Muslim refugees was far smaller than numbers admitted by Scandinavian nations, Germany, France, Canada, and other nations. Banning Muslims could also cause negative consequences, many experts maintained. Might it help ISIS, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups recruit youth to their cause by allowing their recruiters to cite this ban as an example of prejudice of Americans against Muslims? It is not surprising, then, that immigration policies became a central issue during the presidential primaries and presidential campaign of 2015 and 2016, as well as the first months of the Trump presidency. Trump soon learned that Mexico would not pay for the Wall as Trump had promised. Many people who owned land near the border insisted they did not want the Wall built upon their land. Even some members of law enforcement at the border argued that the Wall would limit their vision of movements of immigrants on its Southern side. Trump ran into legal problems when he sought to limit Muslim migration to the United States. He issued an Executive Order on January 27, 2017, that banned entry for people from seven mostly Muslim nations for 90 days and halted admission of refugees for 120 days, arguing the ban was needed to “keep our country safe.” The Attorney General of the State of Washington immediately filed a lawsuit with a federal judge to place a stay on this ban on the grounds it discriminated against Muslims. When a federal judge ordered the stay, the administration appealed the stay to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco on grounds the President has the power to decide if immigration from these nations poses a threat to the nation’s national security. A panel of three judges held a hearing in the Ninth Circuit and seemed skeptical that the President had unlimited power to make this decision. The judges knew that recent terrorism in the United States in Orlando and San Bernardino came from Muslim persons raised in the United States rather than from the seven nations—and that the perpetrators of the destruction of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, had been born in Saudi Arabia which was not on the list of the seven nations. The judges also recalled that Trump had frequently asked for a ban on all Muslims during the campaign, suggesting he was biased against Moslems in general. Trump’s legal team tried to demonstrate that he was not biased because Trump had banned entry from mostly Muslim nations rather than Muslim people , but the judges didn’t buy this tactic and ruled the Executive Order to be unconstitutional. * A majority of American voters (or 51%) opposed the executive order, 60% opposed suspending all refugee programs, and 70% opposed barring Syrian refugees indefinitely. * Trump was furious, charging the judges with usurping his authority as president. Fearing the U.S. Supreme Court would not approve the Executive Order if the President appealed the Circuit Court’s decision to it, Trump’s advisors decided to draft another Executive Order that sought only a 90-day suspension of entry from six mostly Muslim nations after Iraq had been dropped from the list because the United States worked with Iraq to push ISIS from their nation. The new Order allowed case-by-case exceptions rather than a blanket order and deleted references to the Muslim religion. It also suspended the nation’s refugee program for 120 days and reduced the annual number of refugees from 120,000 to 50,000. * This new version was appealed to the Fourth and Ninth Circuits. The Fourth Circuit ruled against Trump’s Second Executive Order using language similar to the Ninth Circuit with respect to his First Executive Order. Attorney General Jeff Sessions immediately notified the general public that the Administration would appeal their ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. It was unclear if the replacement of the deceased Antonin Scalia by Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court by Trump would impact the Supreme Court’s decision on this case. He did finally receive support for a more modest ban on some immigrants from some Muslim nations from lower courts in fall 2017, but this ruling would likely be challenged in the Supreme Court. The legal status of so-called 800,000 “Dreamers” also came up during Trump’s first year in office. President Obama argued that Dreamers, brought to the United States as children by their undocumented parents, should not be deported. He tried unsuccessfully to get the Congress to pass The Dream Act that would have exempted them from deportation and allowed them a path to citizenship, so he issued an Executive Order that gave them the right to remain in the United States for two years if they were registered and fingerprinted by ICE and had not committed crimes. (The regulation was named Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.) Obama tried to persuade Trump just before he was inaugurated to show mercy to the Dreamers—and he reluctantly went along with Obama’s advice. The future of Dreamers remained uncertain by early January 2018. Trump wanted to bargain with some Democrats, such as hinging continuing protection of Dreamers in return for support of his proposed tax reforms, but Democratic leaders said they would not accede to Trump’s demand. * Trump did not engage in mass deportation of immigrants as he had promised in the campaign possibly because agricultural and corporate entities made known to him that they needed their labor. In the case of Dreamers and undocumented immigrants, it was unknown if Trump would change his mind—leaving immigrant communities in constant stress about their future. Trump and Attorney General Sessions had threatened to cut federal funds from so-called “sanctuary cities” such as Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, and New York that chose not to have their police forces collaborate with ICE, such as by informing ICE that they held specific immigrants in jails. Several federal judges ordered federal officials not to withhold funds from sanctuary cities. Why not, many experts asked, develop comprehensive immigration legislation that almost passed the Congress in 2007 with bipartisan support from Republicans George W. Bush and John McCain and Democrats like the late Edward Kennedy? Recall that Ronald Reagan had given millions of immigrants a path to citizenship in 1986 with bipartisan support. Why not give the roughly 12 million unauthorized immigrants currently in the United States a path to citizenship if they had not committed serious crimes —as well as the DOCA immigrants? Nor did Trump assertively seek humane policies to help hundreds of thousands of children and youth from Central American nations such as El Salvador in 2014 through 2016 seeking to reunite with family members in the United States or to escape poverty. Many of them rode trains from their nations through Mexico to reach the Southern border at great danger to themselves. They were mostly placed in makeshift quarters near the border in the United States with an uncertain future. Creating Jobs Trump promised jobs for white blue-collar Americans through four strategies: revising “unfair” trade treaties with other nations, promoting the mining and drilling of fossil fuels, rescinding climate control initiatives, and implementing a $1 trillion program to repair American infrastructure. LO 13-15 Revising Trade Treaties Trump accurately argued that neither major political party had focused on the economic needs of white blue-collar workers. Scores of cities and rural areas had lost manufacturing jobs from the 1960s to the present whose manufacturers had left for developing nations. These included manufacturers of automobiles, appliances, furniture, garments, consumer products, and pharmaceutical products. This exodus of jobs to other nations also harmed persons of color. Manufacturing plants had employed large numbers of African Americans in the 1950s, for example, but had mostly left the United States by the 1980s. Many of them left the United States to find cheaper and non-unionized labor in developing nations and to escape regulations in the United States that enhanced workers’ safety and that prohibited child labor. These companies had not had to pay tax or other penalties for leaving the United States—nor had most of them been offered tax and other incentives to remain in the United States. Trump implicated Mexico, China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam, as well as Germany as nations that had harmed American workers. He argued, as well, that China had used currency manipulations, such as devaluing her currency, to make their goods that were exported to the United States less expensive. Trump sometimes overstated foreign governments’ roles in inducing American companies to move abroad. Foreign manufacturing companies often based established manufacturing plants in the United States such as Toyota, Volkswagen, and Honda. Volkswagen plants employ roughly 8,000 persons in the United States, for example. When American plants moved abroad, such as automobile manufacturing plants to Mexico, they imported parts and technology from American plants. In other words, the exodus of plants to other nations often created exchanges of goods between the departed plants and American plants making it difficult to gauge the extent American nations or foreign nations received the most benefits. Moreover, nations that sign trade treaties often give concessions to other nations who have signed then, such as lower tariffs on their goods. Ominously, in the case of Obama’s proposed Trans-Pacific Treaty to link the United States to many Asian nations, these Asian nations decided to move ahead without U.S. participation—possibly reducing imports from the United States and allowing China to expand its huge exports to other Asian nations. Trump assumed that repealing or revising trade treaties would be panaceas. It is, in fact, difficult to lure manufacturing plants back into the United States unless American labor and other costs are markedly reduced. It wouldn’t be possible to cut the minimum wages of many states and the federal government, such as California, that planned to move its minimum wage to $15 by 2022. Nor could American work-safety laws be overturned —which often did not exist or were not enforced in some developing nations. Trump failed to recognize, as well, that companies that returned to the United States would likely employ a fraction of the workers in their foreign plants if they reduced their labor costs in the United States by replacing many workers with robots and electronics—possibly more than halving their labor forces. Economists predict that employment of many kinds of American workers will be endangered by electronics, including truck drivers, taxi drivers, workers in all kinds of manufacturing plants, workers in warehouses, and check-out clerks in grocery stores. Trump failed to discuss what might happen if other trading nations believed Trump meant to take advantage of them by revising existing treaties, such as by proposing trade policies that would harm them. Why wouldn’t the Mexican government slap tariffs on American goods if he placed them on Mexican goods? Trump knew that white blue-collar workers often had only high-school degrees, yet he failed to identify a strategy for increasing their technical skills or helping more of them get college degrees. Were they to get jobs in manufacturing plants that returned from other nations, they would need to upgrade their skills and their general levels of education. To his credit, Trump convinced some companies to enlarge their American production. He convinced some others not to leave the country. He convinced the company that manufactures Apple i-phones in China to establish plants in Wisconsin. He hoped to cut corporate federal tax rates to induce American companies to stay in the United States. Yet these accomplishments did not rise to the level of his campaign promises to revive economic growth in areas where white blue-collar workers resided. By December 2017, Trump has not revised NAFTA. Promoting Fossil Fuels and Cutting Environmental Protections Many Trump supporters came from “coal country” in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Ohio. Yet others came from areas with large amounts of oil and gas in the Midwest and the Mountain states. It is not surprising that people in coal country supported Trump, particularly after Hillary Clinton remarked in a speech in West Virginia that she wanted the coal industry to disappear due to its negative impact on the environment. In fairness, she quickly retracted this statement. Trump contended that climate-control policies were responsible for the loss of jobs in the United States—and particularly jobs in coal country. He believed that regulations on the coal industry and factories reduced their profits and employment. It is true: the coal industry was in marked decline by 2015, but its decline was caused by other factors, such as the remarkable resurgence of other forms of energy that spewed less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere including natural gas, as well as renewable sources of wind turbines and solar panels. Natural gas was cheaper than coal partly because drillers had discovered huge amounts by “fracking” that forced it to the surface by injecting water under high pressure into subterranean strata to release embedded natural gas. Not only was natural gas less toxic to the environment, but it was also far cheaper than coal. Coal mining in Eastern and Midwestern states, often obtained in underground mines, had to compete with cheaper coal from Montana and Wyoming that was mined from surface deposits. Trump tweeted in his presidential campaign that climate control was a hoax promoted by the Chinese, but provided no data to support this claim. Scientists have obtained data that demonstrates that global temperatures are rising sufficiently to contribute to the melting of glaciers around the globe, as well as ice in the Arctic and Antarctic due to world-wide emissions of carbon dioxide with the largest share coming from the United States over many decades. Many scientists argue that climate warming contributes to rising numbers of tornados and other severe weather events, droughts. They contend it has negative impacts on crops and animals in diverse locations. Trump failed to acknowledge that climate control may not slow economic growth. California’s economy has grown more rapidly than most states even though it has vigorously promoted climate-control policies. The manufacturing and exports of solar panels and wind turbines have provided hundreds of thousands of jobs, nationwide, including more jobs in Massachusetts, alone, than all the coal-mining jobs in the United States. Climate-control jobs also include installing insulation in homes and businesses, development of energy-efficient furnaces and air conditioners, and manufacturing and installing energy-efficient roofs and windows. Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accord on June 1, 2017, reflected promises he had made during his campaign. He made this decision despite considerable opposition within the White House, including from his Secretary of State (Rex Tillerson) and his daughter. Trump supported rescinding of scores of regulations put in place by former presidents to protect the environment by Scott Pruitt, his appointed administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Stephen Bannon, his chief strategist, applauded the anti-climate policies of Trump and Pruitt. No other nations followed suit, leaving 197 nations in the Paris Accord by November 2017. Many American cities, states, and corporations pledged to honor agreements reached by the nations in the Accord and to take the lead in protecting the environment despite the actions of Trump and Pruitt. Repairing America’ s Infrastructure America’s infrastructure is in dire straits with tens of thousands of antiquated bridges, roads, airports, ports, and railroads, even as China, Japan, and many European nations have invested more heavily in their infrastructure than the United States. Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure program not just to improve this infrastructure but to provide many jobs. It was unclear by fall 2017 how Trump would obtain resources for this large program because he placed only $20 billion in his initial budget proposal. (Hillary Clinton had promised a $1 trillion infrastructure package.) Nor was it clear how this massive infrastructure program would employ white blue- collar people in rural areas. Not only were they geographically distant from many possible work sites, but they also often lacked technical skills and education to work in these projects. Unlike many work-relief programs in the New Deal where workers used shovels and wheelbarrows, contemporary infrastructure repairs require workers with technical skills in using earth-moving equipment, constructing buildings, and designing bridges. The nation already has many construction firms, often with their own workers, who receive large government contracts—possibly leaving white blue-collar workers in rural areas in the lurch. Trump’s real estate experience had equipped him to oversee construction of large buildings rather than a mix of projects that include highways, bridges, airports, water systems, drainage systems, and railroads. He had not yet announced his infrastructure proposal by December 2017. Trump’ s Budget and T ax Priorities EP 3b The best indicator of Trump’s intentions are his budget and tax priorities. If he wanted to help relatively poor members of the United States, including blue-collar whites, he would have to change the budget and tax policies of the United States to reflect this priority. He might decide, for example, to increase federal funding for safety-net programs, job-training, opioid counseling, and other social programs. He might decide to cut the taxes of the middle class, as he often promised in the campaign—and to sustain funding of Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. Were he to pursue the opposite course, he risked betraying his base of support. Recall that Trump already had supported versions of the ACA that would have taken health insurance from between 20 million and 23 million people —most of them relatively poor people—even though he failed to repeal the ACA in the House and the Senate. His preliminary budget was not promising when Mick Mulvaney, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, issued the outlines of the president’s budget proposal on May 23, 2017. He proposed deep cuts in Medicaid in his budget even though Trump promised in his campaign not to cut Medicaid, used by roughly 80 million low-income people of all races. He proposed deep cuts in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or Food Stamps) used by roughly 42 million persons. LO 13-16 The priorities of the Republican Party and President Trump became clearer when the House and Senate approved budget resolutions in fall 2017 that proposed roughly $1.5 trillion in deficits for the coming fiscal year. The Senate proposed trillions of dollars of spending cuts in the coming decade, including $1 trillion from Medicaid and $470 million from Medicare. The House budget resolution also proposed deep cuts in spending, but proposed not to add to the deficit. Republicans raced to get their budget resolutions enacted so that they could enact before Christmas their tax legislation to fund their proposed budget. The House enacted its tax proposals in mid- November with no consultation with Democrats. It proposed tax cuts that give the largest benefits to affluent Americans. It proposed, for example, to eliminate taxes on estates —a measure that would reward Trump’s offspring with $1 billion in the aftermath of his death. It repealed the Alternative Minimum Tax that ensured affluent people pay at least some tax, giving large tax breaks to persons earning between $200,000 and $1 million. It proposed massive breaks to corporations by lowering the corporate tax rates from 35% to 20% while not making these reductions conditional upon them raising their workers’ wages, improving their job training, or making job-creating investments. Most experts agreed: the corporations will raise dividends and fund stock buy-backs for affluent people who own their stocks. It disallowed people in states that funded many social programs to write off the state taxes that fund these programs from their federal income taxes. This proposal could lead California, New York, Illinois, and other big- spending states to cut their social and educational programs by cutting support for them by affluent persons, possibly even causing some of them to move their businesses to states with low spending on social programs. * Removal of this tax deduction would favor so-called Red States over Blue States since more high-income people live in Blue States and help to fund their social programs. * The House version would “harm many middle class and low-income families in the short term and the vast majority of families in the long run.” * The Tax Policy Center estimated that the House version would give 48% of its benefits to the richest 1% of the population. * Some positive features in the House bill did impose greater taxes on affluent people, including capping mortgage-interest deductions only for mortgages under $500,000 rather than $1 million, but the bulk of its provisions favored affluent people. The Senate moved to develop its own set of tax cuts by early November 2017. Its choices were similar to the House version on many counts—again favoring wealthy individuals and corporations rather than middle- and moderate-income persons. On a positive note, it doubled the child tax credit, but both the House and Senate versions let the tax cuts on middle-class families expire by 2025 while allowing corporate tax cuts to remain. Both the House and Senate versions will create roughly $1.4 trillion in additional budget deficits during the next 10 years according to the Congressional Budget Office—just as occurred from the Reagan and George W. Bush tax cuts. Interest payments on the national debt, already large, will increase further. If a Democrat becomes president in 2020, she or he will have scant resources to reverse the spending cuts of Trump for Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP, and other social programs that, paradoxically, white blue-collar persons use extensively. If their tax cuts do not promote economic growth as Republicans and Trump promise, then the temptation to cut big-ticket programs like Social Security and Medicare will grow in addition to already -proposed huge cuts in Medicaid. * It was too soon to know, in late November, whether Republicans would obtain the votes needed to enact the Senate version of tax reform and then to get it through a Conference Committee to reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions. Professor Lily Batchelder of New York University contends that by 2027 the only income group that will benefit from the Senate bill on average will be the top 1%, leaving the bottom 99%, on average, worse off. * A Quinnipac poll found in late November that only 16% of Americans believed the tax bill would reduce their taxes. The House and Senate resolved their differences in their tax bills and sent their legislation to President Trump who signed it in late December, 2017. It gave far more benefits to affluent Americans and corporations than to middle and working-class Americans. It also repealed the mandate of the ACA that required everyone to purchase health insurance. Polls indicated that the legislation was disliked by most Americans. Race and Ideology Polarize the United States A series of events polarized the United States in August 2017 in and after racial and ideological conflict in Charlottesville, Virginia. Prior events in South Carolina set the stage. The Governor and legislature of South Carolina had removed the confederate flag from their Statehouse in 2015 because many residents found it objectionable in a public place. Then a white male, who called himself a “white supremacist,” shocked the nation by killing nine African Americans in a South Carolina church in 2015—a man sentenced to the death penalty by a jury. A photograph of him with a confederate flag was highly publicized. These events catalyzed a debate about Confederate symbols across Southern states, where hundreds of statues of generals and soldiers from the Confederacy were prominently displayed. These statues, placed throughout the South in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, were meant to intimidate the South’s large African American population. Controversy shifted to Charlottesville, Virginia, where the City Council decided to remove the Lee Statue from its public place by selling it to a private party. On May 13, 2017, a group of persons wielding torches, protested plans to remove the statute of confederate General Robert E. Lee chanting, “You will not replace us, Russia is our friend, and Blood and soil.” This group was led by a prominent white nationalist who popularized the phrase “alt-right” and who sought an “ethno-state” that would be a “safe space for white people.” The mayor of Charlottesville criticized these demonstrators, contending they wanted to frighten minorities “in a way that hearkens back to the days of the KKK.” The Chairman of the Charlottesville Republican Party also condemned them as “utterly disgusting and disturbing beyond words.” The controversy escalated when a Republican contender for the race for the Governorship of Virginia pledged he would prevent the Lee statue, as well as other Confederate Statues, from LO 13-17 being removed. A judge agreed to a temporary injunction that blocked Charlottesville City Council from selling the Lee statute for six months. * Conflict further escalated on July 19th when 15 members of the KKK rallied in Charlottesville to protest the city’s plan to remove the Lee statue, some wearing white robes and carrying Confederate flags, only to be outnumbered by 1000 of counter protesters that shouted “racists go home.” * Now the stage was set for extreme conflict in Charlottesville when groups representing “white supremacists,” Alt-Right, National Socialist (Nazi or fascist), and KKK members, mounted a demonstration against the removal of the Lee statue at Emancipation Park on August 12, 2017. They came into town in a quasi-military formation with a network of commanders and leaders, numbering between 2000 and 6000 persons. They carried weapons and shields decorated with Nazi Swastikas, World Wheels, Aryan Crosses, and anti-Semitic messages. A counter protest of progressive activists formed that included students from the University of Virginia as well as some members of fringe groups that wanted the statue removed. Many witnesses contend that members of the white supremacist groups took the offensive. A white male drove a car into members of the counter demonstration, killing a 32-year-old white woman and injuring 19 other people. Two policemen perished when their surveillance helicopter crashed. The driver of the car was arrested and ultimately charged with second degree murder, as well as some members of the white supremacist and allied groups. Many witnesses observed that the white supremacists and allied groups took the offensive against the progressive activists with minimal protection from the Virginia State Police. All eyes turned toward the White House as the press and many Americans awaited condemnation of the white supremacists and their allies. President Trump initially condemned racism and violence when he said on the morning of August 12, “we all must be united and condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Let’s come together as one.” At 3:34 p.m. on August 12, he said: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ” (author’s italics). This additional phrase led many onlookers to think he thought “hatred, bigotry, and violence” occurred (more or less) equally on both sides when onlookers viewed the white supremacists and their allies as the initiators. He refused to respond to an inquiry from ABC news as to whether he supported white nationalist groups. At 10:31 a.m. on August 13, a White House spokesperson affirmed his statement on the afternoon of August 12, saying “he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neoNazi and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.” On August 14, he reaffirmed the content of the preceding statement, ending it with “We must love each other, show affection for each other, and together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence.” Had his statements ended here, he would mostly have been praised for his response, but he gave a controversial press conference on August 15 where he blamed both sides of the protestors for the conflict, adding there were “very fine people” in both the group of white supremacists and white nationalists as well as among the counterprotestors. He continued, “I think there is blame on both sides. You look at both sides. I think there is blame on both sides.” * This statement threw the nation into turmoil. How could the President, many people asked, equate white supremacists, the KKK, white nationalists, and neo-Nazi groups with counter-protestors that merely wanted to support removal of the Lee statue? Trump stated in another Tweet that the statues should be retained to preserve the beauty of Southern towns. He also argued that removal of Confederate Generals’ statues might lead to the removal of statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson because they had owned slaves, as if Washington’s and Jefferson’s work in forming the new nation was comparable to Confederate Generals’ treasonous efforts to destroy the union. Trump poured gas on the fire on August 22 in Phoenix when he again stated that he condemned “in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of bigotry and violence, “on both sides.” The pivotal nature of Charlottesville became clear in its aftermath. Trump had to dissolve two advisory groups of business executives that he had established to give him guidance about economic affairs because most of them resigned to protest his comments. The Charlottesville controversy triggered misgivings about Trump’s fitness to hold office. General James Clapper, who had worked at high levels for numerous presidents, believed he was not fit to be president due to his mercurial nature and lack of policy knowledge, even doubting he should have access to the nuclear codes. Republican Senator Bob Corker doubted his fitness for office. A group of Jewish rabbis cancelled their annual visit to the President for his support of bigotry against Jews. Members of the Presidential Arts Council cancelled their membership. Eighteen charitable organizations cancelled meetings at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Resort, including the American Red Cross. Pressure mounted on evangelicals, ministers, and Trump’s fellow Republicans to speak out against the President’s words. Corie Robertson, Star of Duck Dynasty, joined other celebrities who had voted for Trump in denouncing his Charlottesville comments and his support of the Confederate statues. The heads of the five branches of the military unequivocally condemned white supremacy in the wake of Charlottesville. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that the President speaks for himself when he discusses ethical matters. Trump doubled down on August 25 when he pardoned Sheriff Arpaio, who had been convicted of racial profiling of Latinos in Arizona, such as rounding up large groups of Latinos who were mostly citizens. Trump continued his vendetta against Obama by tweeting a white image of Trump overlaid over a dark picture of Obama, calling it “a total eclipse.” Trump’s propensity for discrimination against at-risk populations was also manifested by his decision to support Ray Moore for a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate in November 2017. Moore was accused of numerous incidents of sexual harassment of female teenagers as young as age 14—and had a long record of attacking the LGBTQ and African American communities. Trump feared that the loss of the seat to Democrat Doug Jones might imperil passage of his tax reform measures in late 2017. Many leading Republicans in the Congress and the nation wanted Moore to withdraw from the race, as did all the leading Alabama newspapers. Trump insisted that Moore was innocent because, afterall, he denied the pedophilia charges. Hurricanes Harvey , Irma, and Maria Hurricane Harvey developed into a Category 2 hurricane on the morning of August 25, soon devastating communities on the South Texas and Southwest Louisiana coast over many days. The magnitude of the hurricane, its slow movement over land, and the sheer amount of rain caused destruction and flooding that inundated large amounts of Houston, Beaumont, Port Arthur, and many other towns. Remarkable levels of heroism ensued as thousands of volunteers, first responders, and member of the U.S. military rescued people from their homes. Some commentators speculated that this hurricane might bring major changes to Texas in coming years. It highlighted the need for social programs and public spending. The Trump Administration had proposed huge cuts in the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) prior to the hurricane, but would now have to fund possibly more than $100 billion in reconstruction costs. The nation viewed persons of different races, ideologies, and religions working together to save lives. Much as the effort to cast more than 20 million persons from health insurance earlier in the year had led to protests in the Town Hall meetings of many Republicans, lawmakers would face similar protests if they failed to fully fund and implement a gigantic and ongoing relief effort that would help residents find safe housing, repair their homes, get necessary relief, and obtain flood control infrastructure to avert further catastrophes. To the credit of the Trump Administration and Texas authorities, no one was excluded from life-saving measures, food, shelter, and medical care in the immediate wake of the hurricane, even several hundred thousand undocumented persons. Moving forward, however, this Administration and these authorities would have to decide whether to help these undocumented persons. If they were not helped and deported, thousands of Texas LO 13-18 agricultural and business entities, already facing economic problems in the wake of the storm, might lose many valued employees. Many Republican Congressmen had opposed the funding of relief for victims of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey in the Obama Administration, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. With the table reversed, however, they joined hands with Democrats to fully fund relief for Texans. The nation soon experienced two other major hurricanes: Irma and Maria that, between them, devastated small Caribbean islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and South Carolina. The Federal Emergency Administration, working with state and territorial governments, did commendable emergency work—with the exception of Puerto Rico, where relief was belated and inadequate. It posed formidable obstacles to relief, such as its location at a considerable distance from the mainland, but President Trump seemed more interested in arguing with its local Latino/a leaders than with restoring drinkable water and electricity. The delayed response to Puerto Rico could, paradoxically, boomerang against Trump and Republicans because tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans—all U.S. citizens—fled to Florida where they could vote for Democrats in 2018 and 2000, possibly swinging it to the Democrats. * Sexual Harassment and Mass Murders Sexual harassment in places of work, mostly against women, had long been a problem in the United States, but it had often not led to penalties for perpetrators. Sometimes the victims feared to come forward for fear of reprisals or were ashamed to reveal incidents. They were sometimes offered monetary settlements, sometimes on the condition that they not divulge the offender. A surge of women accusing men of sexual harassment began with allegations against high officials and reporters at FOX News including Roger Ailes, its former chairman, and Bill O’Reilly, its cable news host. They respectively paid $40 million and $25 million to accusers to keep them silent. Many women accused Harvey Weinstein, a Hollywood mogul, of sexual harassment, many of those victims were also kept silent with monetary rewards. Women accused at least 39 prominent men in entertainment, news media, politics, finance, and business executives of sexual harassment in ensuing months. Sexual harassment had long existed in the nation’s political institutions including Bill Clinton’s affair with student intern Monica Lewinsky in his second term. It surfaced more recently when Roy Moore, a hard-right former judge, decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat (from Alabama) that had been vacated by Jeff Sessions when President Trump named him to be his Attorney General. No sooner had he announced his candidacy than four women accused him of sexually harassing them as teenagers—to be followed by other women. He chose not to exit the race even as widespread reports surfaced that he had roamed malls in search of teenagers decades ago. President Trump, himself accused of sexually harassing many women during his political campaign, encountered a dilemma. If he asked Moore to exit the race, he may have resurfaced charges by many women during his campaign that he had sexually abused them prior to his campaign and when a tape was released where he discussed how he sexually harassed women. He risked losing a Republican in the U.S. Senate just when he needed every possible LO 13-19 Republican vote to pass tax legislation. Having decided not to tell Moore to withdraw from the race for the vacant Senate seat, he encountered another dilemma when two women accused Democratic Senator Al Franken of sexual harassment in late November 2017. When Trump attacked him, reporters accused him of hypocritically not attacking Moore and for not responding to charges by more than 10 women who accused him of sexually harassing them in prior decades. Several additional Democratic politicians resigned from their posts when charged with sexual harassment. At least four Democratic women in the Senate were positioned to run for the presidency in 2020 including Kirsten Gillebrand, Kamal Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren. The epidemic of mass murders that had bedeviled President Obama continued during Trump’s presidency with 307 mass shootings from January 1, 2017 to November 5, 2017 when four or more people were killed in the same locations. They were supplemented by other mass killings, such as a home-grown Muslim terrorist who ran into bike riders in New York. They included the killing of scores of people in Las Vegas by a white man with unknown motivation, as well as the mass killing of 26 parishioners in a Baptist Church in Summerland Springs, Texas, by a man seeking revenge against his estranged wife’s family. They were preceded by the killing of more than 50 people in a gay bar in Orlando, Florida, by a home-grown Muslim terrorist in 2016. Trump blamed slayings on terrorists from abroad or from persons with mental illness, but was wrong on both counts. Aside from the destruction of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, that was plotted and executed by residents of Saudi Arabia, American terrorist acts are committed by home- grown American citizens descended from Muslim immigrants. Some mass killings are perpetuated by persons with mental illness, such as the killing of children, teachers, and administrators at Newtown, Connecticut. But other mass killings take place for a variety of reasons that cannot be attributed to diagnosed mental illness. Americans need to realize that mass killings are largely an American phenomenon. If the United States has 5% of the world’s population, it has 31% of all public mass killings. * If the United States had 90 mass shootings between 1966 and 2012, the Philippines, the next closest nation, had 18, following by Russia with 15, Yemen with 11, and France with 10. American shootings occurred mostly in businesses (46%) and schools (24%) between 2000 and 2013. American civilians own enough guns (270 million) to arm every adult, making it the nation with the most guns in the world. If 71% of gun owners say their firearm(s) are essential to their freedom, only 31% of nongun owners believe gun owners need them to protect their freedom. These data strongly suggest that the sheer abundance of guns promotes mass killings because scores of nations with fewer guns have virtually no mass slayings as compared to the United States. * Many other variables do not correlate with mass shootings in different nations, including racial diversity, the extent citizens play video games, prevalence of mental illness as measured by rates of suicide, and crime rates. Mass shootings increase as nations have more guns in the general population. Many perpetrators of mass slayings in the United States possess highly lethal firearms, such as machine guns or guns outfitted with devices that allow them to fire huge numbers of bullets rapidly. It is not surprising, then, that American mass shootings are far more destructive than those in other nations where these lethal weapons are not widely available. Citizens in only three nations believe that people have an inherent right to own guns: Mexico, Guatemala, and the United States. This culture makes it far more difficult to regulate guns as compared to Britain and Australia that moved quickly to regulate the number and kind of guns available to citizens in the wake of mass shootings in 1987 and 1996. Even in the wake of the mass slaying of children at Sandy Hook, the U.S. Senate chose not to regulate guns despite President Obama’s advocacy for gun regulation. Those who seek gun regulation pinned their hopes on a law suit brought before the Connecticut Supreme Court to hold the companies that manufactured military assault weapons responsible for the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School. * Warning Signs for the T rump Movement Trump was under attack by early December 2017 from many directions— from the Congress, FBI Director Robert Mueller, and political opposition. FBI Director Robert Mueller, as well as various Congressional committees, investigated charges that his campaign colluded with the Russians and that he wrongly sought to use his presidency to enhance his wealth or committed tax evasion prior to his presidency. A woman who claimed he had sexually harassed her appeared close to receiving a decision from a judge to hear her case. Mueller investigated to see if Trump engaged in obstruction of justice. Six Democratic members of Congress introduced articles of impeachment. Trump had retained the allegiance of his core supported from the Rust Belt according to many polls during his first year in office. Many of them had decided not to abandon him even though they realized that he had not enacted any significant measures that improved their economic condition. Many of them chose to settle for his attacks on political elites and his America-First ideology. * Yet Republicans and Trump received mostly bad news in statewide elections in Virginia and New Jersey on November 8. It was “largely a suburban rebellion,” where many suburban voters rejected Trump and supported Democrats. Democrats won the governorships in both states. They took control of Virginia’s House of Delegates. So-called independent voters, not affiliated with either party, swung toward Democrats. * Many independent voters disliked Trump’s use of Tweets—and were also bothered by the many scandals and investigations plaguing Trump. * Yet Democrats did not do well in areas with white blue-collar voters, who mostly still supported Trump. A Quinnipiac survey taken in mid November found that only 40% of registered voters believed Trump was fit for office —although responses were strongly linked to respondents’ political party. If LO 13-20 93% of Democrats viewed him as unfit to serve, only 14% of Republicans held this view. * Rumblings had begun to impeach Trump among some Democrats by mid- November 2017. * They would need to gain control of the House in the 2018 election to begin impeachment proceedings—and the Senate in 2020 assuming they were unable to persuade some Republicans to join the effort. “Friendly persuasion” seemed not to be an option on either side of the ideological divide. Both sides wanted to control Congress and win the presidency at the ballot box—and both sides planned to spend inordinate money to gain dominance in upcoming elections in 2018 and 2020. Both sides planned to contest local and state elections—and Democrats sought to take back seats gained by Republicans during Obama’s presidency. Democrats have assets of their own. They, too, have big donors. They have core supporters who gave Clinton three million voters more than Trump, including persons of color; millennial persons; members of trade unions that did not migrate to Trump; intellectuals; Jews; persons with college education, suburban residents; and workers in the technology firms. Trump had antagonized many members of the Democrats’ base of support including African Americans, Latinos, women, disabled people, and other vulnerable populations. Persons from these groups will probably be more likely to vote in the pivotal elections of 2018 and 2020 than in prior years. Social W orkers as Policy Advocates EP 5c Trump’s attacks on vulnerable populations clearly violate NASW’s Code of Ethics. Many of his policy choices also harmed these populations, such as immigration bans, projected cuts in safety-net programs, his willingness to deprive as many as 23 million persons from health insurance when seeking to repeal and replace the ACA, possible cuts in entitlements, policies on the climate, failure to respond as rapidly to hurricane damage in Puerto Rico as compared to Texas and Florida in fall 2017, his support of Ray Moore for the U.S. Senate despite a record of sexually harassing teenage girls, and proposed tax reforms that favor affluent people in a nation with extreme income inequality. His use of bullying violates commonly accepted ethical standards. Social workers are committed to fighting climate change that Trump had rejected when he took the nation out of the Paris Climate Accord and when he rescinded many regulations that cut pollution. Many social workers were members of “the resistance” by joining marches and attending town hall meetings of legislators. Many social workers will likely work to elect candidates in 2018 and 2020 with views consonant with their Code of Ethics from either political party or third parties. His indiscriminate attack on mass media violates the constitutional right of free speech. We can disagree about specific policies of Trump. We can criticize specific news accounts. But we cannot avoid criticizing policies that clearly violate professional ethics. We should oppose policies of Democrats when they violate the Code of Ethics, including when they, too, fail to honor evidence- based policies. Roughly 450 social workers currently hold public office LO 13-21 ranging from local school boards to the U.S. Senate. Many more should consider running for office. Social work advocates can develop four documents: Policy advocacy background documents that place a specific social problem in their historical context—documents that orient contemporary stakeholders to a specific social problem or issue so that they can better address it. Op-Ed articles that can be submitted to a newspaper or other publication. They are relatively short, such as one page—and must, meet the length requirements of specific newspapers. Letters to the Editor that advocate for specific policies A 2–3-page “policy brief” that describes a specific policy proposal to address a specific social problem or issue with supplemental materials in an appendix. It is presented to public officials or funders. Unlike a paper that places a policy in its historical perspective or op-ed articles that educate the general public, policy briefs propose specific policies or programs to public officials or funders. Visit the MindTap to read “Developing Policy Advocacy Background Documents, Op-Ed Articles, Letters to the Editor, and Policy Briefs.” Understand the Evolution of the Reluctant Welfare State The American welfare state has survived many threats in prior decades, such as deep funding cuts. It is unknown what impact the Trump Administration will have on it after only one year in office. The outcomes of the 2018 and 2020 elections will determine whether the current stalemate continues or changes as one side or the other gains a decisive advantage. LO 13-22 What W e Can Learn from Policy Advocates in the Trump Presidency Policy advocates who organized and participated in marches and protests effectively made clear that substantial numbers of people did not accept Trump’s positions on immigration, the ACA, tax and budget priorities, climate change, and civil rights. Efforts by Black Lives Matter led some local officials to enact regulations that placed constraints on police departments. Persons who dislike Trump’s and Republicans’ policies need to build a strong counter-movement that has three major components. * It must develop and use culture power with a new vision that includes seeking to reduce extreme economic inequality that currently exceeds levels in 20 industrialized nations. * This culture power must also include the honoring of diversity in marked contrast to attacks on at-risk populations during the Trump presidency. It must have “disruptive power” by using demonstrations such as have already had effect when reformers attended town hall meetings of Republicans when they sought to repeal and replace Obamacare. It must have “power through organizing” through community and electoral levels. Persons who failed to turn out to vote in 2010, 2014, and 2016 have to be persuaded that their voices and votes count. LO 13-23 What W e Can Learn from the Persistence of Unmet Needs during the T rump Presidency Many Americans were startled to hear from a French economist, Thomas Piketty, in a book published in 2014, that the United States had the same level of economic inequality in the present period as during the Gilded Age following the American Civil War. * The wages of American workers had hardly budged for four decades, while the incomes of affluent persons had greatly increased. This income disparity meant that people in the bottom 50% of the nation’s economy lived paycheck to paycheck, while persons in the upper economic echelons often lived in mansions and gated communities. These economic facts suggested that the United States needed a new reform period that uplifted ordinary people, while increasing taxes on super-affluent Americans. The controversy about the ACA revealed that many millions of Americans would need public subsidies for their health care, whether through Medicaid, the ACA insurance subsidies, or other sources. The nation would have to decide whether to move toward larger programs, such as Medicare for All, in coming years. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria may be a prelude to other environmental crises if climate change causes more and extreme natural disasters. Americans will likely have to rejoin the global effort to avert climate change. LO 13-24 What W e Can Learn from Failed Policy Strategies of the T rump Presidency Trump’s attacks on vulnerable populations clearly violate NASW’s Code of Ethics. Many of his policy choices also harmed them, such as immigration bans, projected cuts in safety-net programs, and rescinding the military’s plans to allow trans-gender persons to serve in the military. Social workers are committed to fighting the climate change that Trump had rejected when he took the nation out of the Paris Climate Accord. LO 13-25 What W e Can Learn from Promising Strategies of the T rump Presidency Trump identified a vulnerable population that had mostly been ignored by political elites: white blue-collar persons in rural and semirural areas. He identified the need to revise some trade treaties to reduce incentives for manufacturing companies to exit the United States. He discussed the need to repair the nation’s infrastructure even though he had not yet developed a strategy in late 2017. Some provisions of pending budget and tax legislation are meritorious, such as capping the size of mortgage interest payments that can be deducted from income taxes even if most experts, including the Congressional Budget Office, contend that these provisions mostly helped corporations and affluent Americans. But he failed to find solutions to the problems of white blue-collar persons, even advocating policies that might harm them, such as supporting health plans that could cause more than 20 million Americans to lose health insurance, cutting safety-net programs like SNAP, and cutting Medicaid. Insert 13.6. Critical Analysis: Could T rump Have Fulﬁlled His Campaign Promise to Help both Blue-Collar Whites and Persons of Color? Donald Trump promised during his campaign that he would also help African Americans who, after all, he said, had many of the same social problems as blue-collar whites. He often talked disparagingly and inaccurately about neighborhoods of African Americans, describing them as riddled with crime and drugs—prompting Michelle Obama to say that her Chicago neighborhood has many strengths. Could Trump have identified social policies that would have helped both LO 13-26 populations? Take a stab at identifying possible policies in liaison with others.

Students will learn in this chapter to: Decide whether the contemporary welfare state is morally flawed Examine other moral flaws of the American welfare state Analyze cultural factors Discuss economic factors Discuss institutional factors Explore social factors Understand the sequence of events Understand reluctance as the outcome of numerous factors Identify redeeming moral features of the American welfare state LO 14-10 LO 14-11 LO 14-12 LO 14-13 Critique conservatives’ case against the American welfare state Evaluate contextual factors that have promoted enactment of social reforms Recognize the journey toward policy practice and policy advocacy Understand how to move beyond history to policy advocacy in contemporary society Introduction In this chapter we will explore the following questions: Is the American welfare state ethically flawed as it now exists? To the extent that the American welfare state possesses characteristics that are both ethically troublesome and meritorious, how did the two- sided context of social policy in the United States contribute to this seemingly contradictory result? Do contemporary social workers possess ethical responsibilities similar to those of Americans in prior historical eras? What lessons can we learn from policy advocates who have preceded us? At the end of this chapter, we will discuss what you can do in contemporary society to make the American welfare state more humane—following in the footsteps of thousands of policy advocates who have preceded you during the more than 200 years that it took the American welfare state to evolve to its present condition. Recall that we discussed at the end of Chapter 13 how social workers can develop policy background papers, letters to the editor, op-ed essays, and policy briefs. Decide whether the Contemporary W elfare State Is Morally Flawed EP 2a An excellent case can be made that the contemporary American welfare state is morally flawed—and also has many morally redeeming features. This ethically ambiguous nature of the American welfare state suggests that we—just like citizens of prior eras—have to decide what is right and what is wrong, as indicated by circle 1 of Figure 2.1 . We will begin by discussing ethical flaws in the contemporary welfare state and then proceed to some of its ethically redeeming features later in this chapter. LO 14-1 Manifestations of Reluctance As summarized in Insert 14.1 , we can identify eight manifestations of reluctance that distinguish the American welfare state from that of most industrialized nations. * Insert 14.1.

Even when domestic expenditures of local, state, and federal authorities are aggregated, Americans devote (and have devoted at least since World War II) a relatively smaller share of their GDP to domestic spending than many other industrialized nations. As can be seen in Figure 14.1 , American public spending averaged less than 40% of its GDP from 1987 through 2005 as compared with average spending far in excess of 40% for Belgium and the European Union (EU) member countries for the same years. * (Even the United Kingdom, whose domestic budgets were slashed during the conservative rule of Margaret Thatcher, spent a considerably larger share of GDP than the United States.) The data in Figure 14.1 have not changed significantly since 2005, although American social spending is significantly augmented by so-called “tax expenditures, such as tax credits, deductions, and exemptions that are not included in “public spending.”) Figure 14.1.

Most nations provide a combination of universal programs, which deliver services or benefits to people regardless of their income, and means-tested programs, which can be used only by people who fall beneath specific levels of income. Although many European nations offer a range of universal programs, the United States places more emphasis upon means-tested programs. Only elderly Americans benefit from anything resembling universal health care, through the Medicare program—and even this program fails to cover long-term care and many specific services. Unlike most European nations, the United States does not provide a children’s allowance to families but does provide a less generous children’s tax credit that was made more generous in 2018 by making it available to persons who are exempt from federal income taxes because their income is so low—and restricts publicly funded child care to persons who meet specific income tests. In some European nations, housing programs, vacation subsidies, and even sabbaticals for many occupations are not means-tested. * 3. Whille European welfare programs are relatively stable, their American counterparts are subject to considerable volatility or uncertainty. New Deal public works programs, the National Youth Administration, many programs of the War on Poverty, and various housing programs have been terminated. Fluctuations in program funding are endemic: Various New Deal programs underwent drastic cuts, the funding of many Great Society programs was cut in the late 1960s, and mental health centers and a variety of means-tested programs for the poor suffered deep cuts during the administrations of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. Liberal reformers have often found their legislative successes attacked in subsequent conservative periods, such as the 1920s, the 1950s, the 1980s, the first year of Trump’s presidency, and the 1990s. Although actual spending on many social programs has not diminished, the same is not true for others; for example, many programs that helped low- income people were slashed during the 1980s and during the presidencies of Obama and Trump. Even when cuts were not made, threats to reduce domestic spending have often forced American reformers to devote considerable effort to maintaining existing funding such as during the presidency of Trump. Flux has occurred in European nations, as well—for example, many had conservative regimes of their own during the 1980s and 1990s—but the volatility of their programs has been less marked. * The fragility of the American welfare state was dramatically illustrated in the wake of the 1994 congressional elections, when the new Republican majority, under the leadership of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, proposed to end AFDC as an entitlement program, to terminate numerous federal programs, and to markedly reduce federal tax revenues. It was illustrated, too, during the administration of George W. Bush when he attempted to privatize Social Security and Medicare—and to convert Medicaid into a block-grant program. If European conservatives chafe at the size of their welfare states and often propose cuts in specific programs, they lack the assertiveness and power of their American counterparts, whose rhetoric, writings, and actions often attack the welfare state itself. 4. Many American consumers pay relatively large shares of their personal income for social, medical, and educational services—a trend that in creased sharply in the 1980s and 1990s—and local and federal governments have increased fees and payment shares for many public programs. Elderly persons, for example, pay a large share of medical costs under Medicare in the form of various fees associated with the program, and many must deplete their savings altogether when they develop chronic or catastrophic health problems and move onto Medicaid. Mothers continue to fund a large share of day care costs because of inadequate public funding or stringent eligibility conditions. We are not suggesting that consumers ought not to shoulder some share of the cost of the services they use, but Americans place a sizable burden on many low-income, moderate-income, and middle-income residents. In a sense, Americans are gamblers against fate. Paying relatively low taxes when compared with Europeans, Americans must resort to personal savings, accumulation of assets, and fringe benefits (such as corporate pension funds) to self-fund major personal expenses. The many Americans who cannot save sufficient sums and who experience personal adversity—for example, a major health problem—must use means-tested programs such as SSI or Medicaid, but only after they have divested themselves of personal resources sufficiently to qualify. By contrast, Americans who can save money, who do qualify for liberal private pensions, and who are not beset by major social problems win the personal gamble. Indeed, low U.S. taxes on affluent Americans allow them to accumulate enormous personal resources and to increase American economic inequity as compared to other industrialized nations. 5. In comparison with European nations, the United States has subjected single heads of household (usually women) and their families to extraordinarily harsh policies. It was not until the mid-1930s that a federal program was created to help them, and even this modest program had become engulfed in controversy by the early 1960s. In succeeding decades, it has been constantly attacked by conservatives; its modest benefits have been markedly eroded, and stringent restrictions on its beneficiaries have been proposed. The enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Act of 1996 not only removed the welfare entitlement that had been embedded in the AFDC program but established even more stringent policies to force millions of women and children off welfare rolls without providing them guarantees of health care, child care, transportation assistance, and housing assistance if their wages were insufficient to bring them above official poverty levels. (Nor did this legislation give them sufficient training, education, and social service assistance to improve their long-term earning potential, thus consigning relatively unskilled and poorly educated women to low-paying jobs.) As a corollary to this point, children in the United States are treated more harshly than are children in many European nations, partly because most of them provide children’s allowances and child care—not to mention better health coverage and housing subsidies. It is no wonder that the term * feminization of poverty exists in the United States. * No single reason exists for the deprivation of marginalized populations in the United States. One factor is the gaps and meager benefits of the American welfare state, as illustrated by the absence of a national health care system, inadequate child care, and lack of a children’s allowance. The American tax system does not redistribute income from the upper quintiles to the lower quintiles; Americans of all social classes pay roughly equal tax rates when all sources, including sales and property taxes as well as Social Security payroll taxes, are included—and when we include tax loopholes and tax deductions used primarily by relatively affluent Americans. We must look, as well, to historical factors, such as the prolonged exclusion of many African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans from the industrial order and their subsequent attempts to play economic catch-up, with little assistance from white management and unions. Prejudice and racism, present in all nations, has assumed a larger role in the United States than in Europe, partly because of the U.S. larger populations of color, who have experienced rampant discrimination. With weaker trade unions than European societies possess, the wages of many low-and moderate-income American workers lag behind those of working-class Europeans. Persons of color also lag behind the white population because they were unable to obtain mortgages from banks to increase their wealth by purchasing houses. Nor can we ignore the effects of poverty and inequality upon vulnerable populations themselves. Social scientists such as William Julius Wilson have argued compellingly that people who live under onerous conditions, such as inner-city populations, sometimes develop destructive behaviors that contribute to their plight, including gang membership, violence, and substance abuse, even if these behaviors may be attributed in part to the harsh social and economic environments in which they live. * Even this cursory discussion suggests that a concentration of social problems in specific vulnerable populations in the United States is linked to interlocking circumstances that do not affect their counterparts as strongly in Europe, save for many low-income immigrants who are often marginalized in nations such as Great Britain and France. See Insert 14.2 for comparisons of the United States, Canada, and Sweden with respect to a variety of social problems and social policies in the three nations. It shows that America have higher poverty rates and child poverty rates, more low-paid jobs, higher infant mortality, live shorter lives, lower adult literacy, lower grade 12 math scores, higher homicides, higher rates of imprisonment, and higher rates of assault/threats than the other nations. These lower outcomes may be linked to lower levels of public expenditure in the United States than Canada and Sweden. The political pressure on government to increase social spending is decreased by far lower voting rates, as well as far weaker and smaller trade unions in the United States. Insert 14.2. Critical Analysis: Does the United States Lag behind Canada and Sweden? In 2002, Andrew Jackson, the director of research for the Canadian Council on Social Development, contended that the United States lags behind Canada and Sweden on “social performance.” * More than a decade later, not much has changed, according to a 2013 report from the Social Progress Imperative, a working group of the World Economic Forum that is headed by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter. The group ranked the United States sixth—behind Germany, Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and top dog Sweden, in its Social Progress Index, which sets to compute “the extent to which countries provide for the social and environmental needs of their citizens.” Later in this chapter we discuss some factors that help us better understand why the United States possesses a reluctant welfare state. Read Jackson’s 2002 report below and compare it to the updated findings from the Social Progress Imperative, which you can access at http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/data/spi . Select two or three of Jackson’s indicators and determine whether they still hold true today. Canada Beats USA—But Loses Gold to Sweden By Andrew Jackson, Director of Research, Canadian Council on Social Development, March 8, 2002 As we’ve all heard ad nauseam , Canada lags behind the USA in terms of productivity. But how are we doing when it comes to our social performance? In the afterglow of our gold-medal victories over our neighbours to the south, it seems timely to present a scorecard. Twenty-Five Key Indicators of Social Development Details The bottom line? Canada beats the United States hands down on most social indicators, but we still fall well short of the Swedes. So there’s reason for pride, but not for complacency. Our 25-indicator scorecard looks at income and poverty; jobs; employment security; social supports for families; health; crime; education; and civic participation. In terms of average income, it’s no surprise that we lag behind the United States. Adjusted for purchasing power, the average Canadian family has 21% less income than the average American. But our income is much more equally distributed. Using a common definition of poverty (having less than half the income of the average family), one in 10 Canadians are poor compared with one in six Americans and just one in 16 Swedes. One in six Canadian kids is poor, compared with almost one in four American children. When it comes to jobs, the United States wins in terms of low unemployment, but there is little difference between the three countries in the proportion of people who have jobs. The United States does worse than Canada, however, when it comes to the quality of jobs, and here we both compare badly to the Swedes. Final Medal Standings U.S. Sweden Canada GOLD 2 20 4 SILVER 3 2 19 BRONZE 20 2 2 A common definition for being “low paid” is being paid one-third less than the national average. If we use this definition to compare the workforces of the three countries, 21% of Canadian workers are low paid compared with 25% in the United States and just 5% in Sweden. More Americans than Canadians and Swedes work in jobs with very long hours. And Americans are much less likely to be in a union, to have access to unemployment insurance, and to qualify for government-paid retraining programs. One of the biggest differences is in terms of social supports, where Canada again stands between the United States and Sweden. American families have to pay much more out of their own pockets for health care and education, which wipes out a lot of the benefits of those vaunted lower taxes. Governments pick up 70% of the cost of health care and 60% of the cost of higher education in Canada, compared with 45% and 51% in the United States Overall, American families spend 9% of GDP on social protection— everything from health care to pensions—out of their own pockets, compared with only 4% in Canada and 3% in Sweden. Greater income equality and more citizenship entitlement programs make Canada and Sweden clear winners over the United States when it comes to health outcomes, crime rates, and educational attainment. And we get to enjoy it longer—Canadians live more than 2 years longer than Americans: 75 years compared with 72 years for men, and 81 years compared with 79 years for women. We in Canada are much, much less likely to be victims of violent crime than Americans. The murder rate in the United States is a staggering three times higher. And, for every 100,000 people, the United States has 546 prisoners, compared with 118 in Canada and just 71 in Sweden. Based on the results of the International Adult Literacy Survey, 50% of Americans have low literacy skills, compared with 43% of Canadians and just 25% of Swedes. At the other end of the skills scale, 39% of Canadian adults have completed postsecondary education, compared with 35% of Americans and 28% of Swedes. Finally, Canadians are more likely to be politically involved than Americans, though both of us compare badly to the Swedes: 56% of Canadians vote in parliamentary elections, compared with 49% of Americans and 83% of Swedes. Beating the United States for the silver medal is something to be proud of, but we should be aiming to wrestle that gold away from the Swedes. Perhaps it’s time to put some of our national pride to work to better our social performance. Notes and Sources Unless otherwise indicated, data are from the OECD Social Indicators Database.

Unlike other industrialized nations, the United States delivers an extraordinary amount of its social welfare benefits through the tax code rather than through programs funded directly from government budgets. These benefits are delivered through “tax expenditures,” which are exemptions, deductions, and credits in the tax code, as well as deferred taxes that allow citizens to pay less than their normal tax. Exemptions allow citizens not to pay taxes on some of their income. Deductions allow citizens to reduce their taxable income by Earnings replacement rate: average by family type and unemployment duration. 9.

Corporations deduct from their taxable income such expenses as the cost of their employees’ health insurance premiums and corporate pensions. Tax credits , which give citizens or corporations tax rebates, include the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and tax credits for certain corporate job training programs. Deferred taxes allow citizens to postpone taxes on income that is placed in private pension funds. The fiscal magnitude of specific tax expenditures is determined by calculating the extent to which they reduce tax revenues. The United States is unique in the extent to which it uses the tax code to fund social welfare. Tax expenditures currently account for one-third of all social welfare expenditures in the United States, as compared with less than one-tenth in other industrialized nations. When tax expenditures are added to budget expenditures, aggregate U.S. social welfare spending falls in the mid-range of these nations depicted in Figure 14.1 (when the cost of tax expenditures is added to direct funding of social welfare programs). * Some tax expenditures help low-income people, such as the EITC, which has become the largest antipoverty program for nonelderly persons in the United States. Many others, however, disproportionately help middle-and upper- income Americans. For example, low-income renters do not benefit from deductions from mortgage interest payments that deliver huge benefits to homeowners. Many low-wage workers, whose employers often do not provide health insurance or pensions, do not benefit from tax code provisions that allow corporations to deduct their contributions to employees’ health and pension plans. Moreover, low-income persons often do not benefit from tax policies that let relatively affluent persons defer taxes on their annual payments into their individual retirement accounts (IRAs)—or that provide tax exemption of payments to retirees from Roth retirement accounts. Even when citizens of different social classes take deductions, they receive strikingly different benefits according to their income levels. A person with a top marginal tax rate of 39% gains $3,900 from a $10,000 deduction, as compared with only $1,500 for a person with a top marginal rate of 15%. The sheer size of tax expenditures, which flow disproportionately to affluent persons, is revealed by comparing them with expenditures from the federal budget for social programs. From 1975 through 2004, for example, they cost only slightly less in aggregate than the nation’s combined expenditures for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid from 1965 through 2004. * As discussed in Chapter 13 , many conservatives hoped to increase tax expenditures that would help affluent people more than low-and moderate- income people. They have put forth proposals that would replace Medicare with medical savings accounts and Social Security with individual retirement accounts that would give citizens who used them substantial tax deductions, exemptions, or deferrals for income placed in them. They have retained tax loopholes that help affluent people, while ending ones that help low- and moderate-income persons in tax legislation during the presidency of Donald Trump, including not allowing taxpayers to deduct state income taxes that fund states’ social and educational programs. 7. Variations in social programs across geographic areas exist in all nations, but they are particularly prominent in the United States. Because the American federal government cedes many policies to states and localities, they shape their own welfare, health, and other policies. (Devolution in the 1980s and 1990s accentuated such localism.) States and localities vary greatly in their economic resources as well as in their political propensity to fund social programs. With regard to welfare programs like TANF, for example, some states fund particularly low grants and implement particularly severe time limits, whereas other states are more generous. Similarly, school districts in affluent suburban areas are often better funded than ones in inner cities beacause suburban school districts have higher tax revenues than inner city ones. Medicaid benefits vary greatly between different states. Box 14.1. Some Characteristics of the American Response to Social Needs 1. Low spending on social programs as a percentage of the GDP throughout the 20th century 2. Emphasis on means-tested programs rather than universal programs 3. Policy volatility: rapid changes in social policies within and between different eras 4. Significant out-of-pocket costs by consumers and citizens for an array of social needs 5.

Heavy reliance on tax expenditures to address social welfare needs 8. Regional variations that expose some residents to particularly harsh policies Examine Other Moral Flaws of the American Welfare State EP 2a We have discussed the reluctance of the American welfare state in relatively broad terms. We can also assess its moral rectitude by asking whether it addresses key important social problems that afflict vulnerable populations as well as the entire society. We list eight problems as illustrative examples of ethical flaws in the contemporary American welfare state—and refer you to websites that examine them in more detail. LO 14-2 Poverty From 2010 to 2011, 700,000 more persons experienced poverty, totaling nearly 50 million Americans living in poverty. This includes almost 20% of American children. See “2011’s Decline in Uninsured is Largest in 13 Years,” Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, September 17, 2012, at http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3836 . The poverty rate in 2015 according to the U.S. Census Bureau was 13.5% with 43.1 million persons living in poverty. Homelessness About 175,000 persons are unsheltered, sleeping outside or in places not meant for human habitation. See “Unsheltered Homelessness: Trends, Causes, and Strategies” in 2017, at http://www.endhomelessness.org/ . Persons Lacking Medical Insurance The number of Americans under the age of 65 when interviewed in 2017 was 28.2 million persons including 10.4% of children under age 18. See https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/healthj-insurance.htm . Youth Who “Graduate” from Foster Care About 20,000 of the nation’s 500,000 foster children “graduate” from foster care each year at age 18—only to encounter a difficult transition into life in the community. About 30% of America’s homeless people were once in foster care. Assistance to Persons Who Are in Jail or Who Have Returned to the Community Over 67% of the roughly 272,000 people released from state and federal prisons in 15 states were rear-rested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within 3 years. The vast majority of them receive no reentry help before they leave prison. See “Recidivism,” the Bureau of Justice Statistics, at http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=17 . Low W ages About one in five people (or 41 million) fall into a “hardship gap” where their earnings when combined with work benefits (such as health insurance and child care), together with assistance from programs such as SNAP and the Earned Income Tax Credit, do not meet their basic needs. See “Bridging the Gaps: A Picture of How Work Supports Work in Ten States,” Center for Economic and Policy Research and Center for Social Policy, October 10, 2007, at http://www.bridgingthegaps.org/publications/nationalreport.pdf . Feminization of Poverty One in eight women lived in poverty in 2016. Families headed by single mothers were 5.4 times more likely than married couple families to live in poverty—and ix in ten poor children lived in female-headed families. The poverty rate for all women 18 years and older was 14.6% in 2011; for women in households with no spouse present, four in 10 lived in poverty in 2011. Many of these female heads of household hold two or more jobs and still cannot reach, or barely reach, poverty levels. See “Women’s Poverty Rate Stabilizes, But Remains Historically High,” National Women’s Law Center , September 12, 2012, at http://www.nwlc.org/press- release/women’s-poverty-rate-stabilizes-remains-historically-high . Legal Status of Immigrants More than 55 million immigrants have settled in the United States since its founding, yet every wave of immigrants has encountered hostility. The roughly 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States are no exception. American corporations, food growers and processors, contractors, restaurants, and hotels depend on their labor, yet Americans grant them few rights. Congress has repeatedly failed to enact legislation to clarify their rights, most recently in 2007. Contextual Causes of Reluctance A range of theorists have implicated various cultural, political, and institutional causes of the reluctance of the American welfare state. Many of them identify a single primary cause. For example, Skocpol emphasizes political factors that shape policy choices—ideas of policy elites, organizational features of the U.S. state structure, and interest group pressures; Hartz emphasizes cultural variables; Shalev emphasizes the power of working-class organizations, such as trade unions; Edsall emphasizes the manipulation of race by political elites; and Berkowitz and McQuaid emphasize the role of corporate capitalists. * It would be simpler, of course, if the reluctance of the American welfare state could be explained by a single cause. Preceding chapters in this text suggest, however, that many factors, singly and together, have contributed to the reluctance of the American welfare state. Were we to push for a single explanation, we would not only risk ignoring the effects of other causes, but we would also fail to examine how the interactions of various factors shape the American welfare state. Our discussion of the evolution of the American welfare state confirms the importance, singly and in tandem, of the constraining contextual forces that we discussed in Chapter 2 . These include cultural, economic, institutional, and social factors; the chronological sequence of events; and legal and political factors, as discussed next. Analyze Cultural Factors EP 3a Americans have developed a multi-faceted mythology to justify their failure to develop a relatively generous welfare state. It includes a set of interrelated beliefs: that social programs do more harm than good, that social problems can be easily solved, that problems can be avoided by creating equal opportunity, and that laissez-faire policies can suffice to solve social problems. We call these interrelated beliefs a mythology because their validity remains unproven. LO 14-3 Problems and Panaceas Americans’ optimistic faith in simple solutions has impeded deeper analysis of the causes and persistence of social problems throughout the nation’s history. Poverty is linked to structural causes, such as recessions, low wages in certain sectors of the economy, disabling mental and physical conditions, low levels of skills and education, and discrimination. Simple solutions did not eliminate or mitigate poverty in the 19th century, when bread lines formed during recessions or when immigrants found themselves at the mercy of employers who paid low wages. The government regulations of the Progressive Era did little to help destitute immigrant workers in the nation’s cities. The Social Security program did not eradicate poverty among elderly persons, even though many of its framers were convinced that it would. Successive welfare reforms of the 1960s did not reduce the welfare rolls. The War on Poverty had minimal impact on the incidence of poverty in the United States. The Reagan administration’s cuts in social spending and punitive welfare policies did not substantially reduce the size of welfare rolls. Naive optimism that single programs can solve major social problems has fostered cynicism about the effectiveness of existing social programs. Time and time again, Americans have launched social programs with extravagant fanfare. When the programs failed to eliminate the problems, critics demanded their discontinuation, only to begin another cycle of hope and disillusionment. Americans have seldom realized that simple solutions rarely suffice to remedy complex problems or that the success of single programs is even less likely when they are poorly funded or implemented. The mental institutions of the mid-19th century became custodial institutions because they were poorly funded in subsequent decades. Regulations involving housing and public health were often rendered ineffective in the Progressive Era because they were not monitored. The War on Poverty never received more than $2 billion in any given year. The welfare reforms of the late 1990s were not accompanied with extensive funds for training and education. Networks of mutually reinforcing programs are needed to address social problems. The problem of the feminization of poverty in the contemporary period could be reduced, for example, by a cluster of programs—a children’s allowance, tax rebates and exemptions, enforcement of support payments from absentee fathers, and tax incentives to encourage employers to hire women who are single heads of household—but none of these remedies, by itself, would make a significant impact on the problem. It is also difficult for social programs to succeed in the absence of fundamental reforms designed to improve the economic and social status of disadvantaged persons. Individuals can benefit from services, job training, and improved education; but these positive benefits can be negated if people remain in blighted neighborhoods, suffer unemployment, or experience grinding poverty. The Misleading Analogy of the Fair Footrace Jefferson hoped that Americans could avoid the perils of a class-structured society if all residents were granted access to the land and to education. A combination of circumstances—the abundance of frontier lands, the remarkable speed of industrialization, the prosperity of many Americans, economic growth, and success stories of immigrants who achieved wealth —encouraged the perpetuation of Jefferson’s dream and the corollary notion that an expansive welfare state was not needed in a society that had created ample opportunities for its citizens to become wealthy. As our discussion in preceding chapters has indicated, many residents had an unfair advantage. For example, contrast the descendants of an Irish immigrant family that came to this country in the 1850s and the descendants of African American slaves. The Irish immigrant family lived in appalling conditions in Philadelphia and encountered considerable prejudice, but many members of the first two generations worked in industrial plants and attended public school. By the third generation (roughly 1940), various descendants had purchased homes, obtained jobs from Irish ward bosses, and completed high school. In the fourth generation, many family members no longer lived in Irish communities but in the suburbs, and a number of them attended colleges and entered professions. The African American family, once emancipated from slavery, lived in grinding poverty in the rural South of the postbellum years. Public education was not available to its members, who lived in shanty homes near the fields they tended as sharecroppers and field hands. For three generations, family members eked out a subsistence existence. Although some members sporadically attended segregated schools, successive generations perceived little utility in education because rural African Americans could not enter occupations where literacy was needed. Family members learned to live in their segregated conditions and saw little hope of improving their economic status. When a family migrated north to Chicago in the 1950s, it lived in a vast segregated African American community, in a city that was dominated by white politicians, white trade unions, and businesses owned by white entrepreneurs. Unlike the descendants of the Irish immigrants, who by 1960 had wealth, education, and desirable positions in the economic order in the North, most members of the African American family were illiterate and unskilled and faced the task of catching up in a society dominated by whites. They were subject to racial discrimination; they lacked the support of political machines; they found it hard to get industrial jobs; and the resources of African American churches in Northern cities had been overwhelmed by the enormous number of new arrivals from the South. Urban African Americans did not fare well in Northern schools, which were generally overcrowded and staffed by white teachers. Beliefs about Markets and Government American beliefs about markets and government have retarded the development of the welfare state. Many Americans have idealized private markets by suggesting that they worked best when left to themselves; this belief is perhaps best illustrated by economic theories in the Gilded Age, but it has flourished more recently with the advocacy of conservative economists such as Milton Friedman. These theories—which were accepted in the United States more widely than in Europe—promoted opposition to factory regulations, taxes, redistribution of resources from affluent to less affluent persons, public works, and national economic planning. The welfare state itself has been viewed as interfering with private markets because it diverts economic resources to nonmarket endeavors, such as income maintenance programs. * Ample evidence exists, however, that unregulated markets are not necessarily in the best public interest. Entrepreneurs have often victimized workers, consumers, and investors. Although many economic theorists have believed that implementation of their theories would end recessions, no one has yet succeeded. People of color and women have disproportionately borne the burden of economic suffering. Unregulated private markets do not bring an equitable distribution of wealth. If the problems created by capitalism are to be addressed, government regulations, social programs, taxes on affluent persons, and economic planning are needed. Beliefs about Equality Prejudice against poor persons, which has fostered punitive strategies and benign neglect, has been supplemented by theories that extol the merits of economic inequality. Many European aristocrats and American leaders in the 18th century contended that the leadership of social elites would prevent the rise of demagogues, who, they feared, could capitalize on the ignorance, emotions, and licentiousness of the common people. When Benjamin Franklin wrote that “what the rich expend, the laboring poor receive in payment for their labour,” he was arguing that affluence of an upper class is needed to support and sustain poor persons. * Many American politicians in the 20th century, including Calvin Coolidge and Ronald Reagan, argued that the nation had to increase economic inequality so that an affluent class would have the resources to make investments that would ultimately benefit poor persons. These prejudices and economic theories, which have deterred the development of generous social programs and other policies to decrease economic inequality, have been less influential in Europe because they have been more effectively challenged by leaders of working-class organizations and political parties. European socialists and radicals countered that affluent persons were themselves social parasites who used their resources to victimize the working class and to maintain extravagant lifestyles. American liberals, spared the need to articulate more progressive positions by the absence of a powerful radical movement, have often advocated policies surprisingly similar to those of conservatives. Thus, Franklin Roosevelt supported relatively meager unemployment benefits and regressive Social Security taxes; Kennedy and Johnson enacted tax cuts that markedly increased economic inequality; and many liberals have supported massive increases in military spending at the expense of social programs. Americans have tended to emphasize equality of opportunity rather than equality of status or wealth. It is important, of course, to have equality in education so that citizens of different social classes and races have access to similar educational opportunities. But status and wealth are also important because they reflect the degree of equality between members of different social classes. Partly because European nations have had powerful socialist or labor parties, they are more likely to consider equality of status and wealth—a propensity that leads them, in turn, to want to use the powers of government to redistribute resources from affluent to less affluent persons. Discuss Economic Factors Low Levels of T axation Low levels of taxation contribute to the reluctant welfare state by depriving social programs of funding. Already meager by comparison with those of many European nations, federal tax revenues have been depleted from 1950 onward by large military expenditures. An overview of the evolution of American taxes suggests that U.S. history has been an extended Boston Tea Party; taxes have been perceived as alien even when imposed by the American government. Americans first developed a federal income tax during the Civil War but abruptly canceled it when the war was over. Although various reformers wanted an ongoing federal income tax, the Supreme Court declared an income tax law to be unconstitutional in 1894, setting the stage for enactment of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1913. However, the federal income tax did not assume significant proportions until World War II, when it was finally levied on most people. In subsequent decades up to the present, Americans collected far greater federal taxes than prior to World War II—but still far less per capita than European nations or Canada. (See Table 14.1 .) LO 14-4 Table 14.1. Total T ax Receipts as a Percentage of GDP in 28 Nations Denmark 51.6% Sweden 51.0 Finland 47.3 Czech Republic 47.3 Belgium 46.6 The Netherlands 45.9 Luxembourg 45.0 France 44.1 Poland 43.2 Austria 42.8 Greece 42.5 Italy 41.7 Norway 41.2 Hungary 41.0 Germany 39.3 The relatively low levels of American taxes have placed significant downward pressure on budget allocations for social programs.

Given their chronic reluctance to increase taxes, the budget could only be balanced by restraining expenditure. The reluctance to have large budget deficits changed with President Reagan, whose tax cuts and military spending created deficits during his tenure that exceeded those of all presidents that preceded him. President George W. Bush followed Reagan’s game plane by slashing taxes and increasing military spending. President Trump’s proposed tax and budget policies in late 2017, followed a similar script that, if enacted, would add $1.5 trillion to the national debt in five years. He proposed to increase military spending and cut taxes—and to cut social spending to cut deficit spending precisely as Presidents Reagan and G. W. Bush had done. Military Spending From 1950 onward, scarce federal revenues have been depleted by military spending. Though Britain and France have had significant armed forces, their military budgets, as a percentage of GNP, have been much smaller than U.S. defense spending. Throughout the Cold War, West Germany and Japan spent far smaller amounts than the United States. Since 1950, the U.S. military budget has absorbed roughly $300 billion per year in constant 1992 dollars, for a staggering total of some $12.6 trillion. President Reagan increased military spending at a rate that was unprecedented during peacetime. He hoped to add another trillion dollars to military spending with his Strategic Defense Initiative, but Congress balked when its costs became evident. Bill Clinton made some cuts in military spending, but they were undramatic. The American military budget was increased again by President George W. Bush, declined somewhat during Barack Obama’s tenure, but President Donald Trump proposed to increase it markedly. While the United States was expending these huge resources on defense, European nations and Japan were devoting their revenues instead to productive investments and social programs. (See Figure 14.2 .) It is true: the threat from terrorist organizations markedly increased from 2001 through 2016. The United States led the military attack against terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in many other African and Asian nations. Yet critics contend that the United States used outdated military tactics that had been used in the Cold War to excess, such as aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, and vast numbers of troops. So-called “soft power,” like community development and development of infrastructure, might have been greatly expanded. Figure 14.2. HECTOR MATA/AFP/Getty Images President George W. Bush declaring an end to combat in the Iraq War on an aircraft carrier off San Diego on May 1, 2003. Discuss Institutional Factors Jurisdictional Confusion The American welfare state has been characterized by jurisdictional confusion, particularly from the New Deal onward. Unlike most welfare states in Europe, where national social programs that were funded by central governments developed decades or centuries ago, the American welfare state evolved from the bottom upward—that is, from local governments (in the colonial period and the early 19th century) to state governments (from the mid-19th century to the New Deal) to the federal government (from the New Deal onward). These different levels of government each contribute resources, programs, and policies to the American welfare state. They are joined, moreover, by extensive involvement of the not-for-profit and for-profit sectors. If conservatives tend to favor extensive use of the private sector, free markets, local government, and state government, liberals generally want large federal entitlements to remain intact. At an operational level, the sharing of policy responsibilities by all of these sectors and levels of government not only brings confusion to social policy, but can lead to extensive buck-passing as each sector and level of government seeks to shift programmatic responsibility for vulnerable populations to the others. Complex negotiations about the appropriate roles of state and federal governments have stymied several social reforms, including welfare reforms, national health insurance, and national child care policies. LO 14-5 Explore Social Factors Racism and Prejudice European societies are more homogeneous than the United States because, until recently, they have not experienced waves of immigration. They possess far fewer persons of color as a proportion of their populations than the United States with its combined populations of African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. Attitudes to ethnic and racial vulnerable populations have certainly contributed to the relatively slow growth of the American welfare state. Because of the persistence of racism and prejudice, many Americans have been inclined to believe that unemployment, crime, and other social ills were concentrated within ethnic and racial populations rather than distributed throughout the population. Consequently, they have felt little need to develop comprehensive welfare institutions. At various times, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, Russian Jews, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos have each served as the scapegoat for the nation’s social ills. Considerable prejudice has slowed policy reforms, moreover, for each of the 18 vulnerable populations that we identified in Chapter 2 and then discussed in the context of specific historical eras. Sexism hindered the development of family planning, day care, and affirmative action programs; prejudice against mental patients slowed the growth of expenditures for a range of community services, such as halfway houses; homophobia delayed a social response to discrimination against gay men and lesbians and to the AIDS epidemic; and ageism delayed the development of humanitarian community-based alternatives to nursing homes, as well as the funding of policies for chronic medical conditions. LO 14-6 White Americans’ resentments against the beneficiaries of social programs have few parallels in European nations. While some middle-and upper-class Europeans have criticized people who use social programs, until recently these criticisms have lacked a racial dimension because most Europeans are white. Moreover, because European social programs are relatively universal, the welfare state is regarded as belonging to the entire nation rather than to specific subgroups. Citizens of European nations have also been more willing to tax themselves to fund their social programs. Understand the Sequence of Events The Late Development of the American W elfare State When discussing the history of the American welfare state, a central fact is apparent: It emerged relatively recently, during the New Deal era ( Figure 14.3 ). (As we argued in Chapter 5 , Civil War pensions did not breach the American tradition of not vesting the federal government with social policy functions.) In many European nations, by contrast, an array of generous national programs—such as health insurance, old age pensions, housing programs, and unemployment benefits—were already well established by the 1930s. Figure 14.3. Details Recency of the American welfare state. After World War II, moreover, most European governments presided over a vast expansion of social spending, such as the Beveridge plan in Great Britain, whereas in the United States, social spending actually fell below New Deal levels in the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. Most of the major programs of the U.S. welfare state were not enacted until the 1960s and 1970s. LO 14-7 This late development of the American welfare state contributed to its reluctance in several ways. Traditionally opposed to a significant social welfare role for the federal government, Americans would not support a generous welfare state until they learned that social programs could benefit a wide range of people. As we see, this learning process began relatively late in the nation’s history. The late development of the American welfare state also helps explain the intensity of conservative opposition to it. From the conservatives’ perspective, the welfare state is an intruder on a society that emphasized localism and state policies, as well as private philanthropy. By contrast, European conservatives, accustomed to monarchies, centralized government, and centralized social policies, viewed their emerging welfare states in the 20th century as a continuation of government activities that had long been present. The Military State Precedes the W elfare State We have already discussed how military spending diverted funds from social spending from 1950 onward, but the timing of the military state’s inception is also important. When the American welfare state finally emerged in its contemporary form in the 1950s, it had to compete with a military state already established by the large Cold War increases in military spending of the 1950s. The military state already absorbed nearly three- fourths of the federal budget in the 1960s, so it had first claim on the bulk of federal resources. While conservatives depicted the Great Society as an era of runaway social spending, funding for social programs was relatively limited, partly because of prior budgetary commitments to military programs and the Vietnam War. Even after the Great Society programs were established, military and social programs competed for the limited discretionary component of the federal budget—that is, the annual appropriations of Congress. In eras of financial stringency, this component is vulnerable to cutbacks, unlike the entitlements, whose benefits are automatically funded each year. In this way, military spending continued to place strong downward pressure on a range of social programs into the present. Imagine if the welfare state had preceded the military state, and military programs had to fight for funds that had already been largely committed to social programs! Legal Factors As we have noted in previous chapters, the Constitution slowed the growth of social programs in the United States by not explicitly defining social policy roles for the federal government. Coupled with a political philosophy that extolled local and state governments while criticizing the federal government, this constitutional silence enabled generations of politicians to stifle a federal welfare state until the New Deal. Even after the New Deal, conservative politicians tended to regard the federal welfare state as an intruder with no legal standing, and they attempted to return policy roles to local and state governments. We have discussed, as well, the conflict between relatively liberal and conservative judges in the nation’s various courts, including most prominently the U.S. Supreme Court. Even when Congress enacts laws to protect the rights of members of specific vulnerable populations, for example, these statutes are subject to judicial interpretation and even judicial overruling—even though the right of the federal government to develop, fund, and implement social programs was finally established by the mid-1930s. Political Factors Whatever the contribution of contextual forces, the reluctance of the American welfare state has also depended on political processes, as expressed in the policy decisions of local, state, and federal legislators. Absence of a Powerful Radical T radition The working class has the most to gain from the development of pension, welfare, work inspection, factory regulation, and other social programs because its members are most subject to economic uncertainty, poverty, and exploitation by employers. Welfare states are therefore likely to grow most rapidly in those nations where the working class is organized to demand the enactment of social programs and regulations and where radical ideology, such as socialism, promotes class struggle and the expansion of the welfare state. Indeed, radical ideology served two functions in European societies. First, it emphasized the need to develop programs and policies that would assist the working class. Second, it emphasized common or collective needs of the whole society—for example, public health measures and old age pensions. Both functions enhanced the expansion of the welfare state. Although many conservatives in Europe supported the expansion of the welfare state, the primary impetus generally came from leftist parties. Socialist and labor parties were remarkably effective in national elections in the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. These class-based parties had large constituencies, often held power, and possessed an ideology—in particular, socialism, which was supportive of large welfare states. Far larger numbers of persons are members of trade unions than in the United States as documented in Insert 14.2 . If roughly 89% and 36%, respectively, of Swedes and Canadians are unionized, less than 18% of Americans are unionized. Trade unions have their shortcomings, but they support social, tax, and budget policies that help working people. Their near absence in the United States deprives working people of an ally that can support social reforms and fight against tax and budget policies that accentuate economic inequality. At first glance, the U.S. Democratic Party would seem analogous to these European leftist parties: It represented a significant segment of less affluent people, held significant power in the decades after World War II, and subscribed to a relatively liberal ideology. This American party was different from its European counterparts in several ways, however. Not least, it included a major wing that was decidedly conservative—the Southern Democrats, whose threats to vote Republican often forced concessions from Democratic leaders in Congress. Moreover, Democratic ideology was not as leftist as that of many European parties, which openly endorsed socialist ideas. Although the political base of the European leftist parties was the trade union movement, which militantly favored the expansion of the welfare state, American unions, with important exceptions, focused on measures relating to their own legal and collective bargaining powers. American unions became progressively weaker, moreover, in the four decades following 1965 as their membership plummeted in the wake of attacks from “right-to-work laws” in many states that gave workers the right not to join unions even in companies that had them. The Democratic leaders also had to contend with Republican leaders, who were more strongly opposed to social reforms than were their counterparts in Europe for the cultural and political reasons we have discussed. However, Republican leaders liked to tar Democrats as tax-and-spend reformers, many European conservatives, used to centuries of large central governments, supported social reforms; for example, Benjamin Disraeli, the 19th-century English conservative, believed that the affluent classes bore a responsibility to advance the welfare of the nation and of the lower classes. Conservative politicians in Europe and Canada have mostly accepted higher taxes and relatively munificent social programs as compared to American conservatives. President Trump’s and Republicans’ attacks on social programs and taxes in 2017 is just another conservative assault on a welfare state that is relatively modest as compared to those in Europe and Canada. Nor did the Democratic leaders pursue policies that enabled the nation to munificently fund social programs. They often supported large tax cuts; for example, the huge tax cut of 1964 depleted government revenues just as Lyndon Johnson was initiating the Great Society. And they supported large military expenditures during the Cold War, often without even pondering their implications for the domestic budget. Americans have not lacked for social protest or radical movements. Utopian theorists favored the development of communal villages in the 19th century; legions of radical workers engaged in strikes and organizing in the 19th and 20th centuries; and radical organizations (such as the Industrial Workers of the World, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party) were active in the Progressive and New Deal eras. As compared with European societies, however, working-class protest and radical ideologies were weak. * In the absence of a strong working-class movement, advocacy organizations for vulnerable populations provided considerable impetus for reform. Encountering widespread discrimination, the various vulnerable populations often focused their political efforts toward gaining rights for their members. Civil rights activists in the 1950s and early 1960s sought to erase Jim Crow laws; Latinos sought collective bargaining powers for field workers; Asian Americans fought to eradicate laws that limited their rights to own land earlier in the century; and feminists sought to eradicate discrimination against themselves in education, employment, and medical settings. We do not mean to criticize the emphasis on civil rights, because each of the outgroups experienced profound prejudice and discriminatory policies; but this focus, however necessary, may have detracted from efforts to obtain national health insurance, child care, more munificent job training programs, and other social programs. The development of working-class power in the United States was complicated by the successive waves of immigration and by the internal migration to Northern cities from the South in the 1950s and 1960s. Immigrant groups spoke different languages and established their own communities and political organizations. Conflict sometimes erupted as their members competed for jobs and local political offices. * African American migrants to the North and the West were often subject to discrimination by fellow workers who feared they would take their jobs and who were often racist. Another complicating factor is that many American workers did not identify strongly with their social class. In a nation that has strongly favored upward mobility, many Americans wanted to join the middle class, in contrast to European traditions of working-class solidarity. In the colonial period, indentured servants and immigrants aspired to purchase land or to start new businesses. In the 19th century, many working-class persons aspired to obtain gold, land, or wealth through hard work and luck. More recently, many blue-collar workers have aspired to (and gained) the trappings of suburban life, complete with two cars and home ownership. Seeking upward mobility, many American workers did not advocate for government programs to advance the interests of the working class because they hoped to escape the working class. In the absence of a powerful radical tradition in the United States, political compromises have been fashioned between moderate and conservative politicians without more radical groups questioning their compromises. When Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy wrote their tax and social legislation, they were unconcerned about the views of radicals; rather, they were afraid that a coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats would scuttle their domestic legislation. Had radicals also been part of the negotiating process, major legislation might have been more redistributive, made fewer concessions to the rights of states, and been broader in scope. In the absence of class-based politics, interest groups have assumed far more importance in the United States than in Europe. Unfortunately for citizens seeking relief from social problems, the most powerful interest groups tend to represent corporations and conservatives, whose needs have been disproportionately represented in the negotiating process. * Nonvoters Voting rates in the United States have long been lower than in European nations. Significantly, nonvoters are predominantly from low-income groups—the very persons whose interests would be served by social programs. This group is so large that it could aptly be called the party of nonvoters. Social scientists differ in their explanations of the size of this group: Some emphasize procedural barriers to registration and voting, which have been slightly eased by recent policy enactments; others believe that low-income Americans are even more cynical about American politics than are middle-class Americans. Believing the deck is stacked against them and that private interests, corporations, and affluent Americans dominate politics, many decide that their votes count for nothing. * Or they may be so preoccupied with surviving that they can’t relate to partisan politics. The Power of American Conservatives American conservatives have fought social reforms because such reforms required increases in taxation, enlarged the federal government, interfered with local prerogatives, equalized economic and social conditions, or ran counter to the economic interests of corporations. Conservative defense of the status quo had its golden era in the United States in the 19th century, but its proponents possessed extraordinary power even during the liberal reform periods of the Progressive, New Deal, and Great Society eras because they could meld the power of the Republican Party with that of conservative Southern Democrats. We have discussed the extraordinary power of conservatives during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, when they slashed spending on many domestic programs and obtained significant tax cuts that depleted resources for the domestic agenda. Conservatives gridlocked the presidencies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, thwarting the achievement of their policy goals. American conservatism provided a more devastating resistance to the development of social reforms than did European conservatism. European conservatives had helped construct the strong monarchies and central governments of European nations from the 16th through the 19th centuries because they wished to facilitate national economic planning; preserve their own prerogatives; place controls and regulations on industrialists and bankers, whom they sometimes regarded as rivals; or advance their paternalistic traditions in helping the downtrodden. Even when conservatives supported a central government to quell social uprisings, they enhanced its power and hence its ability to finance and administer social programs. By contrast, American conservatives obtained their ideology not from the traditions of the landed aristocracy but from theorists like John Locke. While European aristocrats often used government to perpetuate their paternal status, American conservatives wanted to obliterate government, except as it specifically helped corporations, facilitated economic growth, and served national defense. In Europe, there was often tension between the aristocracy and industrialists. American industrialists, however, had no serious competitors in local and national governments in the Gilded Age. Taxes, tariffs, and subsidies were devised to advance their interests. Their power was gradually diminished in the 20th century as unions, reformers, and people at the grassroots demanded various regulations, but corporate lobbying efforts and campaign contributions have made them powerful political forces. Corporations have not always opposed the expansion of the welfare state, but organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers have consistently fought proposals that would significantly increase government welfare expenditures or subvert their corporate interests. Moral Crusades Although the term crusades may seem melodramatic, it describes the fervor of many temperance, anti-drug, anti-obscenity, anti-gay, anticrime, and anti- abortion projects (see Figure 14.4 ). Throughout American history, determined reformers have expended enormous effort in trying to eradicate immoral behavior, whether by prohibiting it or by engaging in public education. These crusades have diverted attention from other kinds of social reforms and have often exacerbated discrimination against persons whose personal lifestyle choices were publicly condemned. * Figure 14.4. Brendan Hof fman/Getty Images “Right to lifers” seek to outlaw abortions in the 1980s. In the contemporary era, the efforts of the Christian Coalition and kindred groups have focused on lifestyle issues, such as restricting the rights of gay men and lesbians, limiting women’s access to abortions, allowing prayer in public schools, fighting programs to give sex education and condoms to youth, and opposing efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS through distribution of sterilized needles. Each of these projects, in turn, has required marginalized populations to develop protracted and difficult counter-campaigns. In European societies, where such moral clashes are less common, reformers can pay more attention to advancing their agenda. A Rigged System Powerful interest groups and well-heeled contributors have exercised extraordinary influence over American elected officials, to the detriment of social reform. Despite recent efforts to limit their influence, wealthy people and corporations continue to shape policies by taking advantage of numerous loopholes in campaign funding legislation. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission held that government cannot keep corporations or unions from spending money to support or defeat candiddates in elections—a ruling that reinforced massive spending on campaigns from special interests and rich people. Our discussion of the Gilded Age in Chapter 4 , a time when corporate interests often dominated American policy making, suggests that these contemporary phenomena have deep historical roots. Understand Reluctance as the Outcome of Numerous Factors EP 5c Even a cursory examination of social policy history suggests that no single factor suffices to explain the reluctance of the American welfare state. We have uniquely identified a wide array of factors and suggested that together they have promoted a relatively reluctant American welfare state (see Insert 14.3 ). Insert 14.3. Critical Analysis: A Comparison of Americans and Europeans Approaching Retirement As Americans enter their 50s, they must engage in a series of financial maneuvers if they want to secure sufficient resources to protect themselves from economic bankruptcy in their retirement years. They can expect to encounter health problems as they grow older, and a significant fraction of them will experience chronic—long-term— health conditions that require them to obtain costly medical services for a protracted period. A significant number will have to enter a nursing home or receive long-term services in their homes—for example, from visiting nurses. LO 14-8 Many factors make Americans nervous as they face retirement. Because of corporate downsizing, increasing numbers of employees in their 50s are losing their jobs, and some may find that they deplete their personal resources even before they reach their 60s. As companies increasingly curtail or eliminate pensions, aging Americans face further drains on their personal resources. Some know that Medicare covers treatment only for acute —short-term—medical conditions, and that they themselves will be required to pay for medical care that extends beyond specific surgeries or other brief treatments. Some are anxious that even the Social Security and Medicare entitlements will not survive the uncertainties of the American political process. Might conservatives succeed in eliminating or further curtailing them? If retirees want to purchase medical security by entering retirement villages or homes, such as Leisure Village in Southern California, they need to have sufficient assets to pay the roughly $500,000 entrance fee and the roughly $4,000 monthly fees. Contrast these aging Americans with their counterparts in Scandinavia, who know that they will enter their senior years with national health insurance that requires them to pay virtually nothing for short- or long- term care. Scandinavians know that government-funded retirement facilities charge minimal entrance fees and minimal monthly fees, even for relatively affluent people. Because their pensions are more munificent than American Social Security pensions, they have sufficient funds for recreation. What are some implications of these two situations? Is the American gamble worth it, psychologically and financially? Do American policies create a class of persons who enter their senior years with extraordinary life options and another class of people with very restricted options—as contrasted with a Scandinavian system where most people exceed a threshold of security? When it finally emerged, the American welfare state was structured so as to deter widespread support. The eligibility of many means-tested programs was established at such low levels in the United States that white, blue- collar workers, who provided strong support for the expansion of European welfare states, found social programs irrelevant to their needs; indeed, they were inclined to believe that such programs were primarily used by people of color. Fewer universal programs existed in the United States. Funding and policy responsibilities were so dispersed that it was difficult for reformers to know where to apply pressure. Moreover, support for social reform was scattered among a large number of vulnerable populations, whereas in Europe it was sustained by class-based, mass political parties such as the Labor, Socialist, and Communist parties. To illustrate how different factors interact, we can look at the Republicans’ surprising successes from the early 1970s through 2008 in attacking the scope of the American welfare state. We can begin with the relatively conservative stance of many American workers, who have rarely sought far- reaching social reforms, even if labor organizations were relatively liberal in the decades following the New Deal. In the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, a second anti-reform factor was white backlash, itself a euphemism for racism; large numbers of white ethnic voters defected from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party during this period. A third factor was the Republican tenet that doing good causes harm; accepting this premise, many ethnic voters came to believe that the generosity of American welfare programs had caused a precipitous rise in welfare rolls and the economic plight of African Americans. Finally, congressional action in the 1980s, 1990s, and during the presidency of George W. Bush was profoundly constrained by powerful moral crusades of the Christian right, which gave Republicans additional grassroots and campaign support. When discussing the recent attacks on the American welfare state, then, we need to link at least four factors: the absence of radical pressure from working-class Americans, racism, the belief that welfare programs do harm, and moral crusades. Identify Redeeming Moral Features of the American W elfare State EP 5a EP 8d Americans have lagged behind many industrialized nations in developing their welfare states, but we ought not to overstate the extent of the lag. Whereas European nations possessed various smaller programs, the major burst of social reform occurred in the immediate aftermath of World War II. That was when Great Britain, for example, enacted the Beveridge plan, including national health insurance, national social services, and other economic reforms. Canada followed suit, as did many other European nations. In short, despite pressure from relatively radical parties, many European nations were relatively insensitive to the needs of many of their constituents until relatively recently. And their reforms were not immune from rollbacks, such as Margaret Thatcher’s sweeping cuts in Britain’s social programs in the 1980s or cuts made in Canadian social programs in the 1990s. In discussing obstacles to social reforms in the United States, then, we should not imply that obstacles did not exist in other nations. Nor should we overstate the size of their welfare states prior to the end of World War II. LO 14-9 Asserting the Ethical Case for the American Welfare State Although many conservatives correctly argue that social problems persist despite the existence of the American welfare state, they fail to consider that many problems would be even worse if Americans had not developed social policies. Assume, for example, that Medicaid had not been enacted in the mid-1960s. Without Medicaid, the health care needs of low-income populations, already seriously under-served by public clinics, would have reached catastrophic proportions because local and state governments lacked the resources to address them. Older people who had exhausted their Medicare benefits would have been unable to rely on the Medicaid program; thus, hundreds of thousands of them would have been forced into nursing homes even worse than those they encountered in the 1970s and succeeding decades. Persons with AIDS, often financially devastated by the expense of medical procedures, would have received no services unless physicians and hospitals had donated them. Indeed, we can proceed through each of the major enactments of the 1960s and succeeding decades and render a similar prognosis. Assume, for example, that SSI and Food Stamps did not exist. Would not this erasure of social enactments have led to a homeless population many times its size from 1980 to the present? Without these programs, what would have happened to economic inequality in the United States, which is already far greater than in European nations, Canada, and Japan? As just one example of the positive effects of social policy, the Democrats were able to pass legislation to increase the federal minimum wage after they gained control of Congress in 2006. Some conservatives would retort, “But would not the reductions in government spending allow further tax reductions and thus increase the funds available for investment and consumption? And would not greater investment and consumption fuel higher rates of economic growth, which would ultimately help low-income populations find work?” The historical record provides little evidence that economic growth follows reductions in social spending. Affluent people use excess cash in many ways; they may make such nonproductive expenditures as luxury cars, second homes, and expensive vacations, or invest their funds abroad rather than in the United States. Moreover, expenditures on social programs themselves produce positive economic effects. Programs such as Medicare and Medicaid have funded hundreds of thousands of jobs and, by increasing the resources of their beneficiaries, vastly increased consumption not only by the beneficiaries themselves but also by relatives who might otherwise have had to fund the beneficiaries’ medical services. We ought not to concede, moreover, that all problems have become more severe in recent decades. Considerable progress has been made, for example, in addressing poverty among elderly persons; challenges to the civil rights of vulnerable populations; unemployment and lack of services for persons with disabilities; malnutrition; the health needs of certain groups in the population, such as persons with kidney failure; the preschool needs of low-income children; and psychological conditions such as depression. Many persons of color markedly improved their economic and social situation in the decades following the 1960s; this led to significant growth in the numbers of middle-class and upper-middle-class African Americans and Latinos, partly as a result of affirmative action and civil rights laws prohibiting job-related discrimination. Children in Head Start classes often show educational gains years after their enrollment. Nor should we ignore the short-term humanitarian function of social programs. Even when they do not solve social problems, they provide resources and support to people who are experiencing unemployment, catastrophic health conditions, or mental trauma, for example. In many cases, problems that were seldom recognized in prior eras have been publicized and addressed by new policies. Rape, child abuse, Alzheimer’s disease, spousal abuse, reading and learning disorders, discrimination against gay men and lesbians, and the needs of people with disabilities have existed throughout American history but have come to be widely recognized as important problems only recently. Victims of rape, for example, have often been subjected to punitive treatment, such as imputations of blame by judges and doctors. Children with developmental disabilities were routinely placed in institutions in the 1950s, in contrast to efforts to mainstream them in schools, communities, and employment in the 1990s. Children with reading difficulties were routinely discontinued from school in the 1950s, whereas they often receive special services in the 1990s. Persons with Alzheimer’s disease in the 1950s were rarely diagnosed and seldom received day treatment and other services. Government policies both emanated from heightened public awareness of these problems and contributed to the public’s knowledge of them, as individuals saw the benefits of social programs to themselves, their relatives, or their friends. Moreover, the existence of social programs has often raised public expectations about the rights and needs of specific groups in the population. Whereas Americans in 1950 commonly assumed, for example, that paraplegics would be bedridden and institutionalized, many Americans in the 1990s and beyond were aware of these individuals’ rights and capabilities, such as access to mechanized wheelchairs, independent living arrangements, occupational therapy, and employment. We can reasonably argue that the nation would have suffered harm in the absence of reforms enacted in the Progressive Era, the New Deal, and the Great Society, expansions of civil rights and entitlements in the 1970s, specific reforms of the 1980s and 1990s such as the child care and development block grant of 1990, and forthcoming benefits of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. We can hardly imagine what the United States would be like were it to return to social policies that prevailed at the beginning of the 20th century. American life has been profoundly changed by policy initiatives of various types. When the welfare state is defined broadly so as to include these many kinds of people-helping policies, its scope becomes clear; it assists every member of the population at many points during their lives. Affluent people take their welfare state for granted; they seldom recognize its effects on their lives or question the efficacy of those benefits that they receive. Unfortunately, the programs and tax benefits that persons of lesser means receive are often attacked and cut, as occurred during the Reagan years and in the wake of the Republicans’ 1994 election victories. Of course, people in the latter portion of the 19th century did survive without most of these kinds of policies. Unlike Marvin Olasky, who contends that the latter portion of the 19th century was an idyllic, nearly Utopian, period, most historians agree that people in this period were bedeviled by inequality, economic insecurity, epidemics, unsafe working conditions, food poisoning, unsafe housing conditions, rampant discrimination against persons of color and women, and many other social problems as we discussed in Chapter 4 . * Not Blaming the W elfare State for Things It Cannot Do Some critics of the American welfare state rely upon a false premise to conclude that the American welfare state—or some specific program within it—is ineffective. How can it be effective, they ask, if it fails to solve a specific social problem? In fact, many social problems defy “solution” because they are so complex. When viewed from the vantage point of history, many social problems display a remarkable persistence partly due to the difficulty of eradicating the factors that cause them: for example, social and economic inequalities (which foster alienation, desperation, and stress), lack of economic opportunities for unskilled people (which breeds unemployment, substance abuse, and crime), genetic factors (which promote certain diseases, particularly when coupled with poor diet and substance abuse), viruses (which bring new ailments such as AIDS, even as old ones persist), biology (which is responsible for degenerative diseases and new diseases like AIDS), corporate greed (which causes unsafe working conditions, pollution, and low wages), discrimination (which works to exclude specific populations from opportunities and jobs), family pathology (which underlies family violence and the problem of runaway youth), and individual pathology (which is associated with mental illness, suicide, and substance abuse). These various factors interact with one another, often in a complex fashion, to cause specific problems. Substance abuse, such as alcoholism, often stems from the combined interaction of biology, corporate advertising, family pathology, individual pathology, and lack of economic opportunities. Social programs can provide much-needed assistance and even promote certain changes in cultural attitudes, but, even if they are well conceived and well funded, they often cannot eradicate major social problems. Many social problems come from capitalism itself. Left to its own devices, capitalism does not necessarily provide economic equality or a living wage. As Kevin Phillips has superbly documented, economic inequality increased markedly during the 1980s in a trend that has continued in ensuing years. * Nor can social programs magically change the behaviors of individuals, families, and communities. Considerable research suggests that students’ achievement in schools hinges in considerable measure upon their families. Children who are not exposed to a varied and large vocabulary in their interactions with caregivers or parents are less likely to be successful in school than other children. Persons who smoke or use harmful drugs, who eat unhealthful foods, and who fail to exercise are less likely to be healthy than persons with better habits. Nor are social programs likely to solve some problems when they exist in an inegalitarian society with a huge impoverished population. Those who face bleak economic prospects in the first decades of the new millennium include single (mostly female) heads of household and their children, former factory workers forced into unemployment or low-wage service jobs, impoverished inner-city populations of persons of color, persons working at or near the minimum wage, isolated and impoverished rural populations, and older persons who lack pensions or who confront chronic medical conditions. We cannot say with precision how many people will develop additional social problems because of the desperation and alienation provoked by their bleak economic conditions. Despite the remarkable persistence and resilience of people in these groups, considerable evidence suggests that their economic status contributes to their problems. Unemployment greatly increases such problems as substance abuse, family violence, and mental illness. The vast majority of children in foster care come from low-income families, partly because economic desperation contributes to neglect as well as family violence. Dire economic circumstances partly explain why American prison cells are disproportionately inhabited by persons of color, who also experience high rates of substance abuse and deaths from homicide. We discussed in Chapter 12 how the plight of many vulnerable populations worsened in the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009 and beyond. Our discussion suggests that social policies cannot be expected to miraculously solve major social problems. When conservatives contend that the American welfare state has failed because it has not solved problems like poverty and homelessness, they are arguing from a false premise; in the real world, social policies do not eradicate social problems even though they can help many persons surmount them. To better understand some of its redeeming moral features, let’s summarize a partial list of social policies that are now part of the American welfare state thanks to the work of many policy advocates and that include many of the policies on the Policy Scoreboards listed at the end of Chapters 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 .

Critique Conservatives’ Case against the American W elfare State EP 4c Let’s analyze some likely effects of six policies often supported by conservatives: reducing social spending, delegating most policy functions to state and local governments, privatizing social services, relying more heavily on private philanthropy, instituting deterrent policies for welfare recipients, and rewarding personal responsibility. LO 14-10 Reducing Social Spending Some social programs do waste resources on unnecessary administrative staff—and some consumers make fraudulent use of programs’ benefits. But the preponderant share of programs’ costs go to benefits (in the case of benefit programs like Food Stamps) or to salaries (in the case of service programs like mental health and child welfare programs). While some adjustments and economies can be made, large spending cuts in social programs are usually achievable only by making deep cuts in benefits or in staff. Fraud rarely consumes a large share of social programs’ costs. Demands for cuts in program costs, then, often rest on an unrealistic assumption that huge savings can be achieved without sacrificing quality of services or the amounts of benefits. In the absence of major waste or fraud, this quest for huge savings often leads to poorer services and more meager benefits. Nor does indiscriminate cost cutting address the real problems in human services, such as turf boundaries. Take the case of child welfare programs. Many critics contend that, to help families that neglect or abuse their children, it is not enough to rely on occasional visits from a child welfare worker. Rather, child welfare staff need to engage schools, courts, child guidance agencies, case managers, substance abuse agencies, and job training agencies in a collaborative effort. Slashing the budgets of child welfare agencies hardly promotes such collaboration—and may even impede it by forcing overworked social workers to focus on crisis management. Cuts seem most feasible in medical programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, whose costs have escalated extremely rapidly; the United States expends greater resources on medical care than other nations do. However, cost cutters encounter formidable obstacles even when seeking to scale back the budgets of these programs. Their high costs stem partly from inefficiencies in the medical system as a whole—such as high fees charged by doctors and hospitals, the emphasis on curative rather than preventive services, and extraordinary use of costly medical procedures even in the last months of life. Large cuts in Medicaid and Medicare would not address these broader causes of the rise in medical spending and would often subject elderly and poor patients to less effective services. If their fees were dramatically cut, physicians and hospitals would increasingly refuse to serve Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, who would thus be forced into public hospitals and clinics, which are already underfunded by counties and municipalities. Overall spending for medical care in the United States must be reduced, but that calls for reform of the American medical system, rather than large cuts in publicly funded programs. Policy makers seeking to cut medical costs must remember that roughly 47 million Americans lacked health insurance or access to Medicare and Medicaid prior to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 when it gave insurance to more than 20 million persons over the succeeding years. Republicans and President Trump would have placed 23 milllion Americans off medical insurance had they succeeded in repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in summer 2017—and may yet accomplish this dubious goal during the remainder of Trump’s presidency. Cuts in specific programs sometimes cause increases in the costs of other programs. Thus, confronted with cuts in their Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements, providers raise fees for their other patients. Likewise, if we cut prenatal programs or programs that provide food to young children and their mothers, we may find that costs of medical programs increase correspondingly. Delegating Policy Responsibilities to State and Local Government Some policy functions can usefully be delegated to local and state governments, which already assume major responsibility for public education and the correctional system. They share responsibility for many social programs with federal authorities; under the block grant programs enacted by the Nixon and Reagan administrations, federal authorities provide money to states for programs and impose relatively few stipulations on their administration. In the 1990s, even in programs where federal authorities have traditionally exercised strong policy roles, such as Medicaid, the federal government increasingly issued waivers that granted permission to states to devise their own programs. Democrats, too, have sometimes supported conservatives’ quest to devolve policies to the states, as illustrated by President Bill Clinton’s support of TANF in 1996, which gave states even more responsibility for funding and administering welfare programs than had existed under the AFDC program. Conservatives often want to carry delegation of policy roles to far greater levels, as reflected by President George W. Bush’s desire to block-grant Medicaid. They sometimes imply that it will save vast sums of money or that it will strikingly improve the quality of programs. Whereas state and local governments can sometimes achieve economies by deleting federal regulations, they often discover that most program costs are absorbed by benefits and salaries. Delegation, in short, often brings scant savings unless state and local governments cut the size of programs inherited from the federal government. Indeed, facing budget difficulties of their own and lacking the large revenues of the federal income tax, state and local governments often do cut benefits or services when granted exclusive responsibility for funding social service programs. The dangers of delegation are particularly marked when federal authorities fail to impose minimum standards, such as requirements that states provide certain basic services in their Medicaid programs or give certain protections to TANF clients. We should remember that the federal government took on funding and oversight roles in the Great Depression and the Great Society because states and localities lacked the resources for social programs—and it had to give states hundreds of billions of dollars during the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009 and beyond as their tax revenues dropped. Unlike the federal government, states and localities often want to keep taxes at low levels to stop corporations from fleeing to locations with lower tax rates. Given their reluctance to increase taxes and the considerable costs of prisons and educational programs, states are unlikely to fund programs for relatively powerless populations such as single mothers unless federal requirements force them to do so. Privatizing Social Services Many conservatives want to place the administration of social services in the hands of for-profit corporations. Some for-profit corporations provide exemplary administration of social programs and even cut costs by management techniques drawn from private industry. Yet privatization carries dangers of its own. Unlike public and not-for-profit agencies, for- profit corporations divert funds as profits to owners and stockholders— profits that add costs to social programs. To maximize profits, corporations sometimes achieve efficiencies by cutting services to clients, hiring untrained staff, and providing no fringe benefits to staff. Alternatively, they may exclude people with serious problems from their services—whether by discriminating against them or by locating their services in relatively affluent areas. Of course, some not-for-profit agencies provide inferior services—and many for-profit agencies and corporations do provide quality services. Whenever the government contracts with nongovernment agencies, it needs to establish clear standards that are carefully monitored. Seeking Nongovernment Substitutes for Publicly Funded Programs Conservatives often suggest that private philanthropy, volunteers, and communities can serve as substitutes for government-funded social programs. These nongovernment entities already intertwine with government programs extensively—far more than in many European nations. Not-for-profit agencies usually receive more than half of their budgets from the government. Volunteers work for not-for-profit agencies, as well as some public ones. Private philanthropy augments public funding in many social agencies. Useful as supplements to publicly funded services, these nongovernment entities cannot easily become substitutes for them. Private philanthropy funds a network of not-for-profit agencies that provides valuable services to many Americans, but the extent of these services is a mere fraction of those provided by publicly subsidized programs. By the late 1980s, many not-for- profit agencies found themselves unable to sustain their budgets from existing donations and, moreover, faced cuts in their federal subsidies. In response, they turned toward fee-based programs and thus curtailed their services to impoverished clients, at the very time that the federal government was making cuts in programs serving the poor. * Furthermore, a large share of philanthropic dollars goes to the so-called respectable charities—including universities, hospitals, private schools, and cultural activities—rather than to agencies that serve stigmatized populations, such as persons who are homeless or mentally ill. Volunteers play a vital role in the human services system, but they cannot substitute for paid staff. Lacking training, many volunteers cannot help clients with complex problems. Some volunteers serve for relatively brief periods; they may burn out, as many agencies helping people with AIDS have discovered. Moreover, since the 1970s, the pool of available volunteers has shrunk as more women have entered the workforce. When public authorities rely on volunteers excessively, they risk exploiting them. Consider the lack of public services for older Americans with chronic problems. Many women, unable to find adequate home health care for their parents and relatives, take on the caregiving role themselves, even though they already have jobs and heavy parenting responsibilities. Viewed from a feminist perspective, politicians who refuse to provide public funding for home health care are extorting unpaid labor from these women. Skilled social workers often use informal networks to help specific clients or to enhance community support for a specific project, such as a halfway house. They cannot easily be substitutes for publicly funded services, however, because many individuals are not linked to informal networks, do not want community members to know about their problems, or are enmeshed in destructive networks. We have discussed, too, why it is not realistic to depend on faith-based organizations to provide a large share of services currently provided by public agencies and not-for-profit agencies that are registered as 501(c)(3) agencies with the federal Internal Revenue Service. Such agencies are often sponsored by religious organizations, such as the Catholic Church, but agree to offer services funded by government in separate facilities from the ones housed in their churches, agree not to display religious symbols, and agree not to proselytize their clients. Public grants to faith-based organizations not registered as 501(c)(3) organizations risk breaching constitutional separation of church and state if they seek to proselytize clients who come to them for services. Nor do many faith-based service organizations possess the facilities or staff sufficient to provide the volume of services needed by homeless persons and other at-risk populations. Our discussion ought not to suggest that volunteers, informal networks, faith-based organizations, and communities cannot assume important roles in the human services; however, it would be wrong to suppose that they could massively substitute for public programs. Using Deterrence Deterrent policies—whether 19th-century workhouses or conservatives’ efforts to place severe time limits on TANF benefits in 1996—sometimes diminish the expenses of social programs by frightening existing or potential users from seeking their benefits or by abbreviating their use. Penalties and investigations probably prevent fraudulent use of services by some people, much as audits by the Internal Revenue Service induce some people not to cheat on their taxes. Deterrence often does not cut the costs of programs markedly , however, because it does not address the basic causes of social problems. Take the case of “three strikes” legislation that was enacted in many states that imposed life imprisonment on persons with three convictions. This deterrent policy swelled prison populations so markedly that the legislation was amended in some states. In some cases, deterrent policies may even raise the costs of social programs, as Michael Kingsley recently argued. If the Internal Revenue Service simply distributed cash directly to people falling under poverty standards, public authorities would not need to fund the vast bureaucracy that currently investigates TANF clients. (Kingsley also pointed out that middle-class recipients of social benefits, such as tax deductions for mortgage payments, are not subjected to frequent investigations or caps on their benefits.) * Paradoxically, deterrence sometimes increases the incentive to cheat. Assume that you are a single mother with three children and that TANF benefits are cut in half. Also assume that you can find only work that pays the minimum wage. Unable even to survive on these benefits, your economic incentive not to report certain income or to hide assets would increase as benefits were cut. When seeking deterrent policies, conservatives risk overstating the extent to which people’s decisions are influenced by rational considerations. For example, there are many reasons why teenagers become pregnant. Some young women are raped. Some become pregnant in the hope of cementing a relationship with a boyfriend. Some become pregnant for lack of information about birth control. Others want a child to make their lives more fulfilling. In light of these complex motivations, many social scientists doubt that deterrent policies, such as refusing or severely limiting public benefits to teenage mothers, will reduce out-of-wedlock birth-rates— and they point to data from New Jersey, where these birthrates increased when deterrent policies were imposed. * Finally, deterrent policies sometimes violate ethical principles. If individuals have become dependent on public programs because well- paying work is not available to them, punitive policies punish them for circumstances that they cannot control. If public benefits are denied to unwed teenagers who have children, those children will often experience malnutrition and other harmful outcomes. Relying on Personal Responsibility Conservatives often argue that the American welfare state has created a culture of dependency, within which people are accustomed to public subsidies when they encounter misfortune or to light sentences when they commit crimes. They want Americans to develop instead a culture of personal responsibility, which prizes personal efforts to be self-sufficient and to help others who experience social problems. If people are not self- sufficient or develop certain problems, conservatives often contend, they should shoulder the consequences, such as poverty or incarceration. * No one would argue that citizens should not try to remain self-sufficient; but the ideology of personal responsibility often assumes that personal character is the primary reason people do, or do not, develop social problems. Even when they act responsibly, however, many people develop social problems. Many homeless people, for example, are unable to pay rent because they became unemployed when their employer downsized or because they work in low-wage jobs. People with high school educations occupy a precarious position in the service-oriented economy of the 1990s; although they can usually obtain work, they often receive wages that place them under poverty standards. Carried to an extreme, the ideology of personal responsibility blames victims of social circumstances for their plight, much as Americans in the 19th century assumed that poverty stemmed from defects of character. In some cases, public policies should reward responsible behaviors; for example, it is reasonable for nonsmokers to have lower health insurance premiums. People who commit destructive acts—for example, those who drive while drunk—should suffer penalties, such as prison sentences or suspension of their licenses. When carried too far, however, the idea of personal responsibility can unduly penalize people for conditions that they cannot readily control. People with substance abuse problems often have physiological and mental addictions that they cannot easily overcome even if they confront extraordinary penalties. If addiction is a disease, is it fair to penalize addicts excessively?Evaluate Contextual Factors that Have Promoted Enactment of Social Reforms EP 3a EP 3b Let’s discuss some of the factors that we identified in Chapter 2 as facilitating, rather than constraining, the enactment of social reforms in the United States. Indeed, many of the reforms enacted in the United States came into existence because of these enabling contextual factors. 1. Cultural factors include the way Americans perceived the importance and causes of specific social problems, the extent to which they believed that those in need were responsible for the problems, and the degree to which they thought that society had an obligation to assist those in need by providing ameliorative programs. We discussed how perceptions of various subgroups within the population, such as women and racial groups, have shaped social policies. Cultural factors that have created opportunities for policy advocates include: Sympathizing with persons who are perceived to be victims of circumstance—and therefore to be “deserving” of assistance from the welfare state—such as children and older persons. LO 14-11 Resenting persons and interests that unfairly victimize specific populations—therefore creating support for regulations and civil rights. Favoring provision of policies and programs that enhance opportunities for specific populations, such as preschool education and job training programs. Americans place extraordinary emphasis on providing opportunities to people. Thanks to extraordinary funding of junior colleges and 4-year colleges, about one-half of American youth seek schooling beyond high school, as compared with lower numbers of youth in some European nations. (Budget cuts in the past few decades have put increasing pressure on American colleges, however.) Some critics of expansive postsecondary education contend that many American youth would be better served by vocational education and job training that outfitted them for specific positions in the job market. Those critics underestimate, however, the considerable benefits of postsecondary education, which has expanded job opportunities for millions of American youth. In a world where unskilled positions are increasingly scarce, widespread participation in postsecondary education must be regarded as a remarkable American innovation. Other opportunity-enhancing policies include Head Start, job training programs, literacy projects, and some tax incentives and grants to small businesses—though we should remember that some European nations fund some of these policies more munificently than the United States. (France, for example, subsidizes universal preschool programs—as do Scandinavian nations.) Favoring programs and policies that reflect rights conferred by the Constitution and statutes such as due process, civil rights, the ability of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce, and the right of the federal government to advance the “general welfare. “ Believing that all people should have their minimal survival needs met so that persons do not starve, go entirely without medical care, or have no shelter. Developing a powerful liberal ideology that favored the enactment of an array of social programs, regulations, and civil rights, Particularly in the 20th and 21st centuries—thus becoming a driving force for many policy advocates and presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson. Creating a liberal coalition in the 1930s by President Franklin Roosevelt, often allied with the Democratic Party, that obtained enactment of a wide range of policies in succeeding decades up to the present—including persons of color, women, Jews, intellectuals, environmental groups, civil rights groups, and low- income persons. This coalition also included a large majority of white working-class and Catholic voters until the 1980s, when some of them switched their allegiance to Republican candidates. This coalition was refreshed by Lyndon Johnson when he made enactment of civil rights a national priority as the Civil Rights Movement placed pressure on him and the nation. 2. Economic factors include the extent to which the government possessed resources, such as tax revenues, to fund social programs; the extent to which corporations provided social benefits to employees; and the budgetary priorities of governments. Economic factors that provide opportunities for policy advocates include the following: The sheer size of national economic resources in the United States, creating a large reservoir of national income that can fund social programs. The existence of entitlements that are less susceptible to cuts because they are automatically funded each year to the level of claimed benefits rather than programs having to compete for funding with other programs in the general budget—such as Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, Supplementary Security Income (SSI), and unemployment insurance. The relatively high rate of economic growth in the United States in specific eras that created opportunities for many people. The American proclivity to use the tax code to help many low-and moderate-income persons obtain assets and gain income, such as tax deductions for interest payments on mortgages—and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for low-income families. The existence of a vast frontier in the colonial period and the 19th century that created opportunities for many people, including immigrants, to acquire land. The willingness of Americans to allow many immigrants to come to the United States. 3. Institutional factors include the extent to which governments possessed administrative capabilities to develop and implement social programs and the balance between federal, state, and local jurisdictions in social policy. Institutional factors that have provided opportunities to policy advocates include the following: The sheer number of entities that can contribute to policy solutions, including federal, state, and local governments, as well as the public and private sectors—providing policy advocates with many points of access. Nor should we ignore the salutary benefits of nongovernment organizations (NGOs). In nations such as Denmark, a tradition of not-for-profit organizations hardly exists. For most Danes, the publicly funded welfare state is the only source of assistance for their social needs. By contrast, Americans have emphasized the not-for-profit sector from the origins of the republic. An exponential increase in sectarian agencies in the 19th century and the early 20th century was followed by the development of nonsectarian agencies, including previously sectarian agencies that shed their religious origins. For example, many hospitals still possess the names given to them by their sectarian founders, such as Cedars Sinai Hospital, a Jewish hospital, but they have essentially become nonsectarian agencies that serve clients or patients regardless of their religion or ethnicity. While we ought not to exaggerate their contributions, nongovernment agencies have provided many benefits; they have, in effect, become partners with the public welfare state. By administering public programs under contract or grants with government, they have provided a network of facilities that allows outreach into every American community. To Americans who feel stigmatized when they use public programs, they provide an acceptable alternative. Less restricted by public regulations and civil service requirements, not-for-profit agencies have often pioneered innovative services. Millions of Americans have enriched their lives by volunteering in not-for-profit agencies—opportunities that would not exist if the nation relied exclusively on public services. The viability of the not-for-profit sector has been threatened during the past two decades, however, by the reluctance of the American welfare state. As public funding of an array of programs has been reduced, not-for-profit agencies have increasingly lost their public contracts and grants. In turn, cuts in public programs have increased competition for the resources of philanthropic agencies and donors, so that hard-pressed not-for- profits have found it difficult to offset cuts in public funds from other nongovernment sources. The result, some critics argue, has been increasing reliance by not-for-profits on the fees and memberships of clients—a reliance that has made them increasingly inaccessible to low-income persons, who lack the resources to pay these charges. The American welfare state also places greater reliance on for- profit agencies, both as freestanding entities that fund themselves from fees or memberships and as partners of public programs that receive government contracts and grants, as well as reimbursements from public programs such as Medicare. Policy analysts do not agree about the relative merits of for-profit agencies and the extent to which their role should expand. For- profit agencies dominate the nursing home industry, own a significant share of American hospitals and child care centers, own a significant share of American psychiatric hospitals and substance abuse programs, and have even entered such areas as prison administration. Deriding the inefficiencies of public programs such as schools, some people want the role of for-profit agencies to be vastly increased through the use of vouchers that allow people to select services from competing (and frequently for-profit) agencies. It is beyond our scope to analyze the relative merits of for-profit agencies in detail. Some provide innovative, high-quality services; others try to increase their profits by making excessive cuts in their programs, as illustrated by poor-quality nursing homes. Some critics see them as profit-maximizing entities that actually increase the costs of services by diverting resources to advertising and to owners’ profits, and point out that they often locate their facilities only in areas where fee-paying clients exist, such as suburban communities. Many defenders of for-profits contend, however, that market competition forces them to provide services that are responsive to consumers’ needs—and some argue that it is virtually impossible to distinguish between the services of for-profits and not-for-profits, which themselves try to maximize their income from fees and from efficiencies. Curiously, the reluctance of the American welfare state may increase the role of for-profits, which can raise capital from private sources—for example, from issuance of stock and from investors’ funds—whereas not-for-profits must rely on increasingly scarce donors and public contracts to accumulate resources. In some cases, funding cuts in the public sector also increase the role of for-profits by enabling them to purchase failing not-for-profit hospitals and other agencies. The diminishing of corruption, patronage, and nepotism in American government institutions in the 20th and 21st centuries as compared with 19th-century and early 20th-century practices, even though considerable corruption still exists, as illustrated by the sentencing of powerful lobbyist Jack Abramoff for conspiracy to bribe public officials in 2005. 4. Social factors include wars, migrations of populations, demographic changes, industrialization, global economic competition, and urbanization—that is, changes in the social environment that created public support for policy reforms. Social factors that have created public awareness and opportunities are: The powerful role of the Great Depression in fostering social and political pressure for enactment of an array of social reforms. Discrimination created by racism, xenophobia, ageism, sexism, prejudice against disabled persons, homophobia, and other kinds of prejudice. Social problems created by industrialization, such as unemployment, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. Social problems created by urbanization, such as unsafe housing, poor sanitation, and lack of open spaces. Social problems created by capitalism, such as economic inequality and discrimination against domestic workers as corporations have moved plants abroad. 5. The sequencing of events describes the effects of the timing of important developments in the evolution of the U.S. welfare state. Sequencing events that provided opportunities to policy advocates include the following: Policy reforms in specific eras (such as the Progressive, New Deal, and Great Society eras) have facilitated reforms in succeeding eras by setting precedents that expanded the horizons of many Americans to include social reforms they might otherwise have been considered to be not feasible. 6. Legal factors have assumed major significance in the development of the American welfare state because of the role of federal and state constitutions, as well as court decisions, in shaping public policies. Legal factors that have provided opportunities for policy advocates include the following: Court rulings that have supported the ability of state and federal governments to develop regulations, civil rights legislation, and social programs, particularly from the late 1930s onward. The emphasis on individual rights in the U.S. Constitution has prompted members of vulnerable populations to invest enormous energy in obtaining legal guarantees of their rights, with notable successes. People with disabilities provide an excellent example. Though Germany often provides better services to individuals with disabilities, it has not developed as much legislation as the United States that accords its residents protections against discrimination in employment, housing, and transportation. The emergence of public interest legal advocacy groups that have brought many successful class action suits on behalf of vulnerable populations. 7. Political factors include power resources and tactics of specific interest groups, legislators, presidents and other chief executives, and professional groups. Political factors that have provided opportunities for policy advocates include the following: Development of large unions in the late 1930s and succeeding decades that have financed relatively liberal political candidates and supported relatively liberal legislation. Some relatively liberal presidents, including Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. The relatively liberal nature of the modern Democratic Party, particularly its Northern wing from the 1930s onward. The ability of social programs to attract additional support for themselves from their beneficiaries, such as elderly persons supporting Medicare and Social Security—and their ability to generate support from providers, such as support for Medicare from hospitals and physicians. Advocacy groups that have sought social policy reforms and have generated widespread support for specific causes such as civil rights, women’s rights, and rights for LGBT persons. The quest of the Republican Party and President Trump to terminate the ACA and to make deep cuts in social programs in 2017 was contested by marches and protests by women, immigrants, the LGBTQ community, persons of color, Black Lives Matter, groups that attended town hall meetings of Republican legislators, and many others. Where Do W e Stand? We have discussed both moral failings and moral successes of the American welfare state in contemporary society. We have placed both of these aspects in the societal context that produced them. We have enumerated an array of contextual factors that have discouraged or constrained social reforms and others that have provided opportunities. Where does our study of the evolution of the American welfare state, then, leave us in contemporary society? It demonstrates that our relationship to the American welfare state is strikingly similar to those of policy advocates of prior eras. While we benefit from many social reforms that have been enacted in prior eras in contemporary society, we also confront an array of moral defects in the American welfare state—just as they did. We, too, use ethical reasoning to distinguish right from wrong. While we can have honest differences among ourselves as to the ethical merit of specific policies, we will often concur that many social policies are ethically flawed. We, too, draw on evidence-based findings when they exist. Just as they did, we confront both constraining and facilitating contextual factors. We, too, have to select those policy reforms that we wish to prioritize. We, too, have to navigate the American welfare state to decide where we will focus our policy advocacy by selecting the level of government, the not-for-profit or for-profit sector, a specific agency or a network of agencies, and a specific policy sector—or some combination of these factors. Like policy advocates of prior eras, we, too, have to place issues on decision makers’ agendas, analyze problems, develop proposals, enact policy reforms, secure effective implementation of policies, and assess implemented policies to see if they are effective. Our discussion in this chapter suggests that the policy advocacy framework in Figure 2.1 is just as relevant to contemporary Americans as it was to policy advocates in prior eras. Standing on the Shoulders of Policy Advocates Curiously, conservatives are more adept than liberals at identifying their historical roots; they boast of their affinity with many of the ideas of the founding fathers, for example. Indeed, some conservatives equate their ideology with patriotism itself, with the obvious implication that reformers possess alien ideas. For all its faults and omissions, however, social reform in the United States has a rich and vibrant tradition that is just as integral to the nation’s history as conservatism. Jane Addams exhorted Americans to define patriotism in the context of cooperative or sharing values rather than militaristic or competitive values and to find the meaning of their society from the altruism that was so evident in immigrant communities and among women. Reform ideas can sometimes be found in unlikely places. For example, Jefferson and many of the founding fathers were afraid that undue differences in wealth might cause social turmoil and demoralize persons in the lower economic strata. Dwight Eisenhower, who committed his life to a career in the military, warned of “the conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry” and urged Americans to “guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence by the military-industrial complex.” * Reformers should not forget that conservative eras have been followed by liberal periods since the inception of the republic. It is worth remembering that abolitionists, progressives, New Dealers, and liberal reformers of the 1960s had their formative experiences not during reform periods but during the conservative eras that preceded them. Many reformers had despaired that their nation would again experience reform and had become accustomed to hearing rhetoric to the effect that conservative trends would dominate the nation for decades. Conservatives in the Gilded Age, the 1920s, the 1950s, the 1990s, and the present era had confidently predicted that the nation would experience unending prosperity and that its citizens would gratefully pay homage to corporate and conservative officials by choosing them to lead the nation. In each case, however, the nation had soon embarked on social reform, whether because citizens had tired of the narcissism and materialism of conservative eras; because of catastrophic events such as the Great Depression; because of popular anger against the exploitation of women, children, workers, or African Americans; or because of the failures of conservative policy prescriptions such as trickle-down economics, limited government, and unregulated markets. In our analysis, we have emphasized the materialistic and individualistic characteristics of American culture, but these qualities coexist with altruism and other moral principles. Some social scientists contend that Americans have both private and public tendencies. However, materialism and personal goals prevail during conservative periods, altruism and concern about societal needs prevail during liberal periods. This insight into American culture, which is confirmed historically by the rhythm of conservative and reform periods, suggests that reformers can successfully appeal to those aspects of American culture that emphasize assistance to innocent victims, assurance of equal rights, and provision of resources to needy people. * (See Figure 14.5 .) Figure 14.5. Details Library of Congress Young women demonstrating against child labor during the Progressive Era. Reformers should realize, too, that social reform is possible even during conservative periods. Fine and Chambers, respectively, note that reformers obtained some successes even during the Gilded Age and the 1920s. * Partly because many Americans remembered how New Deal programs saved them from the hardships of the Great Depression, President Eisenhower did not attack those social programs that had survived World War II, and he even made substantial additions to the Social Security Act. We have noted that, in the 1970s, conservative presidents consented to increases in social spending that equaled those of the 1960s. Although President Reagan made devastating cuts in means-tested programs, his major cuts occurred during the first year of his presidency. Indeed, public opinion polls suggest that he did not markedly change American policy preferences on domestic matters during his presidency and that most Americans favored retention (or even expansion) of existing federal social programs. * Reagan felt compelled to agree that he would preserve safety net programs from cuts. When he tried to frontally attack Social Security and Medicare, he suffered stinging defeats during both his first and second terms. Indeed, David Stockman, who favored sweeping cuts in social spending, noted remorsefully in 1986 that the Reagan revolution had failed. * Democratic candidates at local, state, and congressional levels bucked the national Republican trends not only in the 1980s but also in the 1920s and the 1950s. Both Eisenhower and Reagan had to contend with powerful Democratic contingents in both chambers of Congress—and in state and local governments—that resisted cuts in social spending. Many pundits argued that the Republicans’ electoral triumph in 1994 when they captured control of both houses of Congress presaged extended Republican domination of national politics. Instead, Democrats made major electoral gains in 1996 and 1998—and threatened to retake control of the House in 2000, 2002, and 2004, finally succeeding with majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate in 2006, where one of their first acts was to increase the minimum wage. They helped elect President Barack Obama in 2008, as well as gaining huge majorities in both chambers of Congress. Reformers in conservative eras such as the 1950s and 1980s, as well as during the presidencies of George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump succeeded in blocking many measures that would have markedly curtailed or eliminated important social programs. They prevented conservatives from block-granting Medicaid, privatizing Social Security and Medicare, and ending affirmative action. Blocking such measures is as essential to policy advocacy as initiating new social reforms. Reformers should also note the rich traditions of resistance within the many groups that have experienced discrimination in the United States. The emphasis in the late 1960s and the 1970s on the rights of women, African Americans, gay men and lesbians, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native Americans had the salutary effect of making these groups more aware of historical reformers and of the possibility of political redress for grievances. A reform heritage has arisen to challenge conservative mythology; the formerly obscure names of distant and courageous persons have been brought to light, along with infamous events and persecutions. Discovery of older reform traditions has stimulated many Americans to become involved in social reform today. During the nation’s history, reformers have often benefited from the pragmatism of the American people, who tend to place problem solving above ideology. Conservatives can preach free-market and limited- government ideology, but Americans are unlikely to follow their dictates if they believe that assertive interventions are needed to redress pressing problems. Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Barack Obama adeptly contrasted their activist, interventionist policies with the passivity of conservative politicians. Even some white, male, blue-collar voters who turned away from the Democratic Party in the 1980s may come to realize that, in an era of economic globalization and extreme job insecurity, they can benefit from social policies such as vocational training. A poll conducted by The New York Times in 1996 found that 63% of Americans who had been hard hit by layoffs believed the government “should step in to do something about layoffs and loss of jobs” as compared with only 42% of those still untouched by layoffs. * As in preceding eras, a central challenge to reformers in the early part of the 21st century is to make the health of the welfare state an issue of concern to many of the groups who are becoming increasingly influential in the nation’s politics. Elderly voters have medical and social welfare needs that are poorly addressed by existing policies. Workers in the service sector, including clerical and sales personnel, receive limited fringe benefits and are increasingly being supplanted by temporary workers. Women have trouble finding and paying for quality child care, often receive low wages, and face discriminatory hiring and promotion policies. Latino voters in Southwestern states contend with problems of poverty, poor education, and substance abuse. African Americans have high unemployment rates and would benefit from a variety of educational and social welfare benefits. Many young people realize that their economic prospects are bleaker than those of their parents. Immigrants are subject to harassment by government authorities. Reformers may despair at the difficulties of establishing coalitions of the disparate groups that have the most to gain from expansion of the welfare state, but coalitions of reform-oriented groups have occurred at numerous points in the nation’s history. We noted in Chapter 5 that immigrant, middle-class, and working-class voters supported progressive politicians. Franklin Roosevelt fashioned a coalition of blue-collar workers, people of color, intellectuals, Jews, and ethnic populations that maintained considerable cohesion during the three decades following the New Deal. Although this liberal coalition frayed during the 1970s and 1980s, it can be restored if the separate hardships of different groups lead their members to believe that reform- oriented candidates are again needed. But reformers will need to be skillful in forging coalitions in a society riven by racism and economic rivalry. They need to construct proposals that address the needs of diverse groups and to develop broad-based support for social reforms. By understanding American social welfare history, social reformers can gain a greater sense of their importance and can also take courage from the endurance of their predecessors. However, analysis of this history should also prompt expanded definitions of reform. More than the liberal reformers of past eras, today’s reformers need to broaden their concerns to include tax policies, economic planning, budget priorities, and military spending, all of which have important consequences for social welfare policy as we have discussed in preceding chapters. Traditionally, social welfare policy has focused on income maintenance or public welfare, child welfare, mental health, and housing. Although these policies are vitally important, social reformers must broaden their activities as well. In coming decades, social reformers need to emphasize the positive roles of social programs in helping the nation cope with the globalized economy. Large segments of society will be left behind as the importance of technological skills increases. Changing careers many times in their lives, Americans will need continuing access to education; they will need medical programs that are not provided by particular employers; and they will need income supports during their transitions between jobs. In short, they will need an array of social programs to help them cope with economic and career uncertainties. Moreover, reformers should advocate policies to reduce economic inequality. The wealth of the highest quintile exceeds 10 times that of the lowest quintile. This extraordinary difference offends the principle of social justice and contributes to the economic suffering of persons in the lowest economic strata. Despite its importance, this issue has been missing from the agendas of most reformers in preceding eras. Finally, social reformers should not be timid about making explicit reference to the values that justify their proposals. When Harry Hopkins told critics of his New Deal programs that relieving hunger was not debatable, he affirmed the principles of beneficence, social justice, and equality. Recognize the Journey toward Policy Practice and Policy Advocacy EP 3b Social reformers in American history rarely achieved their successes without investing time and effort—and without developing specific policy- changing skills. No matter how meritorious they may be, policy proposals fail if their proponents do not gain the support of decision makers, whether in legislatures, organizations, or communities. Reformers like Dorothea Dix, Jane Addams, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Cesar Chavez, Martin Luther King, and Marian Wright Edelman were actively involved in the political process for decades. Some professionals take a dim view of politics; they regard those involved in politics as opportunistic, power-hungry, or wedded to special interests. It is difficult to imagine a world where politics does not exist, however, because political processes provide the means for addressing the many value-laden issues in policy making. The political playing field often is not level, as social policy history repeatedly demonstrates. Advocates for corporations possess greater resources to hire lobbyists and engage in public relations campaigns than do advocates for stigmatized populations. The organized electorate readily throws its support behind some issues, such as tax cuts, while proposals to fund a guaranteed income or a children’s allowance, for example, often LO 14-12 attract less support. Far from curing or improving politics, social reformers who withdraw from the political process simply strengthen its inequities. People who prize social justice, fairness, and beneficence need to develop organizational, community, and legislative skills in policy practice and policy advocacy. I define policy practice as efforts to change policies in legislative, agency, and community settings, whether by establishing new policies, improving existing ones, or defeating the policy initiatives of other people. People who are skilled in policy practice increase the odds that their policy preferences will be advanced. I define policy advocacy as policy practice that aims to help powerless groups, such as women, children, poor people, persons of color, gay men and lesbians, and people with disabilities, to improve their resources and opportunities. * This text has provided many examples of policy practice and policy advocacy. Each of the many profiles in policy practice and advocacy included at the ends of Chapters 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 demonstrates how determined, principled, persistent, and skilled individuals have been able to change policies, even in the face of adversity. Let’s contrast some approaches to securing policy changes that are illustrated by historical events. Participating in Social Movements Welfare recipients in the early 1960s were treated unfairly by many welfare offices across the nation. African Americans were often denied benefits in Southern states, in defiance of federal regulations that prohibited racial discrimination in the administration of AFDC. Even in Northern welfare offices, they often endured long waits, slow processing of claims, underpayments of benefits, and derogatory treatment by staff. Sparked by Geor ge Wiley, a national welfare rights movement was initiated in the early 1960s. With the help of community workers hired by settlement houses and other agencies, local chapters of welfare recipients were organized, not only to pressure local offices to be more responsive but to initiate lawsuits to force compliance with federal regulations. Wiley headed the National Welfare Rights Organization, which sought to raise federal standards for benefits. Establishing Advocacy Organizations Having participated in the civil rights movement, as well as antipoverty programs to help children in Mississippi, Marian Wright Edelman formed the Children’s Defense Fund in 1973. Securing grants from foundations and private donors, she developed research and lobbying capabilities that she used to document a variety of problems encountered by the nation’s children—in particular, inadequacies in the implementation of programs such as the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980. She lobbied assertively for many pieces of legislation and played a key role in the enactment of the child care and development block grant of 1990, which provided the first major federal subsidies for child care in peacetime. Seeking Social Reforms from within the Government Wilbur Cohen’s long career in the federal government, where he held various appointments in the executive branch in the Roosevelt, Truman, and Johnson administrations, illustrates the tactics of officials who work inside bureaucracies. He favored what he called a salami approach to social reform; that is, he sought incremental slices that, when finally put together, represented major changes. Using this approach, he was able to gradually transform Social Security from merely an old age pension to a family assistance program that provides benefits (and financial aid for college education) to surviving members of families who have lost a parent. He also helped to secure benefits from Social Security for persons with permanent disabilities. As an advocate for Social Security from inside government, he cultivated personal relationships with an extraordinary number of politicians from both parties and sought to construct policies that would help them gain the support of their constituents. * Educating the Public as a Prelude to Social Reforms Dorothea Dix was one of the most remarkable figures in American social policy history. Overhearing a conversation in 1841 about the treatment of “prisoners and lunatics” in East Cambridge, Massachusetts, she decided to visit the facility. Shocked by the conditions, she visited every jail and almshouse in Massachusetts and accumulated statistics and details that she presented in a “Memorial” to the state legislature. She included many personal cases; for example, she reported that, in the almshouse at Danvers, she saw a young woman exhibiting a condition of neglect and misery blotting out the faintest idea of comfort … there she stood, clinging to, or beating upon, the bars of her caged apartment … the unwashed frame invested with fragments of unclean garments; the air so extremely offensive … that it was not possible to remain beyond a few moments … irritation of the body, produced by utter filth and exposure, incited her to the horrid process of tearing off her skin by inches, her face, neck, and person were thus disfigured to hideousness. * Her first Memorial had an enormous impact and prompted angry denunciations of her as a liar and sensationalist. Community leaders rallied to her side as they confirmed her findings, and a rising tide of public indignation forced the hand of the state’s legislators, who funded space for 200 persons in the mental asylum in Worcester. She followed the same course in about 20 other states. In one 3-year period, she traveled 10,000 miles by horseback, carriage, and steamboat and visited 300 county jails and 500 almshouses. She not only presented Memorials but also got to know legislators; she had influential people bring them to her room or alcove in the state capitol, where she talked to 15 or 20 at a time. Realizing that many states lacked revenues to fund mental institutions, she often had to persuade legislators to enact taxes as well. In 1854, she persuaded both chambers of Congress to enact legislation that would grant the proceeds from land sales to the states for the construction of mental institutions, only to have President Pierce veto the legislation. Electing Reform-Oriented Candidates to Ofﬁce Realizing that its tax-exempt status as a not-for-profit organization could be threatened by direct participation in partisan politics, the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) formed PACE in 1975. Funded by contributions from NASW’s membership and keeping its accounts separate from NASW, PACE asks political candidates in state and federal elections to respond to a questionnaire that probes their positions on social issues. Candidates who are approved by PACE receive contributions for their campaigns. Many reformers have taken positions in the campaigns of specific candidates or have worked in local campaign offices on tasks such as media relations, outreach to voters, or fundraising. Beginning with Jane Addams’s work in helping form the Progressive Party in 1912, many social reformers have worked for political parties at the national or state level. Some social workers have sought elective office; for example, Democrat Ron Dellums was regularly reelected to the House of Representatives from the Eighth District in Berkeley, California—an area now represented by his successor, Barbara Lee, also a social worker. Dellums went on to become the mayor of Oakland, California. Nine other members of Congress are social workers, including two U.S. senators, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. Inﬂuencing Policy from Organizational Settings Often working with advocacy groups and professional associations, social workers have sought to influence the policies of legislative bodies from their positions in specific agencies. The situation for rape victims was bleak in the early 1970s, when they were commonly assumed to have incited attacks by their clothing or demeanor. Hospital staff often treated them with contempt in emergency rooms and failed even to collect evidence in a manner that could be used by the district attorney. Rules of evidence in court often allowed the accused offender to place the woman on trial; for example, his attorney could question her about her prior sexual liaisons. Nor did rape victims receive monetary compensation from the state, even though other crime victims were often remunerated for injuries and lost time from work. Concerned that Los Angeles County failed to provide humane services for victims of rape, Gail Abarbanel, a social worker who directs the Rape Treatment Center at California’s Santa Monica Hospital, developed a coalition that proceeded to pressure hospitals, the police department, and the district attorney to put in place new policies for treating rape victims and prosecuting offenders. Whistleblowing The progressive reformer Homer Folks illustrates how some reformers have sought policy reforms in the agencies and institutions that implement social policies. He was astonished to find, in the early 20th century, that mental institutions in New York State were riddled with corruption and hired staff on the basis of personal friendships. Working from outside the institutions, he mobilized pressure to force the state governor to implement a variety of reforms. In some cases, social workers have obtained changes of agency policies while holding positions within them. Many of these reforms occur in low- conflict and undramatic fashion—for example, when a staff member alerts his or her supervisor to a dysfunctional policy or inadequate implementation of a meritorious policy. Staff sometimes believe that serious wrongdoing occurs in their agencies but find that they cannot challenge the unethical practices through ordinary channels for fear that they will lose their jobs. In these rare cases—and only after considerable contemplation— social workers can divulge their concerns to outside agencies or professional organizations. Understand How to Move beyond History to Policy Advocacy in Contemporary Society EP 5a While social welfare history has great merit independent of social work practice in contemporary society, it also prepares us to become better social workers in our own professional practice. LO 14-13 Acquiring Policy Advocacy Skills No matter how policy advocates attempt to reform specific social policies— or to create policies where none exist—they need to engage skillfully in policy changing work if they wish to increase the probability that they will succeed. Just as in clinical, administrative, and community work, social workers need to learn how to be skillful policy advocate practitioners— following the examples of the policy advocates we have identified in specific historical eras, such as Dorothea Dix, Eleanor Roosevelt, Wilbur Cohen, Cesar Chavez, Whitney Young, Ron Dellums, and Barbara Mikulski. Social welfare history provides an introduction to policy advocacy by developing our ethical reasoning and navigational skills, as well as our ability to diagnose context. It exposes us to the work of policy advocates from the colonial period to the present. It helps us understand how policy advocates must place issues on policy agendas, analyze social problems, develop policy proposals, implement policies, and assess policies. Unlike policy advocates in specific historical eras, contemporary social workers can draw upon an emerging body of professional literature that discusses policy practice and policy advocacy as interventions—literature that has emerged only recently. A variety of texts on policy advocacy now exist, including my own, now in its sixth edition ( Becoming an Effective Policy Advocate , 8th edition, Cengage Learning, 2018). Growing numbers of departments and schools of social work are providing semester-long courses in policy advocacy, requiring students to engage in it during their field placements, and asking students to attend statewide lobbying days in their state capitols. Many students engage in policy advocacy projects. Social workers should seek ways to engage in policy advocacy during their professional education in departments and schools of social work—even if their schools or departments do not offer semester-long courses in policy advocacy. (To see examples of policy advocacy projects of social work students around the nation, go to the website of an important national social work organization, Influencing State Policy, at http://www.statepolicy.org .) You should ask yourself whether during your professional education you can use the skills identified in Figure 2.1 in this book, including ethical reasoning skills —already sharpened by your study of social welfare history —to identify a flaw or omission in existing social policies, whether in specific agencies, communities, counties, or states, or at the federal level— or in some combination of these locations. You should seek to develop your navigational skills to enable you to decide what specific policies, and in what location, need to be reformed. (You will often have several options since social policies relevant to specific social problems often exist in many locations.) Navigational skills are needed, as well, to identify existing advocacy groups, public officials, religious institutions, concerned citizens, or professional organizations that are (or might become) interested in policy advocacy with respect to the issue or problem that you have selected. In many cases, you will discover that policy advocacy work is already under way—or that you can persuade others to initiate it when you inform them why you believe an existing policy is ethically flawed. You should seek to develop your context-reading skills so that you can discover contextual factors that both facilitate and impede specific policy reforms. Your knowledge of the context may lead you to favor certain policy reforms while dropping others as you decide what is feasible to enact in light of the context that you encounter. You should seek to develop your agenda-setting skills so that the policy reform that you seek can be placed on the agendas of decision makers in whatever location you have chosen for your policy advocacy work. You should develop your problem-analyzing skills, proposal-writing skills , and policy-enacting skills as you move toward actually developing and enacting policy proposals. You should develop troubleshooting or implementing skills as you realize that many meritorious enacted policies are inadequately implemented after they are enacted. You should develop policy-assessing skills to enhance your ability to gain evidence about the effectiveness of those policies that are enacted. As discussed in Figure 2.1 , social workers use the eight advocacy skills not only to engage in macro policy advocacy, but to engage in micro policy advocacy and mezzo policy advocacy. They help clients receive services for which they are eligible and to obtain quality and preventive services in micro policy advocacy. They work to improve agency policies and to improve community policies in mezzo policy advocacy. Leaving a Better W elfare State for Future Generations Our challenge is to use our knowledge of social welfare history to help us become policy advocates in contemporary society. As we understand how policy advocates have made the American welfare state more humane over a period of several centuries, we realize that we can stand on their shoulders to continue their work by making policy practice and policy advocacy integral to our professional role. By participating in the shaping of contemporary policies, we join reforming pioneers of the past, adding our strands to a tapestry that is beautiful to behold but never finished. Access the MindTap to read “Developing Policy Advocacy Background Documents, Op_Ed Articles, and Policy Briefs.” It discusses how to write policy background papers that can be transmitted to policy makers to inform them about specific social reforms they might consider. It uses the issue of homelessness. Historical background material can be used, as well, to develop a two-page “policy brief” that describes a specific proposal—as well as ways to write letters to the editor and op-ed essays that can be transmitted to specific newspaper in your jurisdiction and elsewhere. By engaging in these projects, you are engaging in policy practice. Learning Outcomes After reading this chapter, you are now equipped to: Identify how the American welfare state is “reluctant” in comparison with many European welfare states—and place the American welfare state in a historical and comparative context. Discuss ethical shortcomings of the American welfare state with respect to eight social problems in contemporary society. Identify specific cultural, economic, institutional, social, sequential, and political factors that contributed to the reluctance of the American welfare state. Identify an array of reforms that have positive ethical merit in specific policy sectors and with respect to specific vulnerable populations. Give examples of specific cultural, economic, institutional, social, sequential, and political factors that contributed to the enactment of meritorious social policies. Critique widely used arguments that suggest that the United States does not need a welfare state—or that it can rely on deterrence, volunteers, and other panaceas. Assert the case for a welfare state, while admitting the limitations of public policy to solve major social problems. Identify ways in which we can use our knowledge of social welfare history to promote policy advocacy in contemporary society so that we stand on the shoulders of policy advocates from prior eras.
