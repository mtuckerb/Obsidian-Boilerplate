Please use the following ques tions as a guide to ensuring that your paper is compr ehensive and covers the breadth of what generalist social work pr actice encompasses. In addition to the sub-sections outlined below, you should be sure to include both introductory and concluding par agraphs. Your final paper may be between 8-10 pag es. I. Family Assessment (s trengths and resources; social functioning, pr oblem definitions) (4-6 pag es) This part of the paper should demonstrate your ability to integrate the information and concep ts from the course (s ystems, empo werment, strengths per spectiv e, self-determination, diversity, cultural humility, values and ethics, etc.) into your discussion of the Fadiman book. Do not simply write answers to the ques tions individually, but use them as a guide for formulating your overall assessment of the family’s experience. Please cite evidence from the book and incorpor ate citations from the text and various peer -reviewed articles as you consider your responses to these ques tions: 1. What is the nature of the pr oblem the Lee family encounters? How do they define the pr oblem? 2. What is the client system’s per cep tion of the intensity and duration of the pr oblem (long-t erm, short-term, or crisis)? 3. What has the client system attemp ted as solutions? 4. Who else is affected by the pr oblem and how are they affected? Consider if the issue is a per sonal pr oblem or could be seen as a social issue, for example. 5. What is the client’s per cep tion of social work intervention and of other involved helper s? 6. How does the pr oblem affect the social functioning of the client system? 7. Since social workers should oper ate from a strengths per spectiv e, identify which client system strengths and environmental assets you believe can be directed toward change. 8. The values and principles used by various pr ofessionals are import ant to the outcomes in the book. How would you compar e the intervention styles and appr oaches of (a) Neil Ernst and Peggy Philp (b) Jeannine Hilt, through a values lens? 9. Were there ethical dilemmas in this case? If so, what values were in conflict and how would pr opose to resolve any dilemmas? 10. What issues related to diversity are relevant here? How would your new knowledge of the cultural history of the Hmong people guide you if you were to work with this family? A. GENOGRAM: (½ - 1 pag e) Draw a genogram that repr esents at least 3 generations of the Lee family. You need not name every single-family member as long as you repr esent at least 3 generational levels and the most significant relationship s mentioned in the book. Please include a key that translates any symbols or abbreviations and pr ovide a brief explana tion of the genogram, incorpor ated into the paper ’s introduction or wherever you deem it appr opria te. B. ECOMAP: (½ - 1 pag e) Identify and pr esent an illustration of the social systems that interact with and influence the Lee family and Lia Lee, specific ally. As you did with the genogram, choose where in the body of your paper you will depict the relationship s between Lia and the Lees, and the systems you see as import ant for them. Add a brief explana tion of the ecomap. II. Reflections (2 - 3 pag es) ● What is your reaction to this book? Why do you think you had this reaction? ● Imagine that you are a social worker in one of these settings: the hospit al, the foster care pr ogram, the school system. What roles and functions would be import ant for you to perf orm as you engage with the family (y ou may name specific family members to explain your poin ts)? ● What have you learnt about diversity that would help you as a pr ofessional social worker if you were working with someone, a family or a group of individuals who pr esented as different from you?
