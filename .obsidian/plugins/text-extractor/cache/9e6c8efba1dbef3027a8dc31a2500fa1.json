It is the sole responsibility of the end user to ensure that the installation, operation, and maintenance of this product comply with all applicable local, state, and national electrical and safety regulations. By using this product, you acknowledge that it is supplied \"as is\" and that you assume full responsibility for any risks associated with its use. The supplier of this PCB assumes no liability for any damage, injury, or loss of any kind, whether direct or indirect, resulting from the use, misuse, or inability to use the hardware, software, or associated components provided. It is strongly recommended that users seek professional advice and services to ensure compliance with relevant safety standards and to avoid potential hazards. Wiring information: Keep wire length to a minimum: Plan the mounting position of the PCB in a location that reduces the cable length to the various sensors you plan on using. Longer cables can reduce the signal quality from various sensors. Use shielded cable: It’s good practice to use shielded cable between the sensors and PCB. This reduces electrical interference that can impact the quality of the signal. The outer shielding of the cable should be connected to any of the GND terminals on the PCB. Note: Only connect one end of the shielding to GND Display cable: The OLED display connections (SDA and SCL) are particularly sensitive to electrical interference. It is vital to use shielded cable with one end of the shielding connected to any GND on the PCB. It is recommended to keep the cable length to a minimum (max recommended length is 400mm). PCB Overview DC Power NOTE: The onboard 5V PSU has a maximum current output of 2A. This is more than sufficient to operate the PCB and all the sensors connected. However, if you connect additional accessories to the 5V supply, ensure that you are not exceeding the 2Amp current limit of the PSU. 100 ~ 240VAC Input and Relay Outputs NOTES: 1. You’ll find dual “LIVE” power inputs on the board. Both must be connected to LIVE for all the relay outputs to function. The reason for dual inputs is each terminal is rated for 10A maximum. By having 2 Live terminals, the total maximum LIVE output current is rated at 20A. 2. For inductive loads such as mechanical relays, solenoid valves. Etc, it may be necessary to install a metal oxide varistor to reduce inductive kickback which can prevent the on board zero-crossing solid state relays from turning off.

It is vital to use shielded cable with one end of the shielding connected to any GND on the PCB. It is recommended to keep the cable length to a minimum (max recommended length is 400mm). Flow Meters Single flow meter setup A single high-pressure rated flow meter is the easiest configuration to calibrate. The flow meter should be installed in a location close to the group head, and after any pressure regulators. Pros: Easy to calibrate and accurate. Cons: high pressure flow meters are expensive. Dual flow meter setup In a dual flow meter configuration, FM1 measures the volume of water going to the pump. Any water that is bleed off by pressure regulators is measured by FM2 before being returned to the tank. Pros: Low pressure flow meters are cheaper. Cons: Difficult to calibrate and achieve accurate results.
