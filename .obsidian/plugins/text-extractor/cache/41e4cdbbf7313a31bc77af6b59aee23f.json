Understanding and respecting differences in culture are critical to building a successful working alliance with the child and family that you support. Upon Completion of Module 4, you will:  Define culture and understand how it shapes beliefs and values.  Understand how to effectively manage value conflicts.  Understand how to provide culturally competent service.  Define family and understand principles of family functioning.  Identify phases of family development.  Understand the multiple challenges families may experience and develop strategies for supporting healthy family functioning. Culture The Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary defines culture as: “…a: the integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and behavior that depends upon man’s capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations b: the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group c: the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes a company or corporation.” Culture is a universal experience with diverse roots. It is the set of beliefs, traditions, and values that shape who we become as well as how we view ourselves and others. Culture is transmitted from one generation to the next. We begin to experience culture from the moment we are born, and it continues to influence throughout our lives. BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 6 An iceberg is one way to conceptualize culture. Some features of icebergs are visible, above the surface of the water. However, much of an iceberg exists beneath the surface. Culture consists of visible behaviors and practices that are influenced by core values deeply rooted within us. As with an iceberg, there are things that we can see and describe easily and then there are deeply rooted ideas that we can only understand by analyzing values, studying institutions, and in many cases, reflecting on our own core values. BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 7 Features of Culture Each of us has been influenced by various features of culture. These features of culture are influenced by a variety of factors and have been shaped over time. For each feature of culture below, record one or two examples common to your family while you were growing up. • Example: say \"hello\" and shake hands; or, give and receive a kiss on each cheek. Greeting others Personal space/privacy Role of family Celebrations General worldview Raising/Disciplining children Education BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 8 Culture is a major predictor of values. Values are initially established within families and cultures and are a driving force behind how a group sees the world. Therefore, cultural differences often lead to value conflicts. These types of value conflicts can be uncomfortable and difficult to handle because resolutions rely on our willingness and ability to increase tolerance for our differences. No matter how persuasive the rationale, values are not usually altered. Arguing and attempting to persuade someone to agree with our perspective are not effective tactics for managing value conflicts. Asking someone to change her values is essentially asking that person to alter her reality or change the way that she sees the world. Managing Value Conflicts When we interact with individuals whose backgrounds, cultures, and values differ from our own, it is not unusual for misunderstandings and even conflicts to arise. The greater the difference between cultures, the greater the opportunity for misunderstanding to occur. Values influence what we perceive to be the best ways to accomplish various tasks and make progress toward goals and objectives. This issue can be especially challenging in your work as a BHP because it requires setting aside the values and ideas that are deeply ingrained in you in order to be able to assist the child and family with achieving their goals and objectives. Think of something that was inherent to the way you grew up and has shaped your perspective and ideals. For example, if you were raised in a household that was neat and uncluttered, walking into a home that is disorganized might be a shock. Moreover, you may experience a negative reaction about the abilities of the family with which you are working. An instinctual reaction can lead to snap judgments that are unfair to the family and may undermine your effectiveness as a BHP. You must become aware of potential value conflicts and how these impact your work with families. The children and families you are working with and their identified goals and objectives should always be your primary focus areas. Learning strategies to reduce the impact of value conflicts is essential to your work as a BHP. BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 9 Potential Value Conflicts CLEANLINESS/ TIDINESS Different households will adhere to various standards of cleanliness. If the family that you work with tends to hold onto clutter while you are more of a minimalist, what are the ways in which the cleanliness or tidiness of a family's living space presents a value conflict? Conversely, you may tend to hold onto things, while the home you work in is extremely organized and structured with the expectation that everything is in its place. NUTRITION Think of the kinds of food that the adults in your life offered to you when you were younger. If your caregivers often relied on takeout for meals, potential exists for a value conflict with a family that does not allow their children to eat fast food. Or maybe you are very nutrition-conscious, but the child with whom you work will only eat certain foods or is permitted to eat/drink things that you believe to be unhealthy. How can you manage this difference? RELIGION/ POLITICS Religion and politics present us with subject matter that should not affect our relationships with families. However, if families choose to discuss their views in front of or with you, it is important to maintain healthy professional boundaries. What are some ways in which these topics could present value conflicts? PARENTING STYLES Parents are faced with many choices regarding how they run their households and raise their children. Schedules, meals, discipline, hygiene, sleeping arrangements, and screen time are a few examples of these choices. Aside from instances of abuse or neglect, it is best to approach your work with the mindset that caregivers are doing the best that they can with the tools they have. TIME/ PUNCTUALITY The importance of time varies among families and cultures. There are two main concepts of time: - Monochronic involves people adjusting to schedules. - Polychronic involves schedules adjusting to people. If you view time as a priority - adhering to a schedule, being punctual - what potential value conflicts might arise when working with a family who has a polychronic view? Note: The United States, Canada, and Northern Europe tend to be monochronic. Latin American, the Middle East, and Sub-Sahara African cultures are more polychronic. EDUCATION Families may have different beliefs and expectations regarding education that impact the caregiver’s involvement in their child’s education and may influence their child’s attendance and participation in school. For example, some parents are actively involved in their child’s school life, attending extra-curricular activities and events. Parents who are less involved may be perceived as uncaring or uninvested in the child’s education. However, the cultural norm for a parent may be to regard teachers and professionals as the experts, and parent involvement is perceived as unwelcomed or an intrusion. EYE CONTACT In the Western world, making eye contact during conversation is considered polite. When addressed by adults, children may be told, \"Please look at me when I am talking to you.\" However, it is important to note that some cultures view eye contact as a sign of disrespect, and children show respect by avoiding direct eye contact with adults. What is the potential for misunderstanding between an adult who views eye contact as a sign of disrespect and a child who has been taught to look at adults when spoken to? BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 10 Since value conflicts are common, how can we manage them when they arise? The first step is to recognize them. By acknowledging that a conflict exists within a relationship, efforts can be made to increase understanding, acceptance, and effective communication and collaboration. Since culture can be a deeply personal experience, it is important that you recognize how features of culture can contribute to value conflicts between you and the families that you work with. For each feature of culture below, record one or two examples common to the families you work with. Are there differences between your personal list on page 7 and the list below? Greeting others Personal space/privacy Role of family Celebrations General worldview Raising/Disciplining children Education BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 11 One of the most helpful ways to approach a value conflict is to remember that you and the children and families you serve are working toward the same goals. You may have different ideas about the best way to achieve those goals. In some situations, this difference of opinions can contribute to a competitive or win-lose mentality that is counterproductive to the work being done. Instead, focus on the commonalities. Calling attention to things that the Treatment Team/IEP Team and family agree on can be an effective way to embark on a more tolerant path. The value conflict may not ever truly dissipate, but it can be managed with awareness and respect. It is important to remember that you may need to call upon your supervisor to help navigate more challenging value conflicts or issues that continue to affect the work that you are trying to do. Supervision is the best resource for sorting out these types of interactions or for obtaining clarification when you are unsure about how best to proceed. Family as Culture The concept of culture is most often associated with ethnicity and countries of origin. Most people do not consider that their family has its own culture. However, the Merriam-Webster definitions of culture introduced in the beginning of this module (one of which is, “the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group”) are applicable to families. A family is a social group with a characteristic way of thinking, feeling, judging, and acting; in other words, a family has a unique culture. Children are born into family cultures that influence their beliefs and assumptions about what is right, wrong, good, or bad. The shaping of these beliefs and assumptions can be direct or indirect. Some beliefs and values held by a family’s culture may be openly discussed among its members, while others may trickle down as a result of habits and observation. Family culture evolves and adapts in response to many different factors. Specific events such as birth, death, marriage, divorce, and relocation have the power to cause cultural shifts within family units. These events may necessitate a change in roles and responsibilities of family members, which in turn requires the family to acclimate to a new way of doing things. Shifts in a family’s culture can also be more gradual and indicative of changes to the world around them. Regardless of the factors that influence the changes in a family’s culture, it is important to be mindful of the effort that a family has made to adapt to these BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 12 changes and the types of supports that they may need (Council on Foundations, 2015). Since we all have originated from some form of family culture, you must be aware of the potential for value conflicts to arise when you are working in the home with families. Value conflicts can exist in many different areas, and they have the potential to derail the work that you and the family are doing together. Cultural Competence Cultural competence is the ability to effectively deliver services to children and their families in cross-cultural situations. According to Georgetown University, Center for Child and Human Development (n.d.), there are five key elements to providing culturally competent services that the Treatment Team should embrace: • Value diversity – Accepting and respecting differences in culture that you may encounter with the families you serve. Are you curious about the child and family’s culture and what can you learn from how they do things? By embracing diversity as an opportunity for personal and professional growth, you value diversity. • Self-assessment – Considering and recognizing your initial judgments regarding a different culture or race due to stereotypes or past experiences. Do you have insight into your belief system and how these beliefs influence your behavior? Consider how your actions may be interpreted by someone with a different background from your own. • Consciousness of dynamics – Being aware of factors affecting cross- cultural interactions. When value conflicts arise, do you consider how the cultural expectations of the individuals involved may be affecting the situation? • Incorporation of cross-cultural knowledge – Incorporating the knowledge gained through cross-cultural experiences into your practices. As part of your professional development, are you continually learning about the culture of the children and families that you serve? • Adaptation – Changing methods and activities to fit cultural norms. When you are aware of a cultural norm, are you willing to modify your behavior to fit it? In your role as a BHP, are you struggling to make BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 13 certain modifications? Are you unwilling to make some of these modifications? If so, how will this be communicated and resolved? Low-Context/High-Context Communication When working with families in the home, it is important to have an awareness of how family members communicate with one another. Understanding the difference between high-context and low-context communication can provide insight. Michelle LeBaron (2003), author of Bridging Cultural Conflicts, explains: As people communicate, they move along a continuum between high- context and low-context. Depending on the kind of relationship, the situation, and the purpose of communication, individuals may be more or less explicit and direct. In close relationships, communication shorthand is often used, which makes communication opaque to outsiders, but perfectly clear to the parties involved. With strangers, the same people may choose low-context communication. LOW-CONTEXT COMMUNICATION “say what you mean, mean what you say” HIGH-CONTEXT COMMUNICATION “reading between the lines” Is straightforward and logical Relies on nonverbal communication such as gestures, sighs, and silences Mostly words Customs and ideas provide background information Less formal Much remains unsaid, but can be inferred Equal status to all involved in a conversation Interactions may be guided by status and position Main goal is to give and get information Words used can be taken literally Information is accessible (LeBaron, 2003) BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 14 Unconditional Positive Regard Unconditional Positive Regard (UPR), as discussed in Module 2 – Professionalism, should also be employed as a strategy for developing and providing the child and family you support with culturally competent services. UPR serves as the cornerstone for the development of a respectful relationship with the child and family. Assumptions and generalizations about unfamiliar groups are sure to be damaging to the relationship between you and the family that you support. As a BHP, you can work to avoid these issues by resisting the urge to make generalizations and instead make an effort to learn more about the child and family.

Unconditional Positive Regard Positive Perception Respect Worth Free of Judgment Empathy Support Acceptance BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 15 From Father to Father By Salvador Hernandez I don’t consider being the father of children with special needs as a problem, but more as a challenge that God “the all powerful” puts before us, since we do not choose it. This is my personal story. My three children were born with special needs. Ronald, my first born, who is six years old, is the one who has required and has continued to require a lot of assistance for his development. Even now, we still have not received a complete diagnosis of his medical condition. The closest information that we have received is that he has Hajdu-Cheney Syndrome, a genetic condition that affects the growth and development of his bones as well as other aspects of his life. As immigrants to this country, it has not been easy to address the challenge of my son’s special needs. Language barriers have not been the only issues that we’ve confronted, but also I have experienced discrimination from the different institutions and organizations that I have visited. In terms of language, simply because I have been unable to express myself or have the adequate English vocabulary to explain my son’s condition, this was a problem when we needed to request any services. I was not always offered an interpreter and I was not aware that I have the legal right to be provided an interpreter at no cost to me. If you add cultural factors to the language issue, the situation becomes more complex, when as a newcomer parent you have to understand the ways that professionals act in a given situation. For example, in my son’s situation, it seemed to me that the professionals reacted in a more detached and impersonal way. Here, the professionals seem used to treating every case or family situation the same way, and give news that can be very upsetting to a family as if it were nothing of importance. They also seem to expect that children will obtain milestones and independence quickly. In my culture, the contrary is true. The norm is to treat families with more warmth and understanding and allow children to develop at a slower pace. We have tried to rise above the issues of language and culture, because we understand that to dwell on them is not the way to get our children’s needs met. This perspective has helped us to depend less on interpreters and manage our own language needs as much as possible. Additionally, from a cultural perspective, we have learned to assist our family members and ourselves (as parents) to be less overprotective of our son, preferring to support his development and present him with challenges so that he can be the best he can be. BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 16 Having overcome these barriers and accepting our children’s conditions has allowed us to participate in a support group for parents of children with special needs. We have also been able to obtain federal and state benefits for our children. Being able to navigate the system, respond to emergency situations or simply answering questions like – Why is your child like that? Or, Papi, why don’t I have fingernails – have been the links in the chain of strength, knowledge and courage to fight for our children. I have learned to advocate for my children the same way that I support other family members that are going through the same situation. The birth of a child with special needs can make parents feel that the world is caving in, but the support of other families helps you to learn that you are able to face adversities. This has enabled me to support my other two children, three-year-old Frank and two-year- old Karina, both of whom have language delays. With all of the experience that we have gained, we have been able to identify sources of evaluation and support to assist our children in their development. My son Frank is already obtained age appropriate language skills and my daughter is receiving speech therapy. In order to move forward, we have experienced sad, painful, anguished, fearful moments. As a result, you realize that you cannot do everything on your own. My wife had to quit her job and I had to miss work many times to take my son to the doctor’s or to the hospital for emergencies. Thank God, I have been able to keep my job. I have learned that help is available, but you have to look for it. Some of the services and supports that I have received include the following: • Moral support - through a support group • Economic support through SSI • Educational support through programs such as early intervention, Head Start, etc. • Technical assistance through supports such as medical, rehabilitative, therapeutic, and psychological services • Health services through health insurance • Housing through housing programs, and • Training through programs for parents. All of these services and information helped us to not only find support and help at very difficult times, but also opened new roads so that we could continue to grow and be strengthened to face our challenge. Reprinted from: National Center for Cultural Competence Georgetown University Center for Child & Human Development University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 17 Family Dynamics Family is an institution, a social system, and a group (Eshelman & Bulcroft, 2000). As an institution, it is a well-established structure that cares for and prepares children to be productive members of society. External and internal rules, principles, and responsibilities govern family functioning. As a social system, it is comprised of interdependent individuals who assume various roles and relationships. As a group, each member has a unique style and connection to the other members, which creates a unique group (family) identity and styles of interacting. According to Bidwell and Vander Mey (1999), Family refers to a collection of people, related to each other by marriage, ancestry, adoption, or affinity, who have a commitment to each other and a unique identity with each other. This collection forms an economic unit. The adults in the collection have varying degrees of responsibility for younger members that might be a part of the collection. This definition expands on the traditional, mid-century concept of a family consisting of a man, a woman, and their biological child(ren), to encompass the many ways individuals come together to care for children and each other. Family has an enduring influence on our lives. Family can be a source of pride, frustration, strength, heartache, disappointment, and support. This wide range of emotions associated with family can serve to strengthen and/or break down the bonds between members. As we discussed earlier, each family unit develops a unique culture that dictates how the family functions and relates to the world around them. Sociologists have identified phases of family development, sometimes referred to as the “family life cycle.” Stage theory models attempt to describe the predictable patterns that families experience. These phases are marked by the developmental milestones in the children, and the subsequent changes in the responsibilities and priorities for their caregivers. Evelyn Duvall created a basic 8-stage theory for family development. This model provides a framework for understanding the general stages through which families proceed. Each stage brings new opportunities and challenges. Keep in mind that every family is unique and this model does not address the wide array of contextual issues, such as ethnicity, family composition, or life events that can affect these stages. BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 18 • No children • New commitment • Couple implies 2 adults Newly Established Couples • Couples take on new role = parents • Oldest child is birth - 2.5 years Childbearing and Childrearing • Role of parent(s) change as children changeFamilies with toddlers/preschoolers • Oldest child is in school • Parent role changes Families with children of school age • Children are able to meet more of their needs independently • Parents may be thinking about what happens next Families with teenagers • Parents help child to become more independent • Children make decisions about what to do after leaving Launching of young adult children • This stage is defined by an empty nest • Possibly begin caring for their own aging parents. • Ends at the start of parents' retirement Midlife couples entering retirement • Stage begins when parents retire and ends with their deaths • Transitioning to and navigating role as a Grandparent Late life couples with grandchildren Family Development 8-stage Model (Duvall, 1985) BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 19 While similarities may exist among families and the phases that they progress through over time, a variety of factors affect the process of family development. Life events such as re-marriage, death, unplanned pregnancy, raising grandchildren, divorce, separation, and relocation are some of the things that can influence how a family progresses through these stages of development. Recently developed models of the family life cycle have viewed the stages as more varied and fluid, accounting for current social influences and norms. The families that you serve may come up against a different set of challenges during the process of family development. These children, and sometimes their family members, have diagnoses that affect their development and therefore may interrupt, delay, or prolong these typical stages. Families of children with these developmental delays or mental health diagnoses may stay in certain phases of family development for extended periods of time, and they may never reach other phases. Your work as a BHP will be enhanced by an acknowledgment that family development is not a ‘one size fits all’ prospect. It is also important to remember that the families that you work with are likely aware that their family unit is not progressing through these stages in the order or manner that they thought they might when they first started their family. The emotions associated with this process can be deeply felt and difficult to come to terms with. BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 20 Welcome to Holland By Emily Perl Kingsley I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It's like this... When you're going to have a baby, it's like planning a fabulous vacation trip - to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It's all very exciting. After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The stewardess comes in and says, \"Welcome to Holland.\" \"Holland?!?\" you say. \"What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life, I've dreamed of going to Italy.\" But there's been a change in the flight plan. They've landed in Holland and there you must stay. The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine, and disease. It's just a different place. So, you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would never have met. It's just a different place. It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy. But after you've been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around... and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills... and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts. But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And for the rest of your life, you will say \"Yes, that's where I was supposed to go. That's what I had planned.\" And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away... because the loss of that dream is a very, very significant loss. But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things... about Holland. BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 21 Supporting Healthy Families The families that you work with face challenges that go beyond the scope of what ‘typical’ families may experience. The table below provides an outline of some of these challenges, as well as strategies for responding to these challenges. Challenges Strategies GRIEVING – Families that have a child with a disability often go through a grieving process. There are distinct stages of grief, and for these families, these stages may reoccur. Families are grieving for the loss of dreams and hopes that they had for their child. As milestones they dreamt of come and go, this grief remains a constant. Maintaining an attitude of Unconditional Positive Regard and a willingness to understand the family’s experience can help with a family’s grieving process. Concerns about family function should be brought to the supervisor. CHRONIC STRESS – All parents and families have stress, regardless of their situation. Chronic stress occurs when a person experiences constant demands and pressure for extended periods of time without adequate relief, which can cause fatigue, illness and feelings of hopelessness. Day-to-day tasks become overwhelming because the families have so much more to think about and consider. As a BHP, you can teach and model stress management techniques that fit within the scope of the child’s ITP. Focusing on the strengths and accomplishments of the family will serve to keep the atmosphere positive and give the family a much- needed boost in their confidence. ADULT DISABILITIES – Parents and family members may have their own disabilities that can affect their ability to learn new skills necessary for progress. These disabilities can take the form of mental illness and chronic illness among other things. Unconditional Positive Regard is the best asset when dealing with adult disabilities within the families that you serve. Model positive behavior management techniques and identify further resources for the family to access. POVERTY – Families may have difficulty managing full-time employment and attending to the needs of their child. Repeatedly being called away from their employment to attend to the needs of their child can force caregivers into difficult decisions that may result in not being able to keep their jobs. This challenge can lead to a lack of funds and living at or near the poverty level. You should speak with your supervisor if poverty is affecting the family’s ability to meet the basic needs of their child(ren). Resources such as Community Case Management may help the family access basic needs. Continued on next page BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 22 Challenges Strategies LACK OF RESOURCES, SOCIALIZATION, AND RECREATION – Families often feel alone and as though there are few who truly understand their situation. They may also not be aware of supports within their community and this challenge can lead to feelings of isolation. You can brainstorm with the child and family about activities that they would like to involve themselves in. Unmet needs should be brought to the attention of your supervisor. SUBSTANCE ABUSE – Caregivers may struggle with addiction; misusing or abusing drugs or alcohol, possibly as a means to cope with other stressors. When the use of a substance causes distress or impairment, it becomes problematic. Any concerns that the young person, their caregiver, or another household member is abusing alcohol or drugs (legal or illegal) should be brought to the attention of your supervisor immediately. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE – “Domestic violence is a pattern of assaultive and coercive behaviors that adults or adolescents use against their current or former intimate partners” (Missouri Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, 2015). As with substance abuse, domestic violence is complex and beyond your scope of practice as a BHP. Any concerns that the child is living in a home where domestic violence is occurring should be brought to the attention of your supervisor. All BHPs are Mandated Reporters and Unconditional Positive Regard does not mean overlooking circumstances that may jeopardize the child’s safety or well-being. Siblings Siblings of children with developmental disabilities have a unique experience within both the culture and dynamics of their families. For many, the experience is a positive, enriching one that teaches them to accept other people as they are. Some siblings become deeply involved in helping parents care for the child with a disability. It is not uncommon for siblings to become ardent protectors and supporters of their brother or sister with special needs or to experience feelings of great joy in watching him or her achieve even the smallest gain in learning or development. In contrast, siblings can also experience feelings of bitterness and resentment toward their parents or the brother or sister with a disability. They may feel jealous, neglected, or rejected as they watch disproportionate amounts of their parents’ energy, attention, money, and psychological support flow to the child with special needs. Most siblings will swing back and forth between positive and negative emotions. BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 23 Age can make a difference. The reaction and adjustment of siblings to a brother or sister with a disability may also vary depending upon their ages and developmental levels. The younger the typically developing sibling is, the more difficult it may be for him or her to understand the situation and to interpret events realistically. Younger children may be confused about the nature of the disability, including what caused it. They may feel that they are to blame or may worry about “catching” the disability. As siblings mature, their understanding of disabilities matures as well, but new concerns may emerge. They may worry about the future of their brother or sister, about how their peers will react to their sibling, or about whether or not they can pass the disability along to their own children. Another important consideration is that siblings may be concerned with whether or not they will have to care for their sibling when their parents are no longer able to do so. These decisions can be overwhelming for siblings and may require them to think about scenarios that often outweigh their emotional maturity. What Kids Can Understand Preschoolers, before age 5 Children of this age, unable to adequately express their feelings verbally, are likely to express them through behavior. They are not able to understand the special needs of their sibling, but they will start to notice differences. Elementary school children At this age, children become acutely aware of differences. They can understand explanations in proper terms. They might worry that the disability is contagious or if something is wrong with them, too. They may feel guilty for having negative thoughts or feelings about the sibling. They may also feel guilty for not having a disability. Some siblings become overly helpful and well-behaved, and others become non-compliant to get attention. As in all sibling relationships, they experience conflicting feelings. Adolescents Teenagers are capable of understanding more in-depth explanations of the disability, and they may ask detailed and searching questions. They may wonder about how their social life is affected and where they fit in. Since conformity with the group is important, they may feel embarrassed BHP Module 4 - Cultural Competency and Family Dynamics 24 about having a sibling who is different. Some adolescents may resent responsibility and worry about their sibling’s future as well as their own. Note: From the Maine Parent Federation. Reprinted with permission. Sibling involvement in a treatment plan will vary depending on the level and type of service the child is receiving. Section 28 services concentrate on specific goals that have been laid out for the child, while Section 65 allows for goals to be written that specifically target family goals and objectives. If a child has goals that can be addressed within the context of sibling relationships (turn- taking, greeting, reciprocal conversation), these goals should be considered by the Treatment Team. For example, taking the opportunity to involve the siblings with board games can address the goals of the child that you are working with while also fostering a deeper relationship between siblings. HCT services may involve specific goals for the family as a unit and the specific relationships that exist within that unit. For example, a child may be given guidance regarding interaction and communication with the sibling who has a developmental disability. For more information on what siblings of children with special needs may experience please visit: http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/specneed.htm Here, you will find warning signs as well as resources that parents can be given when they express frustration or worry about the dynamic between siblings in the house. Conclusion Providing culturally competent services with awareness and respect for the dynamics of the families that you support is critical for progress on all fronts. Do not be afraid to ask questions about these concepts. Take advantage of the expertise of your supervisor when attempting to navigate situations that have the potential for value conflicts.
