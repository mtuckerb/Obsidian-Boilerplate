Many things could result in a change in your family’s circumstances since the court issued the order. Examples include a change in financial circumstances . . .. • You will need the following forms for a Motion to Modify: Family and Probate Matter Summary Sheet (FM-002); Social Security Number Confidential Disclosure Form (CR-CV-FM-PC-200); Motion to Modify (FM-062); Acknowledgment of Service (two copies) (CV-036); and Child Support Affidavit (if applicable) (FM-050).

But when that's not possible, you'll need to have a judge decide for you. When you file a motion or petition to decrease alimony, you'll usually have to submit documents that detail your financial information, including income (if any), expenses, assets, and debts. Your ex will have to do the same along with the response to your request. You can often find links to the documents you need to file on your local court's website. Alimony doesn't always change just because your income changes. How to Prove You're Entitled to Reduced Alimony It's important to know that alimony doesn't always change just because your income changes. Typically, you won't be able to get a reduction in your current spousal support payments unless you can prove that you or your ex has experienced a substantial change in circumstances, such as: you've involuntarily lost a job or had a significant reduction in income you have a new illness or disability that prevents you from working your ex has remarried or is cohabiting with a new partner who's providing financial support or contributing to paying expenses your ex's income has increased significantly, or your ex has inherited a significant amount of money or property that can provide income. In some states, the judge may dismiss your request if your initial paperwork doesn't show that you've met the changed-circumstances requirement. And usually, the change in circumstances must be ongoing as well as significant. That means, for instance, that the judge might not grant you a reduction in spousal maintenance right after you've lost your job, unless you can show that you've tried to get other work but haven't been successful. After you've filed the motion and initial financial statements, you and your ex will generally go through the process known as \"discovery,\" meaning that each of you will be able to ask the other to produce any additional documention to support or oppose the modification request. Then the judge will conduct a hearing to review all of your evidence and make a decision. • In a Divorce.net discussion of Maine law, the following was stated: • Judges in Maine can award general, transitional, reimbursement, nominal, or interim support. (Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, § 951-A (1).) General support is the least common type of spousal support because courts reserve it for marriages lasting more than 10 years. General support may last only as long as half the length of the marriage. For example, if your marriage lasted 10 years, the judge can only award general support for 5 years. General support is only appropriate if a lower-earning or unemployed spouse is unable to become financially independent due to age or health issues. • Spousal support in Maine is gender-neutral, meaning that either spouse can request it if the spouse can demonstrate a need for help and that the paying spouse can afford to pay. Once the court establishes a need for support, the judge will evaluate the following factors to determine the type, duration, and amount of support: the length of the marriage each spouse's ability to pay, age, employment history, and employment potential both spouse's income history and income potential each spouse's education and training, provisions for retirement, and health insurance benefits the tax consequences of the divorce property division, including the sale of the marital home each spouse's contributions as a homemaker during the marriage whether either spouse contributed to the other's education or earning potential during the marriage whether either spouse committed economic misconduct that diminished marital assets the supported spouse's ability to become self-supporting within a reasonable period whether actual or potential income from marital and nonmarital property received in the divorce, or a child support award, impacts the supported spouse's need for support, and any other factor the court considers appropriate. (Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, § 951-5 (A-Q).) In Maine, there's no specific formula that judges to use to calculate alimony. Judges will weigh each of the above factors equally and determine the proper type, duration, and amount of the support order. Couples who would like to control the specifics of their support award can negotiate the terms of the order and, if it's fair to both spouses, the judge will approve it. Failure to pay spousal support can result in the court charging you with contempt, which means the judge can order you to pay fines or attorney fees, place a lien on your property or bank account, or sentence you to serve a jail sentence. Spousal Support Payments Maine law requires judges to include the method of payment (and the duration) in every support order. Judges will typically require installment payments and include an income withholding order with the support order. Income withholding means that the court requires the paying spouse's employer to deduct support payments directly from the employee's paycheck and send it to the spousal support agency within the court. (Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, § 951-3). In some cases, a lump-sum payment is appropriate for spousal support. For example, if the paying spouse is self-employed and doesn't receive a regular paycheck, the court may award a lump-sum payment of support from the paying spouse's share of marital assets. (Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, § 954). Failure to pay spousal support can result in the court charging you with contempt, which means the judge can order you to pay fines or attorney fees, place a lien on your property or bank account, or sentence you to serve a jail sentence. Modify Your Support Order If you believe there has been a change in circumstances that makes your current support order outdated, you can ask the court to review it. The court may modify your support order \"as justice requires.\" Common reasons for modification may include a change in income of either spouse or health changes. The court will terminate support if either spouse dies, or if the supported spouse remarries or cohabitates with another person in a mutually supportive relationship for at least 12 consecutive months. (Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, § 951-8, 12). LEARNINGS: • According to Claude, when considering modification requests, Maine courts evaluate: • Obligor’s current ability to pay • the substantial change in financial circumstances • whether the change was reasonably foreseeable • the needs of the recipient spouse • Claude states that an obligor receiving TANF would likely have a strong case for at least a temporary modification due to financial hardship, although this requires court approval. • ANALYSIS: • CONCLUSIONS: • The Final Order on pages 9-10 states that; “In all other respects, spousal support is modifiable according to Maine law.” •","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
