TIMER SHORT MODE For service, the following set time can be shortened by bridging JPG and JPS on the electronic control P.C. board. (Refer to 9-7.) Set time: 3 minutes → 3 seconds (It takes 3 minutes for the compressor to start operation. However, the starting time is shortened by bridging JPG and JPS.) 7-2. HOW TO SET REMOTE CONTROLLER EXCLUSIVELY FOR A PARTICULAR INDOOR UNIT A maximum of 4 indoor units with wireless remote controllers can be used in a room. To operate the indoor units individually with each remote controller, assign a number to each remote controller according to the number of the indoor unit. This setting can be set only when all the following conditions are met: • The remote controller is powered OFF. • Weekly timer is not set. • Weekly timer is not being edited. (1) Hold down button on the remote controller for 2 seconds to enter the pairing mode. (2) Press button again and assign a number to each remote controller. Each press of button advances the number in the following order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4. (3) Press button to complete the pairing setting. After you turn the breaker ON, the remote controller that first sends a signal to an indoor unit will be regarded as the remote controller for the indoor unit. Once they are set, the indoor unit will only receive the signal from the assigned remote controller afterwards. 7-3. SETTING THE INSTALLATION POSITION Be sure to set the remote controller according to the installed position of the indoor unit. Installation position: Left: Distance to objects (wall, cabinet, etc.) is less than 50 cm to the left Center: Distance to objects (wall, cabinet, etc.) is more than 50 cm to the left and right Right: Distance to objects (wall, cabinet, etc.) is less than 50 cm to the right The installation position can be set only when all the following conditions are met: • The remote controller is powered OFF. • Weekly timer is not set. • Weekly timer is not being edited. (1) Hold down button on the remote controller for 2 seconds to enter the position setting mode. (2) Select the target installation position by pressing button. (Each press of the button displays the positions in order: center → right → left.) (3) Press button to complete the position setting.

AUTO RESTART FUNCTION When the indoor unit is controlled with the remote controller, the operation mode, the set temperature, and the fan speed are memorized by the indoor electronic control P.C. board. “AUTO RESTART FUNCTION” automatically starts operation in the same mode just before the shutoff of the main power. Operation If the main power has been cut, the operation settings remain. After the power is restored, the unit restarts automatically according to the memory. (However, it takes at least 3 minutes for the compressor to start running.) How to disable “AUTO RESTART FUNCTION” Turn off the main power for the unit. Cut the jumper wire to JR77 on the indoor electronic control P.C. board. (Refer to 9-7.) NOTE: • The operation settings are memorized when 10 seconds have passed after the indoor unit was operated with the remote controller. • If main power is turned OFF or a power failure occurs while AUTO START/STOP timer is active, the timer setting is can- celled. • If the unit has been off with the remote controller before power failure, the auto restart function does not work as the power button of the remote controller is OFF. • To prevent breaker OFF due to the rush of starting current, systematize other home appliance not to turn ON at the same time. • When some air conditioners are connected to the same supply system, if they are operated before power failure, the start- ing current of all the compressors may flow simultaneously at restart. Therefore, the special counter-measures are required to prevent the main voltage-drop or the rush of the starting current by adding to the system that allows the units to start one by one.

Cold air prevention control When the compressor is not operating or is starting, and the temperature of indoor heat exchanger and/or the room tem- perature is low or when defrosting is being done, the indoor fan will stop or rotate in Very Low speed. 2. High pressure protection The compressor operational frequency is controlled by the temperature of the indoor heat exchanger to prevent the con- densing pressure from increasing excessively. When the temperature of indoor heat exchanger becomes too high, the high pressure protection works. The indoor fan operates following the cold air prevention control. This mode continues until the temperature of indoor heat exchanger falls. 3. Defrosting Defrosting starts when the temperature of outdoor heat exchanger becomes too low. The compressor stops once, the indoor/outdoor fans stop, the 4-way valve reverses, and the compressor re-starts. This mode continues until the temperature of outdoor heat exchanger rises or the fixed time passes. 8-5.
