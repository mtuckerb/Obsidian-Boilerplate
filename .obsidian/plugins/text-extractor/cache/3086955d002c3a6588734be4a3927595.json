(2019) Chapter 11.pdf","text":"CHAPTER ONE Overview of the #MeToo Movement “Me too.” By posting these two words on social media, millions of women estab- lished a community of survivors and launched a social change movement to end sexual harassment and assault. Activist Tarana Burke ﬁrst recognized the power of the words a decade earlier, when she used them to offer solace, support, and solidarity to a young girl who entrusted her with a report of sexual abuse. The words gained new relevance in October 2017, when doz- ens of female celebrities came forward to accuse Hollywood producer Har- vey Weinstein of sexual misconduct. In the wake of the Weinstein scandal, actress Alyssa Milano invited people who had experienced sexual harass- ment or assault to use the words to demonstrate the pervasiveness of the problem. Her request received an overwhelming response, as women around the world shared their stories on social media using the hashtag #MeToo. “A basic concept of #MeToo is the power of numbers across time: the difference between a single victim, whose lone account might not be believed, and the choruses of ‘me too’ that make each individual’s account that much more believable,” wrote Jeannie Suk Gersen in the New Yorker. “When it comes down to it, #MeToo itself constitutes an evidentiary claim of sorts: what you say happened to you happened to me, too, and so it is more likely that we are both telling the truth” (Gersen 2018). Research conﬁrmed the anecdotal evidence offered by the #MeToo social media campaign. A 2018 survey by the nonproﬁt organization Stop Street Harassment found that 81 percent of women in the United States had expe- rienced some form of sexual harassment, ranging from whistles and catcalls to leering, stalking, groping, and sexual assault. More than half of women reported being touched in a sexual manner without their permission, while COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 2 The #MeToo Movement 27 percent reported being victims of sexual assault. Two-thirds of women experienced sexual harassment in public spaces, and 38 percent experi- enced it in the workplace. Only 10 percent of women reported the harass- ment to an authority ﬁgure, while less than 1 percent confronted the perpetrator. Instead, most women responded to sexual harassment by mak- ing changes in their own lives and daily routines, such as quitting a job, stopping an activity, switching schools, or moving to a new residence (Chatterjeee 2018). Misogyny and Feminism Some analysts view sexual harassment as a manifestation of systemic misogyny in American society. They contend that misogyny—characterized by contempt, hostility, denigration, objectiﬁcation, and violence aimed at women—served as an organizing principle throughout U.S. history and is still reﬂected in a patriarchal system of male dominance and female subordi- nation in politics, business, and popular culture. As evidence of the histori- cal devaluation of women in the United States, they point to the fact that only 52 women have served in the U.S. Senate during its ﬁrst 230 years in existence. In addition, they note that working women today earn an average of 80 cents for every dollar paid to men, and that female executives lead less than 5 percent of Fortune 500 companies. According to management consultant Michelle Kim, this gender-based power structure—combined with ingrained attitudes of entitlement and privilege among men—creates an environment where gender discrimina- tion and sexual harassment can thrive. “Our entire society is built on sys- tems of patriarchy, toxic masculinity, and rape culture,” she wrote. “The ways in which we shame, blame, and doubt survivors of sexual violence (‘what were you wearing?’‘are you sure that’s what happened?’‘were you drunk?’), how our legal systems are built to center the needs of perpetrators, and how early education around sexual violence focuses on reactionary cau- tion (‘buy your own drink,’‘don’twalkalone at night,’‘cover your skin’) … these are all examples of how we subconsciously and consciously perpetuate the cycle of gender-based violence in our society” (Kim 2017). Feminism arose to counteract the forces of misogyny in American culture. Historians have identiﬁed several key feminist movements or waves—includ- ing the women’s suffrage movement of the nineteenth and early twentieth cen- turies and the women’s liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s—that made signiﬁcant strides toward attaining political and social equality for American women. Women gained voting rights with the 1920 passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, for instance, and they achieved reproductive COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC freedom through a series of landmark Supreme Court cases. The inclusion of “sex” as a protected category in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimi- nation on the basis of gender. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commis- sion (EEOC) used Title VII of the Civil Rights Act as the basis of its 1980 rules prohibiting sexual harassment in the workplace. Attorney Anita Hill helped launch another wave of feminist activism in 1991 with her appearance at the conﬁrmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. In televised testimony that riveted the nation, Hill claimed that Thomas had subjected her to a pattern of inappropriate remarks and offensive conduct when she worked for him a decade earlier. Thomas emphatically denied Hill’s accusations, calling them politically motivated. Hill’s shocking allegations raised public awareness of workplace sexual harass- ment and empowered more women to come forward, resulting in a record number of complaints ﬁled with the EEOC. The skeptical interrogation she endured from members of the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee, mean- while, generated outrage and resentment among many women. Determined to change the atmosphere in politics, a record number of women ran for ofﬁce in 1992, which became known as the “Year of the Woman.” Some observers place the #MeToo movement within this broader context of American feminism and view it as another historic milestone in the ﬁght for women’srights. “To the extent that women’s bodies are still treated as pub- lic property by men, whether that means groping us or deciding what we can do with our uteruses, women do not have civic equality,” Laura Kipnis wrote in the Guardian. “To miss that point is to miss the political importance and the political lineage of #MeToo: the latest step in a centuries long political struggle for women to simply control our own bodies” (Kipnis 2018). A key factor differentiating the #MeToo movement from its predecessors— and amplifying its impact—is activists’ extensive use of social media tools. Since Milano’stweet ﬁrst popularized the #MeToo hashtag on Twitter, sup- porters have used online platforms to share information, plan and organize protest actions, propagate political messages, and debate feminist ideas. Some activists have also used social media to expose sexual harassment by individ- uals and within institutions. Software engineer Susan Fowler, for instance, recounted her work experience at Uber in a viral blog post that revealed a per- vasive culture of sexual harassment in the technology industry. Fowler’s post also prompted an internal investigation that ultimately led to the resignation of Uber’sfounder. “It has given a voice to many, like myself, who otherwise wouldn’t have had a platform,” Fowler said of social media. “#MeToo is a per- fect example.… It made the rest of the world ﬁnally understand the true extent of inappropriate behavior against women, and the damage it causes” (Hook 2017). Overview of the #MeToo Movement 3 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 4 The #MeToo Movement #MeToo and Women’s Empowerment Many social commentators have argued that the 2016 presidential cam- paign served as a precipitating factor in the development of the #MeToo movement. The campaign featured the ﬁrst female presidential nominee from a major political party, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Her candidacy brought issues of gender equality and sexism to the forefront of American politics. Critics accused her opponent, Republican Donald Trump, of mak- ing misogynistic remarks throughout his campaign. Trump claimed that a female journalist questioned him aggressively because she was menstruat- ing, for instance, and he implied that a female political rival was not attrac- tive enough to hold ofﬁce. Shortly before the November election, a recording surfaced in which Trump seemingly boasted about taking advan- tage of his celebrity to commit sexual assault. Several women subsequently came forward to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct, but his supporters either did not believe the allegations or felt they did not disqualify him from becoming president. When voters went to the polls, many feminists harbored strong hopes that the United States would elect its ﬁrst female president. They responded to Trump’s electoral victory with grief and outrage. Critics expressed con- cern that his leadership on the world stage would normalize misogyny and reverse gains toward women’s equality. In January 2017, one day after Trump’s inauguration, more than 3 million people in 400 cities and towns across the United States expressed their determination to stand up for wom- en’s rights by participating in the Women’s March. “A lot of people started off this year feeling a sense of hopelessness, because we had a president in our ofﬁce who was self-admitted to be a sexual predator,” #MeToo founder Tarana Burke acknowledged. “As a woman, as an American citizen, that is disheartening to know that the person who is the leader of your country thinks like that and operates like that.… In ways I think that it has embold- ened women and empowered us to step up and amplify our voices even louder” (Snyder and Lopez 2017). The sense of empowerment generated by the Women’s March, coupled with the public debate over Trump’s alleged sexual misconduct, prompted several women to come forward with accusations against other men in posi- tions of power in early 2017. Fowler’s blog post appeared in February, for instance, and Fox News ﬁred host Bill O’Reilly in April after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. The turning point in breaking the silence came in October of that year, however, when New York Times investigative journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey published an article detailing allegations of sexual misconduct—ranging from COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC unwelcome advances to rape—against Weinstein spanning his 30-year career as one of the most successful producers in Hollywood. His accusers eventually included dozens of ﬁlm stars, such as Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Pal- trow, Angelina Jolie, Uma Thurman, Lupita Nyong’o, and Salma Hayek. The Weinstein scandal opened the ﬂoodgates of #MeToo disclosures. After Milano introduced the hashtag on Twitter, it appeared in 2.3 million tweets by users in 85 different countries within a matter of weeks (Fox and Diehm 2017). Over the next few months, more than 200 prominent men in various ﬁelds faced allegations of sexual misconduct. In the atmos- phere of reduced tolerance created by the #MeToo campaign, many of the accused men suddenly found their reputations ruined and their careers ended. “There is a kind of unmasking going on,” said Robin Lakoff, a pro- fessor at the University of California at Berkeley. “A lot of these are people who are venerated, people who were taken very seriously” (Hook 2017). Seeking to sustain the momentum, #MeToo activists launched Time’sUp, a series of initiatives aimed at helping working women ﬁght sexual harass- ment and lobbying for legislative changes to hold perpetrators accountable. Criticism and Backlash During the last few months of 2017, every day seemed to bring new media reports about powerful men being accused of sexual misconduct. The ﬂurry of allegations and repercussions raised concerns about potential negative effects of the #MeToo reckoning. Some critics characterized #MeToo activists as dan- gerous extremists who rushed to judgment and denied due process in their zeal to destroy men. “They believe they are ﬁghting an insidious, ubiquitous evil—the patriarchy—just as the extreme anti-Communists in the 1950s believed that commies were everywhere and so foul they didn’tdeserve a presumption of innocence, or simple human decency,” columnist Andrew Sullivan argued. “They demand public confessions of the guilty and public support for their cause … or they will cast suspicion on you as well” (Sullivan 2018). Other critics worried that #MeToo activists could harm the feminist cause by publicizing unsubstantiated allegations. Some of the #MeToo backlash focused on the movement’s impact on relationships between men and women, whether professional relationships in the workplace or personal relationships on the dating scene. Critics con- tended that the avalanche of high-proﬁle allegations created an atmosphere of fear, mistrust, and confusion, as men struggled to understand the new standards of appropriate behavior toward women. They warned that men’s feelings of discomfort could result in fewer job opportunities for women. “Many men will absorb the lessons of late 2017 to be not about the threat Overview of the #MeToo Movement 5 COPYRIGHT 2019 ABC-CLIO, LLC 6 The #MeToo Movement they’ve posed to women but about the threat that women pose to them,” journalist Rebecca Traister stated. “So there will be more—perhaps uncon- scious—hesitancy about hiring women, less eagerness to invite them to lunch, or send them on work trips with men; men will be warier of mentor- ing women” (Traister 2017). Some critics charged that the #MeToo disclosures often failed to differen- tiate between conduct that merely made women feel uncomfortable—such as unwelcome ﬂirtation—and sexual violence. They argued that zero toler- ance policies, which required perpetrators to be punished regardless of the level of offense, portrayed women as helpless victims who were incapable of protecting their own interests. “Why would you need such stringent rules unless you view women as essentially weak creatures who can’t stand up for themselves?” journalist Heather Wilhelm wrote. “It’s strangely Victorian. It’s also pretty darn anti-feminist, as far as I can see. Strangely, modern femi- nism seems to have shifted our cultural focus from supposed ‘empower- ment’ and ‘choice’ to treating people like not-so-resourceful children” (Wilhelm 2018). #MeToo supporters, on the other hand, argue that the movement has brought much-needed public attention to the pervasiveness of sexual harass- ment and assault. They view it as a long-overdue reckoning that shed light on forms of degradation and abuse that women had always silently endured in order to keep their jobs, or secretly warned each other about through “whis- per networks,” or reluctantly altered their lives to avoid. They marvel at the fact that two words empowered women around the world to join together and speak out against sexism, misogyny, and discrimination. “We should not mourn the end of the creative lives of the men being outed as predators; we should contemplate the creative contributions we never had, will never know, because their creators were crushed or shut out,” said writer Rebecca Solnit. “The losses due to misogyny and racism have been normalized forever. The task has been to de-normalize them and break the silence they impose. To make a society in which everyone’s story gets told” (Solnit 2017).
