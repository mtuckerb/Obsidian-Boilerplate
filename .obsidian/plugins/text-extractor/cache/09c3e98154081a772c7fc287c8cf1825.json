The present article argues that the foreseeable receding of French internationally can be explained by the correlation between language and nationalism. The article is divided into four parts. The first one describes the evolution of ex-colonial sub- jects’ attitudes towards the ex-colonial languages. The second part shows how English has adapted to new postcolonial contexts by liberating itself from its national origin and imperial past, while French has not. The third part examines French linguistic culture which is grounded in linguistic purism, assimilation and the refusal to accept non-white language users. The use of notions such as ‘littéra- ture francophone’ is an expression of the exclusive nature of this ideology which makes French a ‘closed’ language. The fourth and final part presents some recent (nationalist) reactions towards ex-colonial languages in former colonies. Résumé Dans le système linguistique mondial qui se dessine, la rivalité entre l’anglais et le français semble tourner à l’avantage du premier. Cet article cherche à montrer que le recul du français dans le monde pourrait s’expliquer par le maintien du lien entre langue et appartenance nationale. L’article comprend quatre parties. La première porte sur l’évolution des attitudes chez les anciens colonisés envers les ex-langues coloniales. La deuxième montre comment l’anglais a réussi à s’adapter aux nouvelles conditions nées de la décolonisation en s’affranchissant de son origine nationale et son passé impérialiste, mais pas le français. La troisième partie analyse la culture linguis- tique française qui s’enracine dans le purisme, l’assimilationnisme et le refus des usagers non-blancs. L’utilisation de concepts comme la ‘littérature francophone’ exprime la nature exclusive de cette idéologie qui fait du français une langue ‘fermée’. La quatrième et dernière partie présente quelques réactions (nationalistes) contre les ex-langues coloniales dans les anciens pays colonisés. Introduction Competition between languages is not new and it is probably as old as lan- guage itself. Today, the phenomenon is acute as a result of developments following the Second World War. One such development is decolonization which led to a dramatic increase in the number of independent nations. 253IJFS 12 (2&3) pp. 253–269 © Intellect Ltd 2009 Keywords assimilation de-ethnicization language attitudes language competition linguistic culture nationalism IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 253 The membership of the United Nations more than tripled between the time it started life with 51 founding members in 1945 and 192 members in early 2000. With around seven thousand languages (Gordon 2005: 16) scattered over less than two hundred national communities in the world opportunities for language competition and conflict have increased. Linguistic rivalry is both internal and external to these new national enti- ties. Language policies implemented by their governments have tended to favour the expansion of one language – or, in rare cases, a small group of languages – at the expense of others. External linguistic struggles often concern the rivalry between former colonial languages, especially English and French – competition between these two ex-colonial languages heightened in the twentieth century as English continued to spread at the expense of French because of the rising influence of the United States and American capitalism. This article concentrates on the latter type of com- petition. The great changes that have affected the planet recently could modify the global language system. Within this new world linguistic order, several observers have pointed to the dangers that French faces in the world (Chaudenson 2003; Graddol 1997; Roy 2008). Some tend to blame the French central authority’s failure to provide the necessary means for maintaining the dominant position of the French language. A recent claim made by Jean-Louis Roy reads: ‘[La France] n’a pas réussi à créer un espace culturel commun spécifique, des systèmes forts de circulation pour les créateurs et leurs œuvres, des événements culturels à large retentisse- ment’ (Roy 2008: 250). This line of reasoning remains consistent with mainstream French linguistic ideology (culture) which considers language as ‘an affair of the state’ (Parker 2000: 180; Safran 1999: 40). This study proposes a different view. It argues that the foreseeable receding of French internationally can also be explained by the close ties that exist between the French language and national origin. Different fortunes after decolonization In the heady early days of independence, the elites of former British and French colonies suffered from a sense of alienation resulting from their respective colonial languages. Most of them declared their intention to replace the ex-colonial language by the local native tongue(s). On the British side, India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, declared that ‘within one generation’ English would no longer be used in his country (McCrum et al. 1992: 22). On the French side, Algerian leaders showed some kind of ‘revo- lutionary zeal’ (Sirles 1999: 122–123) in displacing French because of lin- gering bitterness towards France (Benrabah 2007a: 193–194). They believed in the future creation of a ‘new Algerian’ trained to think in Classical Arabic and who ‘abordera les années 80 qui s’annoncent comme un grand tournant dans l’histoire de l’humanité’ (Taleb Ibrahimi 1981: 80). By the 1970s/1980s, most Indians would admit that English was as much part of the linguistic profile of India as Hindi. It was seen as a ‘neutral’ language which allowed different communities to live together and to preserve their own language and culture. And with the passage of time, the resentment caused by colonialism has died down in the minds of the younger generations. For example, in 1978, the Indian writer/philoso- pher Raja Rao wrote: 254 Mohamed Benrabah IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 254 Truth, said a great Indian sage, is not the monopoly of the Sanskrit language. Truth can use any language, and the more universal, the better it is. If metaphysics is India’s primary contribution to world civilization, as we believe it is, then must she use the most universal language for her to be universal [. . .] And as long as the English language is universal, it will always remain Indian [. . .] It would then be correct to say as long as we are Indian – that is, not nationalists, but truly Indians of the Indian psyche – we shall have the English language with us and amongst us, and not as a guest or Friend, but as one of our own, of our caste, our creed, our sect and our tradition. (quoted in Kachru 1986: 12) Today, I am not aware of any major trend in former British colonies to dis- place English in the foreseeable future. This is not the case for the Francophone world: a number of observers believe in the receding of French in West Africa in the near future, to the benefit of the national lan- guages and English (Chaudenson 2003; Chumbow and Bobda 2000). Yet it is in Africa where the putative future of French as a world language lies (Chaudenson 2003: 294; Roy 2008: 23). Dissatisfaction with French comes from three sources at least. First, in most Sub-Saharan countries, which refused local native tongues and preferred French as the main – often the only – language in their educational systems after independence, there are now strong negative reactions towards the ex-colonizer’s lan- guage. In its report published in 2000, the ‘Conseil International de la Langue Française’ (CILF) wonders whether it is ‘normal de demander à des millions d’enfants d’acquérir les outils de base du savoir dans une langue qui n’est pas la leur’ (CILF 2000: 15). It also claims that the African educational system in French has become ‘une fabrique de chômeurs’ (CILF 2000: 14). One might add that it manufactures illiteracy since the literacy rate remains low in Francophone Africa. In 1995, liter- acy was 65% in the Cameroon, 45% in Côte d’Ivoire and Togo, 28% in Benin and Niger, 25% in Mali, 18% in Burkina Faso, and 10% in Senegal (Chumbow and Bobda 2000: 46). Almost five decades after Sub-Saharan countries were granted independence, there are still academics who demand equal partnership: L’avenir de la langue française ne sera vraiment assuré en Afrique que si ce continent connaît une véritable expansion économique grâce au français. En clair, le partenariat langues africaines-langue française ne peut être un partenariat ‘gagnant-gagnant’ que si la langue française se met résolument au service du développement de l’Afrique. (Bikoï 2007: 2) The second source of disillusionment stems from the postcolonial political practices of France. Jacques Maurais (2003: 15) claims that ‘The French language is receding in Africa because of France’s Byzantine manner of doing politics’. The manner of doing politics Maurais refers to dates back to the early days of independence as well as to the system of rule instituted during colonization. A comparison of the British and French colonial policy is necessary here to understand the different positions of French and English in Africa today. The British adopted a policy of indirect rule which encouraged local 255‘Open’ and ‘closed’ languages in the postcolonial era IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 255 forms of control and institutions as a way of enforcing colonial govern- ment policy. The French, on the other hand, used a policy of direct rule whereby government officials were appointed by and accountable to Paris, leaving no room for indigenous autonomy or local industrial development. In the area of culture, the British respected local customs and traditions while the French policy was cultural assimilation of the peoples they colo- nized, the French language being considered as an essential instrument of assimilation (Safran 1999: 43). Moreover, their assimilationist beliefs made the French become involved with colonial life to the point of being subjective. By contrast, the British viewed their colonial subjects from a distance and treated colonial life in a detached and somewhat objective manner (Tsabedze 1994: 7–10). To Muslim colonial subjects in particular, the British cultural aloofness was more tolerable than the French attempt to integrate. ‘The French-Muslim conflict was therefore more a cultural one than was the case with the British, where emphasis was placed on the desire for self-government’ (Tsabedze 1994: 9). From the moment independence was granted, the differences of style between the two imperialisms was clear. For the British, independence meant a definitive break, but for the French the new nations had to remain tied to France which would remain a sub-hegemonic power on the international scene and police the region (Breton 2003: 207). Within this neo-colonial policy, the successive French leaders have gained the reputa- tion of supporting African dictators against the will of local populations. In fact, there are far more authoritarian regimes in former French colonies than in former British imperial possessions (Benrabah 2009: 176-181). Moreover, for the last few decades, French governments have openly favoured African politicians who squander public money to grow wealthy at the expense of their own people, considered the poorest in the world, even when their countries produce raw materials such as oil (Bernard 2008: 20–21). Achille Mbembe, an African intellectual and specialist in postcolonial studies, argues quite convincingly that ‘en Afrique francoph- one, [. . .] la France est perçue comme l’un des principaux obstacles à l’émancipation de l’Afrique’ (Mbembe 2007: 32). The process of ‘de-ethnicization’ The third and final source of dissatisfaction with French is to be found in the correlation between language and nationalism/ethnicity (culture). In this respect, languages can be classified into two major categories depend- ing on their speakers’ attitudes: how they perceive others as potential speakers of their own language (Wardhaugh 1987: 14–16). On the one hand, there are ‘closed’ languages which tend to be associated with one culture and whose potential speakers must subscribe to a set of values that is not theirs. Such a language is tied to a particular social, political, economic or religious system, or even to a specific racial or cultural com- munity. A ‘closed’ language can also be characterized by its native sub- jects’ refusal to accept different linguistic varieties as legitimate and autonomous forms of their mother tongue. Its speakers do not approve of its being spoken in any but its most ‘correct’ form, the form which they them- selves use and/or they perceive as being the ‘best’. ‘Open’ languages on the other hand are not tied to any set of values and no cultural requirements 256 Mohamed Benrabah IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 256 are necessary to learn them. Tied to no particular social, political, reli- gious or ethnic group, this type of language belongs to no one and every- one can use it as if it were their own property. Another feature of language openness concerns native speakers’ readiness to be accepting of differences in the ways people around the world use it. When we contrast French and English in the field of attitudes towards others as potential speakers and owners, it is quite clear that the former is ‘closed’ and the latter ‘open’. According to Laponce, Some languages have at some time of their historical evolution been more or less closed than others. French and English are no longer as tied to specific religions as they used to be and the ties between English and national origin are becoming more and more indistinct. Arabic has an intimate bond to Islam. The openness or exclusiveness of a language will vary according to the attitude taken toward ethnicity. (Laponce 1987: 28–29) Closely connected with Islam, Arabic shows little or no ‘openness’ to the world and its status as a major language depends largely on the expansion of the Islamic faith (Benrabah 2009: 151–161). In contrast to Arabic, English can be described as the most ‘open’ language in the world today. It is not tied to any religion and neither the Americans nor the British could claim to be its exclusive owners: its national origin has been blurred. In fact, the future of English lies now in the hands of its non-native users who outnumber the natives in the proportion 3:1 (Crystal 2003: 59–71 and 140–141). Learners are not required to adhere to any specific set of values because the target language does not necessarily need to be identified with any ethnic group or ideology: it has become everyone’s language. Being ‘relatively unencum- bered in the ethnic or ideological sphere’, English has been ‘de-ethnicized (or minimally ethnicized)’ more recently: that is, ‘neither its British nor its American fountainheads have been widely or deeply viewed in an ethnic or ideological context for the past quarter century or so’ (Fishman 1977: 118–119, original emphasis). Consequently, although English is apolitical on one level (no language is political in itself) it is sometimes put to immensely political uses (Spichtinger 2000: 35). For example, in the South Asian sub-continent English is used by such diverse groups as Communists, Muslim Fundamentalists and Hindu Rightists as well as factions of the Congress Party (Kachru 1985: 14). The process of de-ethnicization has allowed English to more or less rid itself of its imperial past. I say ‘more or less’ because with such a politically charged topic as the spread of English in a global context, people who fear change and the unknown tend to project their fear onto English and its current powerful carrier, the United States. In fact, the unchallenged monopoly of English in the world is often equated with US global hegemony and its cultural homogenizing power within globalization – a process called by some ‘McWorld’ to refer to America’s ‘economic totalitarianism’ (Barber 1996: 73–74). So ‘much of the negative reaction to English in the world is directed toward the US’ (Graddol 1997: 57). Thus, hostility towards the United States is directed towards American language (and culture) described by some quarters as ‘imperialistic’ – if no language is by itself ‘imperialistic’, its users can exert hegemonic control. For example, in his description of the 257‘Open’ and ‘closed’ languages in the postcolonial era IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 257 spread of English in Japan, Yukio Tsuda shows strong hostility toward American culture when he equates anyone eating a McDonald’s ham- burger with ‘an ardent believer of American culture’ (1997: 24). Another major development of the post-colonial ear is language appro- priation in former British colonies and the birth of indigenized forms of English. Such novel linguistic varieties, sometimes called ‘New Englishes’, are readily accepted as autonomous language forms. This development comes mainly from the detached attitudes of the British towards their sub- jects during the colonial era. After decolonization, such attitudes have been translated into a tendency among natives to accept other peoples’ ways of using English. In this respect, native English speakers do not seem to be very possessive of their mother tongue. They even consider the appropriation of their language by others as beneficial since it might bring new possibilities for them. McCabe elaborates: Whereas for two centuries we exported our language and our customs in hot pursuit of [. . .] fresh markets, we now find that our language and our customs are returned to us but altered so that they can be used by others [. . .] so that our own language and culture discover new possibilities, fresh con- tradictions. (McCabe 1985: 45) From the ex-colonized subjects’ point of view, the issue of linguistic norms has been settled through a process of language appropriation which is apparent in two aspects at least. First, pedagogical materials for the teach- ing of English which were first criticized for being too Anglo-centric, have been modified by governments to suit local demands by using indigenous materials. Consequently, the approach centred around the native-speaker and often based on ethnocentric, unrealistic, puristic, intolerant and unpragmatic views is less and less accepted in the English-speaking Periphery (Spichtinger 2000: 23 and 30). Second, in most former British colonies, the pressure to conform to the Centre (external) linguistic stan- dards (American, British, etc.) is slowly being resolved in favour of indige- nous educated norms. For instance, the majority of Indians prefer their own brand of English (Kachru 1986: 23 and 25). We can contrast this situation with French. As stated by Jean Laponce (1987) above, French is no longer tied to any religion. But unlike English, the equation of the French language to its national origin/culture is still very much alive. Being encumbered in the ethnic and ideological sphere, French can be characterized as a ‘closed’ language. This feature remains an important cornerstone of French language policy which is itself based on an exclusive linguistic culture or ideology. In his description of the methods adopted in France to deal with the language issue, Calvet (1999: 261–262) gives four approaches, two of which are relevant here: (1) colo- nialism or linguistic expansionism beyond the frontiers of the country, and (2) xenophobic linguistic purism on the level of the national language. Let us take each of these two approaches in turn and see how they have affected post-colonial developments. It was mentioned earlier that after former colonies were granted independence, the British chose a definitive break with their old imperial possessions but not the French. When they became independent, many 258 Mohamed Benrabah IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 258 former Francophone colonies ignored their local tongues in their lan- guage-planning endeavour. And even today, most of them still follow the recommendation of the 1944 Brazzaville conference that French be the exclusive language for the educational system in France’s former posses- sions in Africa (Spolsky 2004: 138) – such a recommendation is based on the following ethnocentric belief: some colonial/dominant nations natu- rally have better languages than others (Coulmas 1989: 181). These post- independence choices have had far-reaching consequences on African populations which are now plagued by high rates of illiteracy and unem- ployment. It is probably a French public official who best expressed the exclusive nature of French linguistic culture when he said: ‘the French God has always been a jealous God. He can be worshipped only in French [. . .] [a language] whose jealous cult can never have too many altars’ (Weber 1984: 73). As far as linguistic expansionism and the anglophone world are con- cerned, voices have been raised against English as an imperialist language. In fact, some scholars who are carried away by (left-wing) ideology main- tain that the current domination of English and its teaching is a direct continuation of the colonial imperialist practices. The most notable propo- nent of ‘linguistic imperialism’ is Robert Phillipson (1992) who argues that the promotion of English is a form of western domination over the ex- colonized countries and a way to legitimate a continued British presence in former colonies. He insists on the use of native languages as a counter- measure against the spread of English. In addition to being patronizing – Phillipson speaks for the ex-colonized people with the assumption that these people are negatively affected by Centre hegemonic control and are incapable of independent decision (Bisong 1995: 131; Davies 1996: 495) –, he is victim of his own ideological world view: his linguistic culture based on subtractive ‘monolingual habitus’ (one language, one nation, one nation, one language) has prevented him from realizing the nature of mul- tilingual societies. In most ex-colonies, peoples’ attitudes are often in favour of additive bilingualism/multilingualism: they use the ex-colonial language(s) (French, English, etc.) pragmatically so as to allow their chil- dren grow up multilingually (Bisong 1995: 125). Consequently, western observers simply misrepresent linguistic rivalry in their former imperial possessions (Benrabah 2007b: 122). All in all, Phillipson’s (1992) claims are too simplistic to account for the complex linguistic situation of multi- lingual societies. As for linguistic purism, which was so common among nationalists in the nineteenth century (European ethnocentrism), it implies a cultur- ally/linguistically homogeneous environment and is thus related to the above: it is often correlated with the ‘monolingual habitus’ of communities in which linguistic identity is equated with national identity. Furthermore, linguistic purism as an expression of xenophobia has at least two objec- tives: it is directed towards both outsiders and insiders. For example, the war against Anglicisms in France views English as an invading language with the capacity to interfere with and pollute the very internal (linguis- tic) structure of French, considered to be miraculously closer to that of pure, language-free thought than the structure of other languages (Lodge 1998: 26). In fact, linguistic purism used as a banner against another 259‘Open’ and ‘closed’ languages in the postcolonial era IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 259 language is not new: strong measures were taken in France to resist the incursion of Italianisms when the Italian language became a major world language in the Renaissance and on into the sixteenth century (Schiffman 1996: 85; Mauviel 2000: 58-59). I have to admit that the English language is no exception: it is not immune to ethnocentric views of linguistic purity. As early as the thirteenth century, war was waged against Latin words in England – in 1230, the lexical item inwit was created as a substitute for the Latin word conscience (Lewis 1999: 2). In 1561, Sir John Cheke wrote about English: ‘Our lan- guage should be written clean and pure, unmixed and unmangled with bor- rowing of other tongues, wherein if we take no heed by time, ever borrowing and never paying, she shall be fain to keep her house as bankrupt’ (quoted in Coulmas 1989: 191). Linguistic purity intensified during the rise of nation- alist ideology in the nineteenth century with attempts to replace Latin and Greek vocabulary by ‘saxonisms’ (Lewis 1999: 2). As far as recent examples are concerned, mention should be made of self-appointed custodians of the English language. There are on the one hand those who fear their language ‘going down the drain’ and put the blame on native speakers from different national communities: witness Prince Charles’s comments in March 1995 when he ‘described American English as ‘very corrupting’ and emphasized the need to maintain the quality of language’ (Jenkins 2003: 4-5). On the other hand, there are those who fear non-native speakers’ ‘corrupting’ power, as described by Henry Widdowson: On the one hand there is pride, complacency even, that English has become an international means of communication, but on the other hand there is grave concern that it might be misused, corrupted in the mouths of all these foreigners. (Widdowson 1993: 323) However, when comparing French and English attitudes towards linguistic purism, it is clear that ‘the French experience has been a long and consis- tent one’ (Parker 2000: 180). An experience which is still very much alive today: among France’s establishment whose job is to defend French there are those who strongly believe in the superiority of their language and at the same express racist views on the ex-colonial subjects. Hélène Carrère d’Encausse fits in nicely within this category. In a 2002 public meeting of the ‘Académie française’, she claimed that three centuries ago, the whole of Europe adopted French because of its special linguistic qualities such as its ‘clarity’, the ‘precision’ of its vocabulary, ‘the range of its verbal structures’, and ‘the power of its syntax’ (Wright 2006: 35). When angry young men rioted in France’s suburbs in November 2005, Carrère d’Encausse put the blame on African polygamy that she associated with the immigrant popula- tions of the Hexagon. When she made these claims in 2005, she was the secrétaire perpétuel of the ‘Académie française’, an institution meant to defend French and its spread in the world (Benrabah 2009: 69). The correlation between France and the French language tends to create a sense of defeat of the former when other languages disqualify the latter as a dominant language. In the mid-1980s, the great French histo- rian Fernand Braudel stated: ‘Dans la mesure où [la langue française] n’est plus prééminente, comme ce fut le cas aux dix-huitième et dix-neuvième 260 Mohamed Benrabah IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 260 siècles, nous sommes dans une crise de la culture française’ (Kajman 1985: 8). In other words, there is a cultural crisis in France unless the world is under French linguistic and cultural imperialism. One has to accept George Weber’s claim when he writes: The speakers of some languages have seen the influence of their own lan- guage checked by one of the [. . .] top languages. They then usually profess a fear of being dominated – while at the same time their own language in turn is driving smaller local languages towards extinction. Few even notice the irony of this and loud are the complaints about linguistic and cultural expansionism. Expansionism is what others do to you that you cannot do to them but would if you could. (Weber 1999: 25) Refusal to accept the Other: ‘littérature francophone’ According to Wardhaugh (1987: 14) ‘[French language] policy is not without its dangers and may contain within it the seeds of its own destruc- tion: a refusal to accept one may lead to a refusal to accept the Other.’ The present author is of the view that French is retreating because of what Wardhaugh calls the ‘refusal to accept the Other’, the insider who has acquired this language as a non-native user. Such a situation has been affected by language attitudes, since The French are possessive of their language. They do not approve of its being spoken in any but its most ‘correct’ form, the form it takes in metropolitan France, and even speakers of French from Quebec are likely to find them- selves patronized for the way they speak the language when they have occa- sion to visit France. (Wardhaugh 1987: 14) Unlike most native speakers of English, the French are much less accepting of differences in the ways in which their language is spoken and used in the world. However, the ‘refusal to accept the Other’ is best illustrated by the French intelligentsia’s perception of speakers of French or French-speaking writers whose origin is not French (metropolitan France). It is in fact a colonial per- ception founded on xenophobic linguistic purism and the fear of the Other, the one who does not belong to the common history of the Hexagon or who was part of it but as a subordinate or colonized subject. France’s cultural establishment persists setting itself apart from those who come from former colonies: only those writers who are French of stock are French authors; the Others are Francophone writers. Some recurrent questions put to the latter are part of French intelligentsia’s stock-in-trade. For example, a few days before the book fair held in Paris in March 2006 (‘Salon du Livre 2006’), two major French dailies published special issues on this cultural event. Libération (Miano 2006) asked thirty-one authors to answer the question ‘Pourquoi écrivez-vous en français?’ and Le Monde (Nimrod 2006) published nine authors’ answers to the question ‘Quel français écrivez-vous?’ Incidently, the 2006 Paris book fair called in French ‘2006: l’année des fran- cophonies’ was dedicated to ...multiple francophonias. A simple and surface analysis of the questions asked by both dailies shows the presence of a suspicious feeling towards the chosen authors as to their 261‘Open’ and ‘closed’ languages in the postcolonial era IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 261 motivation and their mastery of the French language. In fact, several writers criticized the aberration pointed out here. Chad-born Nimrod (2006: 2) said that ‘pour l’Africain que je suis, la question est suspecte’. Boubacar Boris Diop, a Senegalese author, read in Libération’s question ‘une meurtrière invita- tion au silence [. . .]’. For him, the question was even more brutal: it implied ‘Pourquoi donc vous obstinez-vous à écrire [en français]?’ (Diop 2006: 2). Léonora Miano, from Cameroon, refuted the common belief shared by France’s educated elite: ‘Pour la plupart des gens, la langue française appar- tient aux autochtones de ce beau pays de France. Ce n’est pas mon point de vue’ (Miano 2006: 16). Asked why he refused to write in French despite his upbringing in a French-speaking environment, Turkish author Orhan Pamuk used linguistic insecurity as his justification: ‘l’impression de suffisance que dégage le français, ce sentiment que tout y est parfait procurent aux étrangers qui y croient une sensation d’impuissance’ (2006: 34). Haiti-born René Depestre’s answer to Libération was meant to ‘crier haro sur toute conception nationaliste, raciste, intégriste de la langue’ (2006: 20). Ying Chen, whose origin is Chinese, thought that Le Monde’s question implied that people who did not have French as their mother tongue were alien translators: ‘[il se degage] tout de suite une évidente étrangeté, un écart indicible loin du normal, dans l’usage des mots et dans la façon de composer les phrases’ (Chen 2006: 2). Congolese writer Alain Mabanckou justified his foreign accent in his books as follows: ‘Je ne renierai jamais l’influence des langues africaines – et c’est sans doute pour cela que j’ai un accent, même dans mes livres’ (2006: 10). It is certainly the Montreal-author Monique Proulx who argued most vehemently when she said that the very asking Libération’s ques- tion was ‘malpoli’ and ‘terriblement parisianiste’. And she added: Ne voyez-vous pas que dans la façon de formuler vos questions, de traiter de francophonie comme si vous n’en étiez pas (d’un côté les Français – c’est-à- dire les authentiques, les seuls à l’avoir, l’affaire – et de l’autre, la francopho- nie, tous métèques et sous-produits plus ou moins rachitiques des premiers). (Proulx 2006: 23). In his answer to Libération’s question, Boubacar Boris Diop also points to an issue that is central to the present IJFS volume: ‘On peut se demander au passage par quelle aberration sémantique un auteur français n’est jamais appelé francophone.’ (Diop 2006: 25) The Senegalese writer addresses the debate over the dichotomy ‘littérature francophone’ versus ‘littérature-monde en français’. Among France’s educated elites who prefer the former concept, there is a tendency to confine writers like Diop to the ‘francophone’ ghetto, separate from ‘français de France’. According to Moroccan-born Tahar Ben Djelloun, there is a ‘distinction entre une lit- térature ‘noire’ et une autre ‘blanche’, une littérature ‘de souche’ et une autre ‘métèque’’ (Ben Jelloun 2008: 40). Amin Maalouf believes that the French intelligentsia’s insistence on separating French-speaking writers denotes a nationalist attitude and ‘pour se démarquer à tout prix de ces poètes étranges qui viennent de si loin pour lui voler sa langue’ (Maalouf 2006: 2). Maalouf ’s paper was entitled ‘Contre la littérature francophone’ as an echo to Salman Rushdie’s comments in his essay called ‘Commonwealth literature does not exist’, published fifteen years earlier. 262 Mohamed Benrabah IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 262 The Indian-British writer wrote: ‘the English language ceased to be the sole possession of the English some time ago’ (quoted in Crystal 2003: 140). Before Rushdie made these comments, the Indian-American soci- olinguist Braj Kachru had claimed that as soon as English acquired a new identity through colonized subjects’ creative writing, the language was lib- erated from its colonial past (1997: 232). The very same year that Amin Maalouf wrote against ‘littérature francophone’, Alain Mabanckou claimed in his answer to Libération’s question: ‘Cher monsieur, la France n’a plus le monopole du français depuis longtemps. Cette langue est aussi mienne, comme le lingala, comme le kikongo ou le bembé.’ (2006: 10) The above ‘Francophone’ writers’ comments have been more or less influ- enced by the ‘open’ practices found in the Spanish- and English-speaking worlds where people do not distinguish between ‘Spanish’ and ‘Hispanophone’ writers on the one hand, and ‘English’ and ‘Anglophone’ writers on the other (Maalouf 2006 : 2). (In the Anglophone world, writers of non-English origin are frequently referred to as ‘Indian-born writers’, or ‘born in the UK immi- grants from Pakistan’, etc., but these expressions are not necessarily negative.) Tahar Ben Jelloun clearly states such an influence when he writes: Les Britanniques n’ont pas eu besoin de créer des institutions en vue de pro- mouvoir l’’anglophonie’. Ils considèrent leurs écrivains nés hors de leurs frontières et écrivant en anglais comme des écrivains anglais. Il n’y a pas de débat, pas de conflit, pas d’ambiguïté. J’ai demandé un jour à Salman Rushdie s’il se considère comme un écrivain britannique. Il m’a répondu : ‘Oui, bien sûr, mais je suis aussi un écrivain indien, simplement parce que ma source d’inspiration est principalement indienne.’ J’ai posé la même question à Hanif Kureishi, dont les parents sont du Pakistan. ‘Ecrivain anglais, évidemment !’, a-t-il répondu. Quoi qu’il en soit, ces écrivains qui ne sont pas britanniques de souche vivent et écrivent comme s’ils étaient des Anglais avec un imaginaire spécifique, sont perçus et lus comme des auteurs anglais, au même titre que John Le Carré ou Martin Amis. (2008: 40–41) Not to be too harsh on French media in relation to ‘Francophone’ writers, I have to mention certain quarters of France’s intelligentsia (journalists, writers, etc) who often refer in a positive manner to non-French writers who choose to publish in French: they feel flattered and proud that non- native speakers adopt French for their creative work. And it is within this context that, a year after the 2006 Paris book fair took place, forty-four French and non-French writers signed the manifesto in favour of the French language ‘libérée de son pacte exclusif avec la nation’ and in favour of the ‘décès de la francophonie’ (Barbery et al. 2007: 2) Political expressions of the bitterness that lingers Thus a comparison of post-colonial developments for English and French reveals that the former has been liberated from its colonial past but not the latter. The major reason for this lies in the ties between language and national origin: they have become indistinct for English but not for French. The most convincing evidence comes from former colonized subjects’ (political) reactions to French and English respectively. 263‘Open’ and ‘closed’ languages in the postcolonial era IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 263 Whenever a crisis arises between the government of the Hexagon’s and those of former colonies, the future of the French language is at stake. The most recent conflict was between France and Rwanda. A few days before the Francophone Summit was held in Quebec in October 2008, the Rwandan regime decided to have French replaced by English as the major language in the educational system, from primary school to university (Afrik.Com 2008). Similar ‘reprisals’ were taken in the Maghreb in the past. After President Ben Ali was re-elected for the third time in October 1999, the international media were very critical of the Tunisian leader’s security para- noia and the ‘soviet-style’ score of his re-election which stood at 99.4% (Aubenas 2000: 14). After accusing France’s government of orchestrating the international campaign against him, the Tunisian President revived a 1993 law prohibiting the use of French in public. According to Le Monde journalist, this Arabization drive targeted ‘plus directement l’ancienne puis- sance coloniale.’ (Tuquoi 2000: 3). Hence, for the French cultural establish- ment, a move against French is seen as a blow to France. What is more, leaders in former colonies know it and they act accordingly. In Algeria, where the memory of the colonial era is still very much alive, retaliation against the French language is usual practice. In the early 1970s, a conflict rose between France and Algeria after the Algerian gov- ernment’s nationalization of oil. When the French decided a trade boycott of Algerian oil, the Algerian authorities implemented a policy of systematic Arabisation (Benrabah 1999: 117). Two decades later, the Fundamentalists and conservatives, dominant in primary and secondary education, chose English to replace French as the chief foreign language in schools. They put forward two arguments to justify their choice: English was ‘the language of scientific knowledge’ (HCF 1999: 28) and French was ‘par essence’ une langue ‘impérialiste’ et ‘colonialiste’’ (Goumeziane 1994: 258). Ironically, the second justification above completely ignores the imper- ial past of English. The liberation of English from this past prevents it from ‘reprisals’ in the English-speaking world, even when relations are tense between the United Kingdom (or the United States) and the governing elites of former British imperial possessions. Zimbabwe, which has made headline news lately, is a good illustration. President Mugabe has been under British and American pressure for the last few years and yet the Zimbabwean dictator has never attacked the status of the ex-colonial lan- guage in his country even when directly accusing the British (and the Americans) of colonial nostalgia. If bitterness about British colonisation is still alive, it just is not expressed in relation to the language. Apart from linguistic de-ethnicisation, other possible reasons for this lack of bitterness towards English include language usefulness: unlike French, English turns out to be very useful as a tools for acquiring and producing knowledge and as the current world lingua franca of money (Spichtinger 2000: 23). Conclusion When, speaking in all sincerity, Fernand Braudel says ‘La France, c’est la langue française’ (Kajman 1985: 8), he points out the crucial role played by language in defining national community and membership for the French people. After France’s colonial empire was dismantled, the mainte- nance of such close ties between ‘Language’ and ‘Nation’ has worked 264 Mohamed Benrabah IJFS_12-2&3_06-Benrabah_100006 2/4/10 6:43 PM Page 264 against the French language outside France. By contrast, English has been more successful because it has been de-ethnicized: the ties between lan- guage and national origin are more or less indistinct today. Such a process gives the ex-colonial subjects psychological distance between English and its past, even though bitterness about colonisation has not completely dis- appeared. The lack of de-ethnicization for French allows bitterness to linger, making it ‘in essence imperialist and colonialist’, a state which has proved to be a boon to dictators in search of scapegoats in times of difficulty. The displacement of French by English on the international scene has not loosened the ties between language and national origin. It has even exacerbated the linguistic possessiveness and exclusiveness of French edu- cated elites. This feeling is particularly strong among those who are often nostalgic for the colonial empire (El Karoui 2006: 71 and 78) and who prefer the French language to be a hegemonic leader and not a partner in former colonies and/or at the world level. It is an exclusive linguistic culture based on linguistic assimilation which can easily refuse to accept the Other. The refusal of the Other is apparent in attitudes towards writers who come from former colonies. The appropriation of the French language by former imperial subordinates has given rise to fears of being dispossessed by what Amin Maalouf has called ‘language thieves’ (2006: 2). One way of dealing with such fears is the creation of categories like ‘littérature francophone’ which are exclusive and which keep French a ‘closed’ language. Theorists such as Ernest Gellner (1983) and Benedict Anderson (1991) have noted the central role played by an intelligentsia in, among other things, encoding the discourses, practices, and media products which individuals use to construct their identities. Hence, openness for French requires a change in the linguistic culture shared by France’s intel- ligentsia: it needs a change in the thinking mode. The cultural elites of the Hexagon should adopt more detached attitudes towards their mother tongue, allowing it to be liberated from its national origin (Telmissany 2007: 21). They should also view ‘language thieves’ as equal partners who could boost French language and culture by providing it with what Mohammed Dib (1993: 30) described as ‘[u]n goût qu’ils ne lui connais- sent pas.’ In other words, a new French linguistic culture needs to accept new possibilities, fresh contradictions, and language hybridity as a cure to linguistic purism. Fresh thinking has to acknowledge the new reality as described by Donald Morrison: France has become a multiethnic bazaar of art, music and writing from the banlieues and disparate corners of the nonwhite world. [. . .] And when the more conventional minds of the French cultural establishment – along with their self-occupied counterparts abroad – stop fretting about decline and start applauding the ferment on the fringes, France will reclaim its reputa- tion as a cultural power, a land where every new season brings a harvest of genius.
