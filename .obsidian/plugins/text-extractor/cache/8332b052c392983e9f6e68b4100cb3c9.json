To make drivers aware of expectations of driving safety 2. To make sure that employees who drive vehicles in the course of their work demonstrate safe, eﬃcient driving skills and other good road safety habits, at all times 3. To maintain all vehicles in a safe, clean and roadworthy condition to ensure the maximum safety of the drivers, occupants and others on the road Code of Conduct: The code of conduct for Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates states: “While driving with our clients, employees must comply with all traﬃc laws, be conscious of road safety and demonstrate safe driving and other good road safety habits.” Page 1 of 3 Employees are expected to adhere to the following guidelines, in alignment with Maine law: Seatbelts: Everyone in the vehicle must be properly secured in a seatbelt, including passengers and driver.   Rear-Facing Car Seat: If a child is under the age of 24 months, they must always travel in a rear-facing seat. If the child exceeds the height and weight limit set by the manufacturer, then they can travel in the forward-facing car seat.   Regular Car Seat: Children weighing less than 55 pounds must be in a car seat with a 5 point harness.   Booster Seat/Car Seat: If a client/child weighs 55-79 pounds, they may use either a car seat or booster seat, based on manufacturer’s recommendations.     No Car Seat: Keep client/child in a booster seat until he or she is big enough to ﬁt in a seat belt properly.  For a seat belt to ﬁt properly the lap belt must lie snugly across the upper thighs, not the stomach. The shoulder belt should lie snug across the shoulder and chest and not across the neck or face. Remember: client/child should still ride in the back seat, because it’s safer there.    Front Seat: Client/child must be 12 years or older and weigh more than 100 pounds to sit in the front seat.   Texting: Employees must never text and drive. Page 2 of 3 Hands-Free Driving Law: Legally, you can place a call while driving, but the phone cannot be held to your ear. You may use voice commands to make a call or if your mobile telephone is mounted or aﬃxed to the vehicle, you may use your hand to push, swipe or tap the phone to activate or deactivate a feature or function. However, Counseling and Trauma Therapy Associates asks that you do not receive or make calls with clients in your vehicle.   Current Driver’s License: Make sure you always hold a current driver’s license. Immediately notify the Agency Director if your driver’s license has been suspended or canceled, or has had limitations placed upon it.   Be Aware: Be responsible and accountable for actions when operating a vehicle for the purposes of work. Assess hazards while driving and anticipate ‘what if’ scenarios.   Substance Free: Only drive when ﬁt to do so – never drive under the inﬂuence of alcohol or drugs, including prescription and over the counter medication if they cause drowsiness.   Registered, Inspected, and Insured: Only use a car that is inspected, legally registered, and insured for the purposes of work – the employee must show evidence of this upon request.
