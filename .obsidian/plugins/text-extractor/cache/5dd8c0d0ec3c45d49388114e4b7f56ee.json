EXAMPLE: 1 Consider a pick three lottery where a ticket costs $1 and if you win (meaning you pick the correct 3 numbers), you collect $500. You pick 3 numbers, each 0 through 9. For example, you could pick 3, 7, 8 or 2, 6, 9. There are 10 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) each time you pick. P (choosing the correct 3 numbers) = = 0.001. P (you win) = 0.001 P (you lose) = 0.999 Here is the formula for calculating expected value. In this case, the expected value of your $1 lottery ticket. Note that the * indicates multiplication. E = Σ [ x * P(x) ] The symbol Σ is telling you to add stuff. x represents the events that can randomly happen. In this case, you randomly collect $500 or lose your $1. P (x) is the probability of those random events happening. Keep in mind that if you do win, your actual (net) gain is $499, because you had to pay $1 for the ticket. 1 10 × 1 10 × 1 10 = 1 103 = 1 1,000 Let’s summarize the information in a 4 by 4 table: We have followed the instructions given by E = Σ [ x * P(x) ]. We have multiplied across, each x by its P (x), placing the results in the last column. We then added those results. The expected value = -50¢ Conclusion: The expected value of the $1 ticket is -50¢. The lottery commission makes an average of 50¢ on every ticket, even with the occasional payout of the $500 prize. Event x P (x) x * P (x) Lose -$1 0.999 -0.999 Win + $499 0.001 +0.499 Total -0.50 EXAMPLE 2: Consider a one-year life insurance policy for a 30-year-old man. This policy costs $161 and pays the beneficiary $100,000. The probability that a randomly selected 30-year-old man will live through the year is 0.9986. What is the expected value of this one-year policy? P (live) = 0.9986 P (die) = 0.0014 Keep in mind that the net payout is $99,839, because we must deduct the $161 cost of the policy. Let’s summarize the information in a 4 by 4 table: We have followed the instructions given by E = Σ [ x * P(x) ]. We have multiplied across, each x by its P (x), placing the results in the last column. We then added those results. The expected value = -$21 Conclusion: The expected value of such a policy is -$21. The insurance company makes an average of $21 on every such policy, even with the occasional payout of the $100.000 benefit. Event x P (x) x * P (x) Live -$161 0.9986 -$160.78 Die + $99,839 0.0014 $139.78 Total -$21 EXAMPLE 3: A roulette wheel is comprised of 38 wedges. (Like a big apple pie cut into 38 slices.) There is a wedge labeled 0 and a wedge labeled 00. The other 36 wedges are labeled 1 through 36. The wheel is spun and when it stops, the little marble on the wheel comes to rest in one of the wedges. Consider placing a $5 bet, with a $180 payout, that the marble will land in wedge #7. Since there are 38 wedges and only one of them is the #7: P (you win) = = 0.0263 P (you lose) = = 0.9737 Keep in mind that if you win, the payout is $180, but you had to pay $5 to place the bet. Your net gain is $175. Let’s summarize the information in a 4 by 4 table: We have followed the instructions given by E = Σ [ x * P(x) ]. We have multiplied across, each x by its P (x), placing the results in the last column. We then added those results. The expected value = -27¢ Conclusion: The expected value of such a bet is -27¢ The casino makes an average of 27¢ on every such bet, even with the occasional payout of $180. 1 38 37 38 Event x P (x) x * P (x) Lose -$5 0.9737 -$4.87 Win + $175 0.0263 $4.60 Total -$0.27","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
