Not only did Schopenhauer show great affection for other species and repeatedly criticize Western anthropocentrism, but he also argued that we could know a great deal about animals by intimately knowing ourselves. Although currently underdeveloped, Schopenhauer's intro- spective methodology sheds light on how we can begin to mend the epistemic human-animal boundary through his emphasis on immediate, concrete knowledge and intuition. In practice too, Schopenhauer's metaphysically grounded ethical system of compassion offers an alter- native to both utilitarianism and deontology to bridge the human-animal moral boundary. For Schopenhauer, if a person recognizes the identical, underlying substance of their self and the animal kingdom, he or she will extend loving kindness and Justice to all creatures. At the sight of animals, especially when they are free, my heart always goes out to them. —ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER' I.

There are a large number of secondary works regarding Schopenhauer's philosophy: e.g., Frederick Copleston, Arthur Schopenhauer: Philosopher of Pessimism (London: Search Press, 1975); John E. AtweW, Schopenhauer: The Human Character (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1990); Bryan Magee, The Philosophy of Schopenhauer (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997); Chris- topher Janaway, ed.. The Cambridge Companion to Schopenhauer (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999); and Dale Jacquette, The Philosophy of Schopenhauer (Ithaca: McGill-Queen's, 2005). However, unlike most nineteenth-century continental philosophers, Schopenhauer's style was fluid and unambiguous. That is, primary sources are more informative than secondary. ^ Schopenhauer's aesthetic system is founded around apprehending a revised interpretation of Platonic Ideas, or Forms, as \"pure, will-less subjects of knowing.\" The hope of Schopenhauer's aesthetics is for the individual to momentarily tame their will to achieve passing times of inner peace. Animals hold a 349 350 ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS Vol.35 were all highly influential, especially from the 1880s until the end of World War I.\"* He has influenced a diverse and wide range of scholars and artists, including Leo Tolstoy, Albert Einstein, Friedrich Nietzsche, Marcel Proust, Carl Jung, Richard Wagner, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Max Horkheimer, Sigmund Freud, Georg Simmel, Emile Durkheim, and Martin Heidegger, among many others. Schopenhauer's philosophical system is largely a synthesis and revision of Kantian transcendental idealism, Plato's theory of Ideas, and Eastern (specifically, Buddhist and Vedantic) asceticism and claims of universal oneness. Higgins soundly abridged the chief Kantian presumptions of Schopenhauer's philosophical system: Schopenhauer accepts Kant's distinction between the phenomenal world and the nou- menal world. The former is called, in Schopenhauer's idealistic scheme, the world as representation, for it is composed of objects constituted by the forms imposed by the conscious mind. The noumenal world, or thing-in-itself, is the reality underlying the world as representation. Schopenhauer disagrees with Kant that the thing-in-itself is inaccessible to us. Instead, he points out that each of us, in our own case, recognizes an immediate reality behind the phenomenal behavior of our own body. This inner reality is \"will.\" Schopenhauer extends this inner reality to all phenomena, concluding that \"Will\" is the thing-in-itself.^ For Schopenhauer, the Will (sometimes called the \"heart\") is the \"substance\" that makes up \"the sole kernel of every phenomenon.\"^ The Will is the blind, irrational, unappeasable, and continual striving for self-preservation that is felt and known immediately from within. Some have attempted to describe Schopenhauer's Will as \"energy\"'' or \"force.\"^ However, these suggestions are somewhat problematic. The reason Schopenhauer specifically used the rather ambiguous term Wille to de- scribe the underlying substance of all reality—a term traditionally used to describe human conation or activity—is it is known \"better than anything else\" through our bodily processes.' i considerable place in his aesthetics, as he believed \"every animal\" is beautiful, that observing nature, including animals, was \"delightful,\" argued paintings and sculptures of animals were more beautiful than architecture, and claimed that higher ripieno harmonies were metaphorical manifestations of the animal will.

See the section \"Feeling the Will of Animals\" for further discussion. i Fall 2013 ANIMAL EPISTEMOLOGY AND ETHICS 351 The Will manifests itself as a plurality of phenomenon in time and space, or, the principium individuationis (the principle of individuation). As the thing-in-itself, the Will is outside space, time, and causality but it \"objectifies\" itself at various \"grades\" and \"degrees\" from inorganic processes, to the vegetable kingdom, and, \"with the dawning of intelligence and consciousness,\" to the animal kingdom (in- cluding humanity),'\" This world, the worid as representation, is known to us through the intellect, or the \"mind,\" The world as representation is the objective worid of appearances that is categorized by, and contingent on, consciousness. Schopen- hauer described the intellect as \"secondary to,\" \"in service of,\" \"dependent on,\" a \"slave to,\" and a \"tool\" of the Will, Like Freud's analogy of the conscious mind as a garrison in the unconscious city,\" Schopenhauer described the Will's relation to intellect as a \"strong blind man carrying the sighted lame man on his shoulders.\"'^ Thus, Schopenhauer \"reverses Cartesianism\" (i,e,, the body is the root of philoso- phy, not the mind), and in doing so, strikes a blow to the Cartesian emphasis on the human mind as the basis of self, or ego,'^ Schopenhauer claimed animals too are \"very conscious ,, , of their ego in face of the world or the non-ego.\"\"' To counter the \"absurd statements\" about animals having no self, he stated that \"[i]f any Carte- sian were to find himself clawed by a tiger, he would become aware in the clearest possible manner of the sharp distinction such a beast draws between its ego and the non-ego,\"'^ In fact, many of Schopenhauer's critiques leveled at philosophers were due to their ignorance of the animal worid's heart and mind. For instance, the likes of Hegel, Schelling, and Fichte were denounced for ignoring the \"gradual shades\" of animal intellect, preaching a \"total and absolute difference\" between human and animals, and accepting a Christian theology that had \"forgotten the animals,\" He even attacked Spinoza for allegedly being cruel to insects for enjoyment,'* As I show below, Schopenhauer's philosophy not only counters a European tradition of philosophy that had \"forgotten the animals,\" but also offers techniques for philosophers and researchers to better understand animals without depending one-sidedly on deductive, rational, and positivistic logic and methods,''' This paper serves three purposes.

The practical and most important goal points to compassion as a means to reunite the bond between humans and animals that Schopenhauer felt had been severed by Judeo-Christianity. Below, Schopenhauer's general views on the animal's mind and heart are outlined, his criticisms of Western anthropocentrism are examined, and the reason why he felt justice and loving kindness should be shown to all creatures is explained. Schopenhauerian philosophy, which emphasizes the stable nature of suffering, particularly lends itself to feehng and knowing animal suffering in human society. Through Schopenhauer's introspective methods, one can leam to, as Schopenhauer put it, make a smaller \"distinction\" between their self and others, and, in tum, discover compassion as a metaethical means of restoring our broken bond with animals.'^ II, ANIMAL MIND AND WISDOM Schopenhauer felt that humans and animals are \"identical\" with one exception: the addition of reason {Vernunft) in human consciousness.\" For Schopenhauer, reason denoted the capacity to transfer immediate perception into abstraction to create conceptions, or, \"representations of [intuitive/perceptive] representations P^^ As Schopenhauer argued human consciousness is simply the addition of reason to animal consciousness, he felt that it \"must be possible to arrive at a complete knowledge of the consciousness of animals, in so far as we are able to construct such consciousness by merely taking away certain properties of our own.\"^' How- ever, unlike discovering the \"heart\" of animals through a corporal introspection (see below), Schopenhauer felt knowing the animal mind was more problematic because such an endeavor would be clouded by the faculty of reason.^^ Instead, he suggested observing the \"most sagacious\" animals (Schopenhauer was particularly fond of dogs, elephants, and nonhuman simians) to discover animal \"understand- ing.\"^^ Understanding denoted apprehending extemal objects through perception and intuition and applied to beings with conscious motives as the cause of activity (as opposed to stimuli-induced action, as in the case of plants). For Schopenhauer, all animals, including humans, have concrete knowledge ofthe phenomenal world in \"different gradations\" of acuteness. However, with the addition of reason to hu- man consciousness, \"[a] s from the direct light ofthe sun to the borrowed reflected light of the moon, so do we pass from the immediate representation of perception .. . to the abstract.\"^\"* '^ Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, vol. 1, p. 372. \" Schopenhauer argued there may be some \"traces\" of reason in select animal species; particularly in the elephant.

Fall 2013 ANIMAL EPISTEMOLOGYAND ETHICS 353 Schopenhauer did not celebrate human reason and rationality one-sidedly like many of his contemporaries. The addition of reason to animal consciousness (i,e,, human consciousness) was viewed from both positive and negative perspectives. On one hand, humans have the capacities for \"speech, reflectiveness, looking back at the past, care about the future, purpose, deliberation, the planned and systematic action of many in common, the state, the sciences, the arts, and so on ,\"^^ On the other hand, Schopenhauer felt that reason is what made human existence \"so artificial\" and \"so terrible ,\"^^ Schopenhauer argued that the capacity of reflection makes humans more susceptible to greater suffering than animals, as he saw the mental anguishes of anxiety and persistent hopes of need satisfaction (leading to disappointment and boredom) more miserable than physical suffering,^' In this, he felt animals to be \"wise\" in their \"calm and undisturbed enjoyment of the present moment.\"-^^ This wisdom is why Schopenhauer felt we find such pleasure in observing animals, [I]n man, prudence and discretion have made their appearance along with the faculty of reason and with this the ability to dissimulate, which at once casts a veil over him.... [O]ur pleasures in dogs, monkeys, cats, and others rests on ... the complete naïveté of all their expressions [and] is what affords so much amusement and delight. What a characteristic and peculiar pleasure there is at the sight of every free animal pursuing its business without let or hindrance, going in search of its food, tending its young, or consorting with others of its species! With all this it is so entirely what it should and can be. It may be only a tiny bird, yet I am long able to watch it with pleasure; or it may be a water-rat, frog, or better still a hedgehog, weasel, roe, or stag! That the sight of animals is so pleasant is due mainly to the fact that we are very delighted to see before us our own true nature so greatly simplified?^ To illustrate this point, Schopenhauer used the following analogy: \"The dog is re- lated to the man as a glass tumbler is to a metal one,\"^\" In other words, animals, in their \"innocence,\" present their self without the disguised emotions and artificiality that humans have developed with rationality. Although Schopenhauer refused to romanticize the natural world,^' he felt human instmmentality had something to leam from the innocent wisdom of animals. ^5 Arthur Schopenhauer, Prize Essay on the Freedom of the Will (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 29. -* Arthur Schopenhauer, \"On the Fourfold Root of the Principle Sufficient Reason,\" in Two Essays (London: George Bell and Sons, 1889), p. 114. ^^ Schopenhauer, Parerga and Paralipomena, vol. 2, pp. 293-98; Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, vol. 1, pp. 298-99. -' Schopenhauer, Parerga and Paralipomena, vol. 2, p. 296. ^^ Ibid., pp. 582-83.

FEELING THE WILL OF ANIMALS THROUGH INTROSPECTION If Schopenhauer felt we must \"make conjectures\" to arrive at a theory of animal consciousness,he was certain that we could identify and, hopefully, identify with, the \"heart,\" or will, of animals.\"*^ He claimed that \"what distinguishes the one [human] from the other [animal] is not to be found in the primary and original principle, in the archaeus, in the inner nature, in the kemel of the two [the Will] .. . but only in the secondary .. . in the degree of the cognitive faculty.\"^^ Because Schopenhauer felt that humans and animals contained the same \"kemel,\" humatiity could know animals by knowing their own inner nature. One of the most remarkable claims of Schopenhauer's philosophy is that we, to a degree and without perfection, can know the inner nature of the universe by \"immediately and intimately\" knowing the inner workings of our own body. Scho- penhauer claimed he could do so \"because my body is the only object of which I know not merely the one side, that of the representation, but also the other, that is called w///.\"^'* To avoid vulgarizing Schopenhauer's claim, he was careful to state that \"inward observation\" (i.e., introspection) cannot produce an \"exhaustive and adequate knowledge\" of the Will (both individual and, in tum, metaphysical).^^ Knowing one's own willing is \"only in its successive individual acts, not as a whole, in and by itself,\" and, thus, the Will can only be known \"imperfectly\" and will never appear completely \"naked .\"^^ However, \"the apprehension in which we know the stirrings and acts of our own Will is far more immediate than is any other.\"-^^ Once one recognizes the ceaseless inner drive, or, \"unquenchable thirst,\"^^ of their own will, the individual inductively recognizes that \"if all the other phenomena could be known by us just as immediately and intimately, we should be obliged to regard them precisely as that which the Will is in us.\"^' Schopenhauer defends this position by maintaining that undemeath the plurality seen in the world as rep- resentation , there is an undifferentiated thing-in-itself — a single Will, outside time and space and, thus, outside \"the possibility of plurality,\" making up the \"kernel\" of all phenomena.\"*\" Consequently, \"I must recognize the inscrutable forces that manifest themselves in all the bodies of nature as identical in kind with what in me is the Will, and as differing from it only in degree.'\"*' Therefore, when one discovers their own willing for self-preservation as a \"nar- row gateway to truth,\" one will know the \"real inner nature of things.'\"'^ This is 32 Ibid., p. 204. 3^ Schopenhauer, On the Basis of Morality, p. 178.

Fall 2013 ANIMAL EPISTEMOLOGY AND ETHICS 355 particularly explicit for knowing the inner nature of animals as \"essentially and in the main, we are the same as the animals.'\"*^ The following passage from the second volume of The World as Will and Representation summarizes the essence of what Schopenhauer's metaphysics can offer the epistemic problems regarding human-animal intersubjectivity and, thus, is quoted in extenso. For amazingly varied as the innumerable species of animals may be, and strange as some new form of them, never previously seen, may appear to us, we nevertheless assume beforehand with certainty its innermost nature as something well known, and indeed wholly familiar to us. Thus we know that the animal wills, indeed even what it wills, namely existence, well-being, life, and propagation. Since we here presuppose with perfect certainty an identity with ourselves, we have no hesitation in attributing to it unchanged all the affections of will known to us in ourselves; and we speak positively and plainly of its desire, aversion, fear, anger, hatred, love, joy, sorrow, longing, and so on. .. . Directly from our owti nature we understand all the actions and attitudes of animals that express stirrings and agitations of the will; and so to this extent we sympathize with them in many different Thus, in opposition to one-sided objective, positivistic positions, Schopenhauer's position is introspective, inductive, immediately known, and, to a large extent, subjectively formulated. This position may strike some as an invitation to fanati- cal anthropomorphism (e.g., this animal wants this because / do); however, his position should not be taken as such. If one shares Schopenhauer's assumption (i.e., animals are essentially the same as humans) one could also justifiably claim Schopenhauer was zoomorphizing humans. Schopenhauer's argument simply as- serts that the fundamental needs and common sufferings of animals are rooted in the same Will's drive for affirmation as our own. That is, the phenomenal \"actions and attitudes of animals\" are objectifications of the Will's \"stirrings and agitations,\" just as they are for humans. Unfortunately, Schopenhauer did not explain how, or whether it was even pos- sible , to introspecti vely grasp ( 1 ) what particular species specifically want (let alone individual members of a species) or (2) what these particular species would want in particular conditions.''^ Schopenhauer's oversights could likely be corrected by incorporating knowledge from animal behavioral sciences. However,knowing that a battery hen likely desires space to move around, for example, is qualitatively dif- ferent from introspectively/ee/wg what it would be like to be denied this longing, or, finally having the freedom to affirm it!''* But the latter intuitional experiences are achievable, valid, and meaningful only if we, at least to some degree, share Schopenhauer's metaphysical speculations. Although in need of further develop- ment, Schopenhauer's introspective methodology was moving in the right direction \"3 Ibid., p. 482. '\"Ibid.,p. 204. ''^ I would like to thank an anonymous Environmental Ethics referee for problematizing this significant gap in Schopenhauer's epistemology. '\" This intimate knowledge also has qualitatively different moral implications (see sec. 5). 356 ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS Vol. 35 in that it attempts io fuse the knower with the known through corporal intercon- nection and identification, rather than abstractly, dispassionately, and impartially comprehending another's state. There is a peculiarity in writing an abstract account about the immediate knowl- edge of our communion with animals: for Schopenhauer, identifying one's own inner nature with the other is something everyone feels and knows intuitively,''^ This intuitive knowledge is especially apparent in the \"immediate and certain truth that is self-evident to everyone\" that \"animals are in all essential respects identi- cal with us.\"^^ However, Schopenhauer argued that the union we should be able to intuitively feel with animals has been distorted and forgotten—particularly in Westem societies where \"he [humanity] hardens his heart against that identity of being between them [animals] and himself,'\"\" IV, JUDEO-CHRISTIAN THOUGHT AND OUR BOND WITH ANIMALS As stated above, Schopenhauer was irritated by many philosophers for their ignorance of animals. However, he felt that the Western world's philosophical \"barbarism\" toward animals started long before the nineteenth century—originat- ing with Judaism (an ideational thesis famously echoed by Lynn White, Jr. over a century later) ,^\" In his formulation of compassion as the basis of morality (see below), Schopenhauer stated that in other philosophical systems animals \"are said to have no rights, and there is the erroneous idea that our behavior to them is with- out moral significance, , , , All this is revoltingly crude, a barbarism of the West, the source of which is to be found in Judaism,\"^' Schopenhauer claimed when we left the ancient \"tme\" religions of the East (i,e,, Hinduism and Buddhism), \"man, in this Westem Hemisphere ,, , no longer recognizes animals as his brethren, and '\" Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, vol, 1, p, 368, \"\" Schopenhauer, Parerga and Paralipomena, vol, 2, p, 376, •\" Schopenhauer, \"On the Fourfold Root of the Principle Sufficient Reason,\" p, 115, Cf, Sigmund Freud, \"One of the Difficulties of Psycho-Analysis,\"/nte™aí/ona/yo«rna/o/Pí3;c/¡o-Ana/>'.sú'l (1920): 17, Unfortunately, Schopenhauer never confronts a contradiction in his theorizing. He acknowledges that our understandings of and emotional connections with animals are socially mediated. Specifically in his philosophy. Western relations with animals have been distorted by a widespread internalized Judeo-Christian worldview. To what extent does this mediatedness conceal the essence of animals and our ability to negate humanity's deformed relations with and understandings of animals? Is a bodily introspection potent enough to penetrate reified walls? If it is, who has immediate epistemic access to the inner strivings of animals, and under what conditions, if our knowledge is socially mediated!

This topic is dealt with in length, and quite maliciously,^^ in the second volume of Parer ga and Paralipomena. [Christianity] now tries to accept man entirely by himself and regards animals positively as things.... [T]he Creator (Genesis 1 and 9) hands over to man all the animals, just as if they were mere things and without any recommendation to their being properly treated. . . . The Creator hands them over so that man may rule over them and thus may do what he likes with them. . . . The fault lies with the Jewish view that regards the animal as something manufactured for man's use. . . . [L]ook at the revolting and outrageous wickedness with which our Christian mob treats animals, laughing as they kill them without aim or object, maiming and torturing them.... It might truly be said that men are the devils of this earth and animals the tortured souls.''* Schopenhauer not only tied the Judeo-Christian reification of animals to general \"mob\" cruelty, but also to vivisection, the lack of protection for animals in Eu- rope,^^ and the \"priestly trick\" of creating disparate words for animal functions to separate them from human functions.^« Further, he felt the presumptions from Judeo-Christian theology were adopted by Westem philosophers, leading to a thoroughly anthropocentric philosophical heritage.^^ For example, Kant's \"revolt- ing and abominable\" position on human duties toward animals was said to be the result of Judeo-Christianity^^ and Spinoza's failure to extend rights to animals was condemned as \"thoroughly Jewish.\"^' Thus, Schopenhauer extended a reminder to his contemporaries that should also be extended to many philosophers today: \"We must remind the Western, Judaized despiser of animals and idolater of the faculty of reason that, just as he was suckled by his mother, so too was the dog by his.\"^ ^- Schopenhauer. \"On the Fourfold Root of the Principle Sufficient Reason,\" pp. 114-15. ^^ This is why Nietzsche claimed Schopenhauer liked to \"dress up his hatred for certain things and people as mercy for animals.\" The Gay Science (Vintage: New York, 1974), p. 155. However, this is only one aspect of Schopenhauer's insights into the Judeo-Christian tradition. Besides criticizing its exclusion of kindness to animals, he talked quite favorably about the teachings of the New Testament and considered its ethics akin to his own as it \"leads not only to the highest degrees of charity and human kindness, but also to renunciation [self-denial].\" Schopenhauer did not feel this way about the Old Testament's \"realism and optimism.\" See Schopenhauer, Parerga and Paralipomena, vol. 2, pp. 378-86, and The World as Will and Representation, vol. 1, p. 386. ^ Schopenhauer, Parerga and Paralipomena, vo\\. 2, p. 370-71. 55 Ibid., pp. 371-75. 5^ Schopenhauer, On the Basis of Morality, pp. 176—77. 5^ Ibid., pp. 175-76.

COMPASSION AS TRANSCENDENCE Although Schopenhauer felt practical philosophy was infantile and ought to be abandoned, there is undoubtedly a practical, moral outcome of recognizing that we have an \"identical\" \"inner nature\" as animals.*' In fact, it is problematic to analytically separate the introspective methodology of Schopenhauer from his compassionate ethics. The reason it is separated here is not only for hoped for clarity, but is also stmctured as such to signify the ideational break Schopenhauer felt Judeo-Christianity had placed between human and animal. Schopenhauer claimed compassion {Mitleid; literally, \"suffering with [another]\") to be the basis of all morally worthy actions.*^ In opposition to highly rational ethi- cal systems based on abstract aphorisms (or \"the hollow phrases, the brain-webs and soap bubbles of the schools\"), Schopenhauer took a \"humble path,\" founded on intuition and immediate and concrete knowledge: \"It contains no constmction a priori, no absolute legislation for all rational beings in abstracto .\"^-^ Schopenhauer's contextual and personal formulation of compassion is exceptional—both brilliant and unique—and deserves some consideration. For Schopenhauer, only disinterested actions (i .e,, actions free from egoism) were of moral worth ,^ Because Schopenhauer felt that suffering greatly outweighed pleasure in existence—in fact, the latter is said to be the momentary absence of the former^^—all sympathy is limited to identifying with suffering, as another's fortune \"leaves us unmoved,\"^^ Thus, compassion is described as suffering \"directly with\" another and feeling the other's woe \"as I ordinarily feel only my own,\"*^ Suffering with another leads to the desire for another's weal (essentially, the absence of pain) \"in the same way I otherwise desire only my own.\"^^ Schopenhauer outlines two morally virtuous actions that arise from compassion, one negative (in the sense '•' Schopenhauer, rae Worldas W/Wanc/Ae/jre.se/!/aííon, vol. 1, p. 271. Schopenhauer claimed practi- cal philosophy was futile because one cannot prescribe goodness, beauty, or truth through abstraction. For instance, \"no one ever became an artist by studying aesthetics\" and \"a noble character was never formed by a study of ethics.\" Thus, he concluded that all philosophy must be theoretical and contempla- tive. Ibid., p. 45.

Although this comment is consistent with Schopenhauer's tragic analysis of the human condition, he seems to contradict himself within the context of his views toward animals. Schopenhauer frequently expressed this positive form of sympathy, what Von Hartmann called \"sympathetic rejoicing,\" for animals (e.g., see this essay's opening quotation).

(1) Justice is not \"using another's suffering as a means to the attainment of my ends\" and is denoted by the maxim, \"injure no one.\"*' (2) Loving kindness (also described as àYa7rTi [agape]) is ego-less, active love to help another and is denoted by the maxim, \"help everyone as much as you can.\"^'' Both of Schopenhauer's \"cardinal virtues\" require that one \"denies himself pleasures, undergoes privations, in order to alleviate another's suffering\"—including the suffering of animals.^' Schopenhauer's notion of compassion is grounded in his metaphysics of the oneness of the Will.^^ Those who intuitively recognize this oneness undemeath the \"fleeting, deceptive phenomenon\" ultimately make \"less distinction than is usu- ally made between himself and others.\"^^ Thus, compassion is also described as a state when \"the non-ego has to a certain extent become the ego.\"^'' When another's non-ego becomes one's ego, one ... recognizes immediately, and without reasons or arguments, that the in-itself of his phenomenon is also that of others, namely that will-to-live which constitutes the in- ner nature of everything, and lives in all; in fact, he recognizes that this extends even to the animals and to the whole of nature; he will therefore not cause suffering even to an animal. . . . Himself, his will, he recognizes in every creature, and hence in the sufferer also.'' He declared that \"[b]oundless compassion for all living beings is the firmest and surest guarantee of pure moral conduct\" and claimed that his system's protection of animals provided further proof that his system was \"genuine.\"^* ^^ Ibid., pp. 148-62. ™ Ibid., pp. 162-67.

It is peculiar that Schopenhauer did not follow a vegetarian diet. He argued that in colder climates humans had to eat meat. Rather than an evasion of practicing vegetarianism, he seemed to genuinely believe that the \"unnatural\" European adoption of an animal food diet was a necessary evil.

After an ad hominem attack on Schopenhauer's character, Bertrand Russell remarked, \"It is hard to find in his life evidence of any virtue except kindness to animals, which he carried to the point of objecting to vivisection in the interests of science.\"^^ Schopenhauer not only railed against vivisection, but also supported societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals .'^^ As his ethical system was principally concerned with alleviating another's suffering, it is not surprising he focused on the suffering of animals, especially the \"tortures that are inflicted\" on the animal world by human society.^' Human cruelty toward the animal world angered Schopenhauer to the extent that the topic would structure his misanthropic tirades against humanity.^\" Schopenhauer was so sure that \"compassion for animals is so intimately associated with goodness of character\" that he claimed \"it may be confidently asserted that whoever is cruel to animals cannot be a good man.\"^' VI. CONCLUSIONS: REMEMBERING OUR BOND WITH ANIMALS Within Schopenhauer's pessimistic and tragic philosophy, he set aside a special place for animals. Not only did Schopenhauer show affection for other species, but also felt we could know much about them by knowing ourselves; as \"[a]bout himself everyone knows directly, about everything else only very indirectly.\"^^ His conclusions reside in his attempt to show that underneath appearances there is an absolute sameness of metaphysical substance that he called \"Will.\" This pri- mordial likeness is especially perceptible between humans and animals—a reality most philosophers of his time, the \"idolater[s] ofthe faculty of reason,\" refused to acknowledge.**^ That is, when gazing into the eyes of a suffering animal, one may confidently say, as Schopenhauer was fond of quoting, \"tat tvam asi,\" or, \"that art thou.\"^'* This is not an invitation to a postmodern. New Age pseudo-mysticism, but an appeal not to be reluctant in using \"heart\" in our relations with animals in a time when some think it is necessary to operationalize and quantify animal misery to know that they are, in fact, suffering.^^ This is not an attempt to abandon rationality \" Bertrand Russell,AHistory of Western Philosophy (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1945),p. 758.

Today, wherever one looks, \"he sees suffering humanity and the suffering animal world.\"^^ As for the immeasurable amount of sufferings animals experience under current conditions, there is nothing more crucial than Platonically remembering, as Schopenhauer would have it, our primordial, \"bodily\" language with our \"brethren,\" The billions of animals mutilated every year in the name of sustenance, fashion, entertainment, and science demand, indeed, \"boundless compassion,\" However, the Schopenhauerian task to \"take upon him- self the pain of the whole world\" cannot be an individual project as Schopenhauer had envisioned,^' The immensity of the undertaking is too great for the individual. Today, the realization of Schopenhauerian ethics can only take place in universal- ized and radicalized form,* Our current barbarous relations with the animal world demand a collective and resonant act of compassionate remembrance. ^' Stjepan G, Mestrovic, \"Rethinking the Will and Idea of Sociology in the Light of Schopenhauer's Philosophy,\" British Journal of Sociology 40, no, 2 (1989): 275, *' Wolfgang Schirmacher, \"The End of Metaphysics: What does this Mean?\" Social Science Informa- tion 23, no. 3 (\\9M):(ßl. *' Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, vol, 1, p, 379 (emphasis added), 89 Ibid, ^ See Von Hartmann, Philosophy of the Unconscious, vol, 3, for a universal vision of social renuncia- tion , Denial of particular pleasures (in context of our analysis, the desire for the flesh of others) would be necessary for a just, ethical, and ecologically sound social formation.
