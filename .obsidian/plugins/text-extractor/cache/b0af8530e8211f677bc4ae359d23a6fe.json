Tucker Bradford Paul Johnson SWO-275 2025-03-23 America is now viewing peak-auto through its rearview mirror. Environmental, social, and logistical issues are motivating Americans to abandon automobility in favor of more efﬁcient, clean, and socially responsible public transportation. (Enright. p665). As this trend continues, it is incumbent upon the city of Portland Maine's government, business leaders, and community members to continue to build and maintain systems and schedules of public transportation that do the most good for the most people, while simultaneously and speciﬁcally avoiding harm to underserved and high need constituent consumers. This article aims to propose and defend the creation of a free and equitable public transport system for Portland, to serve the values and interests of the majority of Portland's population Early Transportation Network in Portland, Maine In 1909, when Portland urban border extended from the Peninsula to Ocean Avenue, the city boasted a transportation system that ran hourly to destinations as far aﬁeld as South Windham, Old Orchard Beach, and Lewiston. Interestingly, the trolly system of this era was established and maintained by the Grand Trunk Railroad, a British North American [Canadain] company, and as with most transportation systems of the time, was intended to foster commerce in the North Eastern region of North America. All transport infrastructures condense social and political ideals. Mass urban transit in other words is always pursued for distinct purposes, and for the beneﬁt of some urban dwellers and to the detriment of others. (Enright. p666) It is startling to observe how sparse the population was in some of the areas serviced circa 1909. In this \"Birds Eye View\" we see that the lines extending out of the urban region of Portland are populated by only a few homes. This illustrates the contemporary social justice agendas of that era. In 1909, farming and agriculture in 1 Maine were predominantly, family operated and lower income families tended to live and work in the urban center. Fig 1. Reﬂecting on the story being told by this transportation illustration (Fig 1.), it is clear that the \"exemplary public good,\" (Enright. p667) that these systems served aligned with connecting agricultural products and tourist destinations to consumers and tourists, and not, speciﬁcally, towards promoting social equity and justice. 2 21st Century Portland Transport An economic appeal Mass transit systems are imbricated in fundamental questions about who belongs in the city, who is allowed to participate fully in urban activities, who decides how space will be planned and produced, and who gains from urban transformation (Enright p666) As we enter this post-auto-mobility era, it is crucial that we consider what impact our lower and middle-income population has had and will have on the economic, tourism, and cultural successes of Portland. Without a thriving working class, businesses of Portland may face a labor shortage, and increasing salaries, as lower and middle income families struggle to access employment within a reasonable commute from their homes. Further, it is important to consider the value that artists, musicians, street vendors, and other creatives bring to our city's success. As those populations ﬁnd it increasingly difﬁcult to ﬁnd affordable housing within walking distance of the centers of commerce, we must endeavor to prioritize their access and sense of belonging to this community, lest they seek to ﬁnd that belonging in more deserving communities. A social justice appeal [Transit-led urbanism] also has the potential to entrench existing hierarchies and to create new forms of urban marginality, inequality, and exclusion. Transit can be a vector of progressive change, or it can threaten bodily integrity, drive uneven development, segregate populations, ‘splinter’ urban space (Graham and Marvin 2001), reduce democratic inﬂuence, contribute to environmental injustice, and replicate and generate oppressive social relations. (Enright. p666) 3 Fig 2. Fig 2. shows Portland's transportation map, overlayed with the Red (\"Hazardous\") and Yellow (\"Deﬁnitely Declining\") zones from the 1935 City of Portland \"Redline Map.\" It is remarkable to see how, in all cases except where access to \"Best\" and \"Still Desirable\" zones demand, the Red zones and Yellow zones seem to be circumvented completely. With affordable housing on the peninsula all but out of reach for low and middle income families and individuals, access to employment, services, entertainment, and in fact, belonging are, by intention or oversight, functionally inhibited for these populations. Further, this overlay, while useful in describing the service area does not address the scheduling or cardinality of travel for these lines. For example, a Casco Bay High School student, living on Washington Ave can take a quick 20 minute ride to school on the 9B in the morning, but must take a 45 minute ride on the 9A on the way home, if they are not able to walk for 15 minutes. For a student with a disability, this is an enormous burden. Note on the overlay transportation map, how the 9A/B lines serve largely \"Deﬁnitely Declining,\" communities. For a community to champion values such as desegregation, equality, inclusion, bodily autonomy, and justice, it must ensure that the fundamental access for a people to the services and affordances of that community are equally available to all. A fair, free, and just public transportation system providing access to and from all parts of the 4 community is within reach, and absolutely necessary if Portland is to embody these values. The Transport Good Deﬁnition For the purpose of simplicity and consistency with other texts, the product that we will be optimizing will be referred to as the \"Transport Good\"–\"Good\" in this context meaning a product or service, rather than a moral good—(Martins. pp2-8). Optimization of the Transport Good In order for our public transportation system to equitably and justly serve our community, we must ﬁrst agree on what justice and equity mean in this context. Whether one wishes to optimize the Transport Good for social beneﬁt (e.g. ideal person accessibility) (Martins. p6), or seeks to optimize for economic beneﬁt, some outcomes will remain constant. This paper limits its focus to those areas of overlapping beneﬁt. If Portland wishes to maintain its reputation as a small, relaxed seaside city, we must ensure that the working people of the city continue to have relaxed, well supported lives, so that ease will be naturally apparent when they interface with the visiting population. Freedom of choice and potential mobility are strongly intertwined—with a high level of potential mobility implying a high level of choice in terms of employment opportunities, health care services, leisure facilities, and so forth. Portland is currently an unfriendly city to the automobile commuter. With an overabundance of 2 hour (or less) parking in the downtown area, there are precious few available day-long parking spots for retail workers. With 1 bedroom rents in the downtown area largely out of reach for retail income earners, this presents a signiﬁcant obstacle for business owners in the area. How can employees working for low hourly rates even afford to get to work? This paucity of available, day-long parking, combined with the aforementioned socioeconomic beneﬁt begs the question whether public transportation belongs in its on distributive sphere of social justice. That is to say, should transportation be refactored as a public service like parks, waste management and sanitation, street cleaning, education, and environmental protection. 5 In his paper\"Justice in transport as justice in accessibility:\" Martens explains how goods (such as transport) \"with distinct social meanings\" should be distributed \"solely on the basis of criteria that are relevant for those goods.\" (p15) According to Walzer, \"A distributive sphere should guarantee that the distribution of the particular good is autonomous from the way in which other goods are distributed. According to Walzer, injustice occurs if spheres are not autonomous. In that case, the distribution of one good or one set of goods can become dominant and determine the distributions in all, or many, spheres of distribution. Typically, according to Walzer, money and power are the goods to claim dominance, and much of the policy debates, like those in the ﬁelds of basic education or health services, are about limiting their domination. (Martins. p3) To summarize, Martens (via Walzer) is suggesting that allowing free market economics to govern the management of a social good like transportation, is inherently unjust and will ultimately lead to diminishing the beneﬁts that that good is meant to provide for society. Summary Having established the social and economic value of a fair and just public transportation system, the remaining question is how might social workers implement a system to maximize the public beneﬁt. It is clear from the cited research that a Transport Good should not be administered under the same economic system and rules that govern the distribution of other goods, lest those systems corrupt the beneﬁts that the Transport Good seeks to provide. Goods to which a particular society ascribes a distinct social meaning, in contrast, are to be taken out of the sphere of free exchange. Typical examples in modern Western societies are health and education. These and comparable goods, Walzer argues, ‘deserve’ their own distributive sphere. (Martins. p3) A free public transport system in Portland could engender the social, economic and even environmental outcomes that serve the myriad values of Portland residents, visitors and business owners hold. By removing capitalist drivers, social workers and city administrators would be empowered to focus on delivery of service to lower and middle income regions, improve the infrastructure—perhaps reintroducing an electric 6 trolly system, powered by local solar ﬁelds—and refactor scheduling and ordinality of routes, so that students, retail/service workers, and tourists, have swift, reliable, and low emission service to their destinations of choice. The ﬁeld of public mobility offers an incredibly fertile ground for social workers to empower their communities and create a deﬁnitive social beneﬁt, without coming into conﬂict with economic or political obstacles that plague some other social welfare programs. 7 Bibliography Birds Eye View showing Portland R.R.
