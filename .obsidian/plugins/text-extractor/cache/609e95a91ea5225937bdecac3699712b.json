Take note that the total of the frequency column is 82. The 7 by 2 table below presents the same data as a Relative Frequency Distribution. We use the data in the first table to construct the second table. Age (years) of Best Actor when Oscar was won Frequency 20 - 29 1 30 - 39 26 40 - 49 35 50 - 59 13 60 - 69 6 70 - 79 1 Age (years) of Best Actor when Oscar was won Relative Frequency 20 - 29 1.2% 30 - 39 31.7% 40 - 49 42.7% 50 - 59 15.9% 60 - 69 7.3% 70 - 79 1.2% Page of 1 6 As noted above, the total frequency is 82. 1 actor out of 82 is in the first interval (20 - 29) 1/82 = 0.012 = 1.2% 26 actors out of 82 are in the second interval (30 – 39) 26/82 = 0.317 = 31.7% And so on, as recorded in the above Relative Frequency Distribution table. Page of 2 6 The 7 by 2 table below presents the data as a Cumulative Frequency Distribution. Referring to the first table, the Frequency Distribution Table, you accumulate (add) as you go: 1 actor is less than 30 years old. That 1, plus the next 26, are less than 40 years old. Those 27, plus the next 35, are less than 50 years old. And so on, as shown in the Cumulative Frequency Distribution Table. Referring to the Frequency Distribution Table, (the table we began with) we construct a histogram. A histogram is a column graph, based on a Frequency Distribution Table. The y-axis (vertical) references the frequencies, and the x-axis (horizontal) references the intervals. The x-axis is labeled with the mid-points of the intervals. Age (years) of Best Actor when Oscar was won Cumulative Frequency Less than 30 1 Less than 40 27 Less than 50 62 Less than 60 75 Less than 70 81 Less than 80 82 Page of 3 6 Count of Best Actor Oscar Winners by Age 0 10 20 30 4024.534.544.554.564.574.5 The ﬁrst interval goes from 20 to 29. To ﬁnd the mid-point we add the endpoints of the interval and divide the result by 2: 20 + 29 = 49 49/2 = 24.5 For the second interval: 30 + 39 = 69 69/2 = 34.5 and so on . . . Here is an example based on student grade data: What follows are three, 6 by 2 tables. As in the “Oscar Winners” example, the same data is presented in four formats: Frequency Distribution Table Relative Frequency Distribution Table Cumulative Frequency Distribution Table. Histogram Frequency Distribution Table Relative Frequency Distribution Table Grade Frequency 50-59 1 60-69 2 70-79 10 80-89 8 90-99 4 Grade Relative Frequency 50 - 59 4.0% 60 – 69 8.0% 70 – 79 40.0% 80 – 89 32.0% 90 - 99 16.0% Page of 4 6 Cumulative Frequency Distribution Table Histogram On the quiz you will be given a frequency distribution table and you will need to represent that data in the other three formats: Relative Frequency Distribution Table Grade Cumulative Frequency Less than 60 1 Less than 70 3 Less than 80 13 Less than 90 21 Less than 100 25 Count of Students by Grade 0 3 5 8 1054.564.574.584.594.5 Page of 5 6 Cumulative Frequency Distribution Table.
