{"path":"2025/Fall/ECO-101 - Introduction to Macroeconomics/Attachments/Macro Fall 2025 Online Syllabus.pdf","text":"1 ECO 101-0004 Introductory Macroeconomics Michael Cote Fall 2025 Online mcote62@maine.edu Course Description Macroeconomics provides direction regarding how an economy can and should be managed. Given the enormity and complexity of the question it is necessary that simplifying models be created that hold constant certain assumptions. Therein lies the rub. How one defines reality very much depends upon how one chooses to frame the question. And how one chooses to frame the question depends very much upon the assumptions one chooses to adopt. The purpose of this course is not to “teach” you how to define your assumptions but, rather, to understand the consequences of given sets of assumptions. For example, given a choice between two “bads” such as higher inflation or higher unemployment, which would you prefer to conquer knowing that in doing so you make the other worse. As you will come to realize there are perfectly valid yet opposing theoretical models that describe how an economy functions and what should be done to correct imperfections and inform difficult questions like the one just posed. The ultimate objective of this course is to help move the student to a position in which s/he can make informed decisions about creating the world we share. Instructional Objectives Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to: 1. Describe different interpretations about how a macro economy works and predict the economic and social consequences of given policy choices. 2. Describe aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS). Students will be able to identify what market and interventions cause changes in AD & AS and explain how these changes will cause changes in the business cycle that lead to economic growth or stagnation and why in some circumstances this is welcome and in others why it is not. 3. Analyze and explain the relationships among unemployment, inflation and economic growth. Students consider the cost and benefits of fighting inflation or recessions understanding that fixing one comes at the cost of making the other worse. Moreover, students will be able to predict how these short-run interventions may affect long-run economic growth. 4. Describe government intervention vis-à-vis stabilization policy (fiscal policy). Students will analyze why some fiscal policy interventions are more powerful than others while other policy interventions may be more popular. 5. Describe Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) intervention vis-à-vis stabilization policy (monetary policy). Understanding that the Fed has three basic tool raises the question of which tool to use and why. Students will analyze and predict the choice of tools, or, alternatively, when the Fed should not intervene. 6. Describe how the international economy works. Students will explore why the vast majority of economists, both conservative and liberal, favor free trade while discovering the limits and adverse consequences that must be accounted for. Students will also analyze how exchange rates change and how these changes affect consumers and producers in both countries. They will also explore why some countries allow their currency to float while other countries fix their exchange rate and analyze the costs and benefits of both exchange rate regimes. 2 Text Krugman/Wells, Macroeconomics 7th Edition. (MacMillian/Worth Publishers), 2024. Students who are able to obtain the 6th Edition are welcome to use it, however, everyone must have a text by the first day of class. Additional Learning Aids For most chapters, there are video lectures that I have recorded. These video presentations are required because choosing not to watch to them amounts to skipping class. The elaborations contained in these videos are fodder for exam questions. For each chapter in the book the student will also find supplemental learning aids intended to provide depth to the readings. These learning aids may take the form of short videos from outside sources such as Khan Academy, or handouts prepared by the instructor. It is highly recommended that students watch these videos so that they will gain an appreciation of the material by viewing it through another lens. Technical Requirements There will be NO extensions or retakes allowed unless extraordinary circumstances are presented to the instructor because doing so requires that other students must wait for their results. It is REQUIRED of online students that they possess the technical ability and resources/equipment (hardware/software) necessary for online learning. If your internet connection is unreliable, you have the possible option of using a computer lab at a nearby college or any public library. You will have the opportunity to discover the reliability of your connection in a low impact manner when you take the quizzes and join in discussions. If you opt to take an exam at an “untested” connection and find that you lose your connection that is your choice. Student Grading and Criteria for Evaluating Student Performance 10 Quizzes: 20% The lowest two grades will be dropped. 10 Discussion Boards 20% The lowest two grades will be dropped. Midterm Exam 1 20% Midterm Exam 2 20% Final Exam 20% The quizzes consist of 10 multiple choice questions drawn from the publisher’s pool of questions. You will have three opportunities to take each quiz and the highest grade is the one that counts. You will have 60 minutes to complete the total of all three attempts. In other words, once you open a quiz you may close it and re-open and take it up to three times but the timer never stops once the quiz has been originally opened. Be aware that since the questions are drawn from a pool each iteration of the quiz will likely have different questions. Also, be aware that the correct answers for those questions you answered incorrectly will not be available until the deadline for taking the quiz has expired. However, when you review each iteration of the quiz, you will be aware which questions you answered incorrectly. 3 Discussions generally consist of two parts: an initial post and a response. If a response is required and a student only makes an additional post they will only earn half credit. Details regarding length of posts are subject to change depending upon the topic. However, a good rule of thumb is that an initial post should be about 200 words and a reply about 100 words. You will not have access to others’ posts until you make your initial post. Initial posts are due by 11:59pm on the date due and replies are due by 11:59pm on the date due. In order to receive full credit, you must complete both parts of the assignment by the deadlines. Moreover, posts that are disrespectful will be awarded a grade of zero. Please see the Netiquette guidelines posted on Brightspace. The exams will consist of an array of question types—short answer, multiple choice, short essay, etc. You will have 3 hours to complete an exam and unlike the quizzes the exams can only be taken once. Once the timer begins you have 180 minutes to complete the exam. If you are knocked off-line or leave the exam for any reason, you may return, however the clock has continued to run, so make sure to save as you go along. Please note that I generally allow 2 hours for exams, but I have extended them an hour in case you get bumped off-line. Personal Commitment In keeping with University understanding, plan to commit a minimum average of 9 hours per week for any 3-credit course, including classes taken on-line. Nothing will subvert an online learner more than inadequate time management. Schedule blocks of time—learning on the fly will not work. Class Policies • Cheating: Students caught cheating will be assigned a grade of F for the course and the matter will be turned over to the Student Conduct Committee for disciplinary action. If a student goes to the internet for answers on an exam s/he has cheated. Please bear in mind that the instructor also knows how to use the internet. The idea is to use the materials provided by the instructor because they are more than sufficient to prepare the student for an exam. Moreover, using the internet to supplement one’s learning is not a very good idea. Use the materials provided and if you have questions post them to the HELP ME discussion board. • Incomplete Policy: An incomplete will only be given to students in extreme situations. The student must be passing the course to qualify for an incomplete. • Withdrawal: The possibility of failing the class is not sufficient reason for withdrawal after the standard withdrawal date. • L grade: A grade of L will be assigned to students who do not turn in the final. Students can ask for an F if they would prefer, but the policy is to assign an L if no other arrangements are made. Schedule All assignments are due by 11:59pm on the date due.

Academic Integrity / Plagiarism Everyone associated with the University of Southern Maine is expected to adhere to the principles of academic integrity central to the academic function of the university. Any breach of academic integrity represents a serious offense. Each student has a responsibility to know the standards of conduct and expectations of academic integrity that apply to academic tasks. Violations of student academic integrity include any actions that attempt to promote or enhance the academic standing of any student by dishonest means. Cheating on an examination, stealing the words or ideas of another (i.e., plagiarism), making statements known to be false or misleading, falsifying the results of one's research, improperly using library materials or computer files, or altering or forging academic records are examples of violations of this policy which are contrary to the academic purposes for which the University exists. Acts that violate academic integrity disrupt the educational process and are not acceptable. Evidence of a violation of the academic integrity policy will normally result in disciplinary action. A copy of the complete policy may be obtained from the Dean of Students Office website at usm.maine.edu/community-standards-mediation/academic-integrity or by calling and requesting a copy at (207) 780-5242.

Netiquette Our text-based communication is vital in this course since it is the primary—and possibly only—way we will connect with each other. Please be careful and considerate in all your communications with each other and your instructor. The online medium is poor at conveying tone. Consider what you are saying and remember that your intent might not be inferred by your readers (fellow students and instructors). Take a moment to re-read everything you write: assume that it will be taken in the worst possible light. And extend courtesy to others: assume the most charitable light possible. Both of these steps will make communication easier and far more civil. Student Data Retention Your maine.edu account is issued to you for as long as you are a student of this or any other University of Maine System campus. There are various limits on how long IT can retain data you have stored through this account depending on which services you have used. Below are the major points, but we encourage you to visit accounts.maine.edu for full details on maine.edu account policies. Assignments and other work stored in Brightspace Do NOT leave important academic work in old Brightspace courses. Each semester, all courses receive a fresh Brightspace page commonly referred to as a “shell.” Course shells older than two years are automatically purged from the system, but sometimes instructors remove old course shells manually on their own. It is strongly recommended that you make backups of any work you have submitted to Brightspace before or shortly after your course ends. Especially if your program requires you to maintain a portfolio of work you have done. Google Products Your maine.edu account is also a fully functional Google Account with access to Gmail, Google Drive, and most of Google’s other products. After leaving the university, either through graduation or simply not registering for courses, credit-earning students have 5 years before their maine.edu account is removed. The limit is 2 years for non-credit students. This includes files and email stored in Google’s products using your maine.edu account. If this data is important to you, or if you need to retain it for a portfolio or future certification, you must make 8 and maintain your own personal backups of these files. Consider using Google Takeout (takeout.google.com) to backup this data prior to separating from the University. Box If you are using Box through your maine.edu account, please be aware that your storage can only be maintained for one year after you have graduated, or otherwise separated from the university.
