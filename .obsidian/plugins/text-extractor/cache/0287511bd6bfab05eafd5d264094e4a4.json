Email: RSaleem@lesley.edu Abstract Discrimination and vilification of Muslims in the United States have historical and political roots. This study ex- plores everyday incidents of marginalization and oppres- sion through the framework of structural violence. Structural violence refers to the systemic inequalities em- bedded within societal structures that create and support these oppressive conditions. In this community‐engaged qualitative study, 10 self‐identified Muslims from the northeastern United States were interviewed to under- stand their lived experiences of structural violence. Using thematic analysis, seven themes were identified: Racialized and xenophobic Islamophobia; normalized violence against Muslims and fear of safety; exclusion, marginalization, and subjugation through policies; Muslims as spokespersons for Islam; Intersecting marginalized identities and oppression; challenges of navigating Muslim identities; resilience and resistance through faith, activism, and community. This study aims to understand and contextualize the experi- ences of Muslims within a systemic and geopolitical fra- mework. Another critical objective is to promote a discourse to address how academics and clinicians re- produce and maintain structural violence and to instead engage in socially transformative approaches embedded in the principles of decolonizing and mutually‐liberating cross‐struggle solidarity. These must be cultivated through community‐informed intersectional collaborative strategies for dismantling oppressive structures and pro- moting agency, resilience, activism, and resistance. KEYWOR DS intersectionality, islamophobia, oppression, resistance, violence, xenophobia 1 | INTRODUCTION Significant research documents the impact of marginalization, powerlessness, and oppression on individual well‐ being (Albee, 1986; Awad et al., 2019; Farmer, 2003). Examining oppressive conditions through the lens of systemic “marginalization, exclusion and exploitation along lines of “race,” class, gender, ethnicity, nationality, and other invidious categories” (Dutta et al., 2016, p. 2) reveals the structural foundations of oppressive inequalities. Despite these findings, there has been a disconnect between traditional Western frameworks of mental health and a contextual and nuanced integration of the impact of the sociopolitical realities on the everyday experiences of marginalized communities (DeLoach & Swaroop, 2014). This is manifested by reductive conceptualizations that pathologize and individualize distress faced by members of disenfranchised communities and offer manualized, individually‐focused diagnoses and treatment with little to no emphasis on addressing its social and political contributors. Therefore, there is a critical need for developing sociopolitical frameworks to shape structural emancipatory solutions that focus on dismantling oppression. In this study, we hope to address this disconnect by examining the impact of structural violence on the well‐being of Muslims. In addition to ongoing geopolitical systemic realities, the 2016 United States presidential election has exacerbated the negative impact on different minority groups (Garrison et al., 2018), particularly Muslims. We situate contemporary Islamophobia in the nor- malization (i.e., process whereby behavior or ideas are made to seem normal through ideology or propaganda) of systemic and structural oppression and contextualize it within its historical and political roots. 1.1 | Structural violence Structural violence refers to the violence embedded in societal systems and structures that play a foundational role in creating, maintaining, and supporting inequality, exclusion, and other oppressive conditions through institutional policies and other sociopolitical systems and structures (e.g., legal, educational, health, economic, and political). Although the term structural violence can be attributed to Galtung (1969), others have also discussed how systems and structures discriminate and inflict violence that is based on social identity categories, such as class, gender, race, and ethnicity (Farmer, 2003; Martín‐Baró,1996). Through the exploitation of these and other marginalized social identities, inequality, and injustice are incorporated into institutional policies and systems. The framework of structural violence links individual incidents of direct and indirect violence to patterns of persistent and harmful systemic and institutional inequalities and injustices. Examining incidents of structural violence inflicted on marginalized communities illuminates the connections between apparent individual instances of injustice and the broader pattern of oppression. Furthermore, this approach facilitates an intersectional analysis that connects these patterns across communities and promotes inter‐solidarity praxis. Structural violence also refers to the inequalities perpetuated by institutions, even if these practices are considered “legal” (Pool & Geissler, 2005). Galtung (1969) describes structural violence as a form of unequal power and opportunity to access various societal resources and systems. These include medical services, education, employment and income (Yearby, 2018). Within the United States, large bodies of research have identified how those with marginalized SALEEM ET AL. | 427 identities experience health inequalities due to their gender, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity (Krieger et al., 2014; Read & Gorman, 2010; Reisner et al., 2016; Williams & Mohammed, 2009). Structural violence and inequalities impact an individual's sense of humanity, belonging, well‐being, dignity, and self‐worth (Dutta et al., 2016; Quesada et al., 2011). 1.2 | Islamophobia Islamophobia is defined as an intense dislike, hatred, hostility, discrimination, prejudice, and aversion to or fear of Islam and Muslims (Abu‐Ras et al., 2018; Runnymede Trust, 1997). Although the rise of Islamophobic attitudes and behaviors towards Muslims is often associated with the events of 9/11, its presence in Western societies can be dated to as early as 1920 (Cesari, 2006; Kumar, 2012). Scholars from a diverse range of disciplines have discussed its historical and political connection to colonialism and imperialism (Kumar, 2012; Said, 1978). Islamophobia in the West has been cultivated and perpetuated by a wide range of political persuasions, from the far right to liberals and leftists, and is connected to different geopolitical agendas (Kumar, 2012; Toor, 2012), e.g., Western foreign and military interventions in Muslim countries (Chomsky, 2015; Said, 1978). The past three decades have been characterized by an increasingly negative portrayal of Islam in the media (Shadid & van Koningsveld, 2002). Al- though United States laws and policies have long reflected a general distrust of Muslims, these have dramatically intensified since 9/11 and the resulting so‐called war on terror (Akram, 2002; Samari, 2016) with the Muslim community being labeled a “suspect community” (Cherney & Murphy, 2016). These laws and policies have resulted in surveillance, torture, detentions, and deportations (ACLU, 2006). The increase in discrimination, marginalization, and hate crimes against Muslims has paralleled the “war on terror,” with implementation of policies that have created a “climate of fear” within the Muslim community (Akram, 2002, p. 62). These policies have been justified by using stereotypes and vilified caricatures of the religion, depicting all Muslims as terrorists and violent extremists (Ahmed & Matthes, 2017; Alsultany, 2014). These negative portrayals are perpetuated by Western officials (e.g., politicians) and by cultural venues (e.g., media), resulting in pernicious perceptions and harm, such as Muslims being less accepted than other immigrants (Doebler, 2014). This othering and negative portrayal of Muslims has been theorized to have had a variety of consequences, including harsher sentences in legal cases (Ahmed, 2016), being targeted for practicing Islam that is supposed to be protected by the United States Constitution (Council on American Islamic Relations, 2007; Lichtblau, 2016), being denied fair access through United States borders, and a greater likelihood to have criminal acts be labeled as terrorism (Wofsy, 2017). 2 | PURPOSE O F STUDY Given the detrimental impact of Islamophobia and structural violence on Muslims, this study intended to explore and contextualize their lived experiences. Galtung (1969) theorized that due to its diffuse and pervasive nature, structural violence is not attributable to one single institution but is made most visible through the everyday experiences of people targeted. Documenting these stories is critical as scholars have noted the role of structural violence in erasing and obscuring collective histories (Farmer, 2003). Thus, there is an urgent need to witness and document Muslims' experiences and voices that are often absent or silenced, toward developing culturally in- formed research about the Muslim community (Amer & Bagasra, 2013; Hodge et al., 2015) to develop appropriate strategies to address oppressive social structures and policies. It is crucial to de‐ideologize harmful discourses and interrupt practices and policies that perpetuate systemic violence. Critical qualitative inquiry can be particularly useful in both bearing witness to and illustrating lived experiences of social phenomena rooted in the analysis of a wider complex context which can mitigate the risk of these narratives being subsumed by hegemonic epis- temologies (Fine, 2007; Prasad, 2015). This study examined the impact of structural violence on Muslims in the 428 | SALEEM ET AL. northeastern United States, utilizing thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) and community‐engaged methods. The objectives of this study are to investigate: (1) the impact of structural violence on the lived experiences of Muslims in America; (2) the ways in which these experiences interact with individuals' intersecting identities; (3) the ways that individuals and communities actively respond to structural violence, including coping mechanisms, resilience, and resistance. 3 | METHODS 3.1 | Participants Participant recruitment was conducted through purposive and snowball sampling, a method utilized to engage research with vulnerable, stigmatized, or difficult‐to‐reach communities (Atkinson & Flint, 2001). The research team was comprised of a faculty member as the primary investigator and six doctoral students in a Counseling Psychology program. The team consisted of individuals with varying ages, gender identities, and racial‐ethnic backgrounds, including South Asian, Latinx, and White. Two of the researchers (the faculty member and one doctoral student) were raised in Muslim families. Researchers engaged in explicit conversations about their in- tersecting identities to explore its potential impact on their perspectives and biases. In addition, throughout the entire research process, research members engaged in journaling and memoing as a reflexivity practice that allowed for individual exploration and reflection of personal biases. During the process of coding, coding pairs explored how each person's identity may shape their coding process. When the larger team compared codes and discussed differences in coding, a particular focus on prioritizing the input of research team members with greatest proximity to the phenomenon was practiced. This proximity varied but could include research members with similar identities and experiences or research members who were most closely immersed in the data, for example, by having conducted the interview. The research members initiated and developed partnerships with key informants in the northeastern United States either through their pre‐existing connections to the Muslim community or through contacting through email correspondence and in‐person visits with the community leaders and by disseminating flyers, in English, across Muslim networks (e.g., community centers within predominantly Muslim communities, mosques, Islamic centers, housing developments). The key community leaders introduced research team members to several other potential participants. Through their connections, research team members were invited to attend several community meetings and events, during which they were encouraged to advertise and discuss the study with potential participants. During these introductions and discussions for recruitment, in addition to English, two of the research members spoke with the community members in their respective languages of Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi. Thus, while all interviews were conducted in English, the expectation of being able to speak English was not an inclusion criterion. Community leaders and participants referred other potential participants by contacting them and pro- viding them with the researchers' contact information. This combination of community‐engaged and purposive and snowball sampling facilitated access within a difficult‐to‐reach population and allowed for the formation of trusting relationships across community members and researchers (Atkinson & Flint, 2001). A total of 10 participants, of whom eight identified as heterosexual cisgender females and two as heterosexual cisgender males, from diverse ethnic‐racial, linguistic, national, and socioeconomic backgrounds (see Table 1) were recruited and participated in nine one‐hour interviews conducted and transcribed in English and coded by researchers. Inclusion criteria in- volved being 18 years of age or older, English speaking, and self‐identifying as “a member of a Muslim community.” Two participants, who were a married couple, requested to be interviewed jointly about their shared experiences of structural violence. During regular bi‐monthly meetings, the researchers discussed prior knowledge of structural violence to manage undue influence of prior perspectives such that data were grounded in participants' experiences.

Individuals who ex- pressed interest in participating were provided with a document detailing the voluntary nature of the study and asking for both: (a) their consent to participation, and (b) permission to record and transcribe a deidentified version of their interview. In‐person or online video interviews, or telephone interviews were then scheduled based upon participants' preferences and availability. At the beginning of each interview, participants were asked to fill out a sociodemographic form. Interviews were semi‐structured and audio recorded. All interviews were conducted in English by the research team members. Interview questions were reviewed alongside community leaders during the recruitment process to ensure their sensitivity and adequacy. Semi‐structured interview questions were developed before engaging in interviews and were created with input from the whole team. Interview questions were designed to include discussion of ex- periences within various systemic structures and institutions, for example, medical, legal, professional, educational (see Appendix). In particular, the team focused on creating open ended questions that allowed participants to share what was most relevant to them. The semi‐structured nature of the interviews allowed for the inclusion of additional, more individualized follow‐up questions about participants' unique experiences. Credibility questions were also included at the completion of the interview to obtain feedback from participants about their experience of being interviewed and to assess for validity. The participants included in this study represent a purposive and snowball sample of 10 diverse individuals who identified as Muslim and resided in the northeastern United States (see Table 1). As a stipend for their time, participants received $35 at the end of each interview. Several precautions were taken to ensure participant privacy and safety. All data (i.e., forms, audio recordings, transcriptions) were maintained under password pro- tection and deidentified. Data analysis: The data was analyzed using Braun and Clarke's (2006) methodology for thematic analysis. Thematic analysis is well‐positioned to identify themes and patterns of structural violence that were salient within and across interviews. Interviews were read numerous times throughout the transcribing process and then at least once more before the coding stage. During these readings, researchers engaged in personal memoing or journaling practices to increase immersion with the data. Then, research members coded each interview in teams of two for interrater reliability. Data analysis trainings were conducted within the research team by senior lab team members. The coding process involved reading each interview and then identifying basic meaningful “codes” that represented all content relevant to participants' experiences of structural violence, the research phenomenon. Fidelity to interviewees' experiences and language was maintained throughout the coding process. The initial codes provided the units of analysis. They were recorded and reviewed, across the teams of two, to achieve consensus and interrater reliability. Following this, each coding pair shared their research codes with the whole team. The interview was read once more collectively before this meeting and consensus about the featured codes was achieved as a team. When discrepancies arose, effort was taken to include all research team perspectives. How- ever, consulting the perspectives of the researcher who had conducted the interview and team members with greater proximity to the phenomenon was prioritized. Once the initial codes were finalized, themes that represented and captured patterns of meaning across these codes were identified by the primary researcher. Codes and themes emerged from the data to depict participants' experiences of structural violence rather than being identified a priori to fit within an already‐existing theory. However, as themes were identified and created, remaining codes were placed into already existing themes that were seen to best represent their meaning and commonality or relationship to other codes. Through this iterative process, another level of broader themes was developed, forming a hierarchy of (1) codes, (3) subthemes, and (4) themes. There were seven overarching themes that captured patterns and reconciled discrepancies across subthemes. Consistent with Braun and Clarke (2021) position on saturation in thematic analysis, this analysis focused upon generating meaning through interpretation rather than “excavation.” Therefore, while recognizing SALEEM ET AL. | 431 the situatedness and subjective nature of data collection and analysis, saturation, or “information redundancy,” meant to indicate a certainty or completeness in this study's depiction of the phenomenon was neither sought our nor identified. Rather, the findings and their contextual situatedness are discussed throughout their presentation. This qualitative analysis focused on understanding the depth and nuances (Fine, 2007; Prasad, 2015) to the phenomenon of structural violence, as experienced by the participants instead of seeking to document the pre- valence or breadth of experiences. As researchers approaching this topic with our own identities and biases, we placed importance on examining our positionality as scholars interested in identifying themes relevant to structural violence to acknowledge that themes do not emerge entirely objectively. Additionally, we have approached this study through a critical contextualist epistemology, viewing individual meaning‐making as a process that is related to social context, yet also maintains an essence of investigable “reality” (Braun & Clarke, 2006). 4 | RESULTS A total of seven overarching main themes were identified that articulate the lived experiences and impact of structural violence on Muslims in our sample. 4.1 | Theme one: Racialized and xenophobic islamophobia Participants discussed direct and indirect experiences of ongoing negative, inaccurate, and harmful rhetoric about Muslims within interpersonal and institutional contexts. These stereotypes, distortions, and misperceptions were embedded in insidious and overt racist and xenophobic attitudes. Participants experienced intensified fear with the escalation of Islamophobic and xenophobic rhetoric, particularly the portrayal of Muslims as dangerous and against the United States in the aftermath of 9/11 and the 2016 presidential election. This xenophobic Islamophobic rhetoric conveyed to them that they did not belong in the United States. In addition to the rhetoric by politicians and government officials, the significant role of the media was also noted in promulgating stereotypes of Muslims as dangerous, violent, terrorists, and as dehumanized outsiders. Many felt this was accomplished by portraying Muslims in the United States as an ethno‐racially monolithic group of immigrants and foreigners. Participants noted that these stereotypes were depicted subtly through double standards, for example, White perpetrators of violence are presented in the media as ordinary people, con- textualized within multifaceted lives and a complex range of relatable motivations and intentions including struggles with mental health. Their acts of violence were not viewed as reflecting or implicating all White people. However, in the case of Muslims, any act of violence was generalized to the entire Muslim community and misattributed as characteristic of their faith. Hafsa, an immigrant Muslim, described her perspective of this uni- dimensional and malevolent view: “They never saw Muslims giving in charity or creating social structures and programs that support people. They saw people labeled as Muslims killing people and blowing up things and that's what they thought.” Participants articulated that these inaccurate stereotypes were not exclusively about the Islamic faith, they also portray Muslims as phenotypically nonwhite and foreign. The participants in our sample experience raciali- zation of their religion through the ascribing “of racial meaning to a previously racially unclassified social re- lationship, social practice or group” (Omi & Winant, 1994, p. 111). Omar, a multiracial Muslim, described this by stating “Islamophobia is racialized,” referring to the ways in which he had been personally targeted and assaulted because he “looked” Muslim as he had darker physical features. Across interviews, horror and fear were voiced by participants in response to the surge of racist and xenophobic Islamophobia during the 2016 presidential election cycle. Ayesha, a Black Muslim, contextualized her experience of Islamophobia within the larger context of racism in the United States: 432 | SALEEM ET AL. When I found out, that the person who says all these really bad things about Muslims won (the Presidential election) I was sad, of course. I wasn't really much in disbelief, but I think I was angry—I was angry not just because he won but because you have Black people who've lived in this country for hundreds and hundreds of years, who have been telling you that there's something wrong with the system. We've been yelling, crying, screaming, all types of things all of our lives, and it never really affected much of anyone else. We were always at the bottom, right? Now, everyone is realizing that it's a possibility that they could become us. It's scary. And it's like: this has been a reality. 4.2 | Theme two: Normalized violence against Muslims and fear for safety All participants described experiences of violence in the form of individual harassment or discrimination. This harassment was rooted in the ethnic, religious, and cultural stereotypes of Muslims reinforced by various struc- tures and societal institutions. For example, Omar described traumatic effects following his experience of physical violence at school: After 9/11 there was an incident that I had at school where a bunch of eighth graders beat me up and called me a terrorist. And then a teacher walked by and was like, “Oh my god, are you okay?” and I didn't feel like I could trust a teacher either, and I didn't connect with anyone. I never really told my family about it. Verbal harassment and other forms of assault or hearing about violence occurring to other members of the community were common among this sample. For example, Sara described an incident at work when a coworker made a violent Islamophobic comment. “All Muslims are terrorists. And if not, they're on the way to being terrorists.” I mean this is the President's mentality, but it's been voiced since September 11 many times. I actually had a person at my work, and they didn't know I was Muslim, say to me, uh “I hope they shoot all of them [Muslims].” Sara also described the harrowing impact of the awareness of her own vulnerability when she read that 875 hate crimes had been reported within the prior two weeks. Given the prevalence of these experiences, it is not surprising that many participants felt their safety, acceptance, and belonging in society was uncertain and fragile. The result of such experiences was described as provoking an ongoing alertness and attentiveness of their sur- roundings (e.g., physical environment, interpersonal relationships etc.). This hypervigilance felt disorienting, emotionally draining, and detrimental to the development of trust with others and institutionally. Even when fear was not the predominant emotion, participants described a constant expectation of impending discrimination. Some labeled this precarious uncertainty of how others will respond to them as disorienting,” others expressed experiencing a complicated acceptance; a normalization of discriminatory experiences that oscillated between feeling defeated at sometimes while at other times, hoping for change. 4.3 | Theme three: Exclusion, marginalization, and subjugation through policies Participants shared experiences of being overtly targeted and discriminated against and highlighted the pain they endured when they experienced covert forms of marginalization and exclusion through policies. Violent and discriminatory policies ranged across contexts including work, school, and in hospital settings. These experiences included religious discrimination during hiring, medical, and academic environments due to visible markers of their SALEEM ET AL. | 433 faith. One individual recalled a school‐wide policy implemented after 9/11 when she was in grade school. This policy banned elementary schoolchildren from wearing a hijab. Some experienced lack of inclusivity on numerous occasions, for example, not receiving appropriate accommodations for religious holidays or diet in their place of work or education. Similarly, participants discussed the barriers they faced when trying to practice their religious obligations, particularly daily prayers. Obstructions included lacking privacy and risking being fired if they were to be seen praying. On numerous occasions, participants explained that adhering to daily prayers, which was often considered to be an important, calming part of their faith, became difficult to navigate, and that, for some, finding a way to do so jeopardized their safety and job security. Most also experienced more direct oppression resulting from these policies when they targeted and harassed by the police, airport security, and legal authorities. For example, Ayesha participant reported police arrived at her family's home and interrogated family members about their connection to a suspected terrorist, a name they did not recognize. Numerous participants spoke about being profiled and discriminated against by airport security for appearing Muslim (e.g., wearing a hijab). Omar described being falsely accused by airport security of possessing an explosive device. These experiences of individual acts of discrimination, harassment or violence paralleled and occurred within the larger systemic, institutional, and structural manifestations of violence across a diverse range of settings. Participants felt that this lack of structural awareness and inclusion of Muslims constituted a systemic failure. Ayesha contextualized their experiences as part of the continuation of anti‐minority policies in the United States: The Japanese had it, the African Americans had it, now it's the Muslims' turn. We're in that awkward phase and I'm like you know what, been there, done that, I've been there I'm not worried about it. It's just something that happens, it's a process. 4.4 | Theme four: Muslims as spokespersons for Islam Having to defend and speak up about their Muslim identity and religion against misconceptions and misinformation was a shared common experience. Omar spoke directly of their horror at Donald Trump's statement “Muslims report stuff,” describing it as an example, on a macro level, of the belief that in order for Muslims to have rights and protection, they need to denounce “Muslim violence.” This participant described how this tactic not only perpe- tuates stereotypes of the Muslim community as one “conglomerate” body, but provokes an “us versus them” mentality. The pervasive pressure to defend Islam and act as a spokesperson, without the option to refuse, felt op- pressive. Although participants described that under some circumstances, they may appreciate the offer and platform to express themselves, in most instances, it felt imposed upon them as an obligation. Participants re- peatedly described experiences of being questioned at inappropriate times and having to defend against bigoted statements in ways that were stressful, exhausting, and time‐consuming. Some attributed the frequency of this experience to be connected to a lack of Muslim representation in society, putting them in the position of having to be the spokesperson. Sara explained: With lack of representation, there are just additional stressors that, at times, might be difficult to articulate because it might come across as rude or inconsiderate and it's neither of those. It's just a reality of how often you have to be the sole representation of your identity that inevitably is taxing—and it's such a distinct part of you, and it's taxing in a way that other people just don't have to think about. 434 | SALEEM ET AL. A Muslim female participant described being overwhelmed by probing questions as to whether her choice to wear a hijab was because of sexism in Islam. She felt that people were trying to get her to justify her decision by making her defend against misconceptions of her faith and her relationship to Islam. Despite her awareness that these were inaccurate assumptions, she felt responsible to defend that Islam was not the “bad guy.” Participants felt as though others brought with them the unrealistic expectation that they held extensive, scholarly knowledge of Islam. Indeed, as Hafsa described, they felt they needed to demonstrate very advanced knowledge of nuanced knowledge about Islam to successfully field such questions: “‘Oh, I have a question for you!’ I think it's good, just, sometimes, it's a little overwhelming because you feel like…you always have to sort of have an answer and I'm not a …. religious scholar.” Given the daily pressure to defend against Islamophobic stereotypes, some participants found themselves limiting their interactions and engagement in wider community projects to avoid feeling the obligation to be a spokesperson. There was a felt need to respond to the misconceptions that Muslims oppose “American values” or whether Muslims belong in the United States themselves. This experience culminated in what was described as a Catch‐22 situation: on the one hand, having to defend and educate others was taxing and exhausting, and on the other hand, feeling at risk of violence and Islamophobia if they neglect to take up the spokesperson role, especially at work and educational settings. Some participants described feelings of guilt about the entire dilemma. 4.5 | Theme five: Intersecting marginalized identities and oppression With limited and overwhelmingly negative Muslim representation, the diversity within the Muslim community is often overlooked. Participants' diverse experiences were especially rich and varying based upon intersecting identities and aspects of social location. The Muslim communities in the United States are heterogenous in terms of ethnicity, gender, immigration status, generational cohort, and other factors. It was very common for participants to speak about their unique set of identities and the ways it had shaped their personal experiences of structural violence as a Muslim. This countered what participants felt to be an essentialization or exoticization of Muslims, whose intersectionality is obscured when viewed as a collective “other.” Gender was one such factor that was spoken about as resulting in unique forms of marginalization and harassment. Muslim women encountered stressors and considerations in their decision about wearing a hijab. Many participants had to consider their safety or intersecting immigration status. Sara described the humiliating experience of having her partner rip off her hijab in public for fear of her safety. Naila, an immigrant, discussed an experience of being harassed because she was wearing a hijab. After this, her family feared for her safety. She explains, “A boy called me a terrorist and my mom was like, Take off your hijab they're going to kick us out of the country. You cannot wear it.” Tahmina described the pressure she felt to fit into dominant, Eurocentric norms to avoid painful experiences of harassment: This word [terrorist] was used and they would talk about my family. They would say “Oh your father looks like a terrorist,” and then at that point I was like “What's a,” I honestly did not even know what terrorist meant. And I was 16. I thought “What's a terrorist?” and, “if so, why is it so bad?” So, and “Oh, your family wears turbans and you guys wear rags,” and…You know, those kinds of things. It was hurtful…I mean it wasn't hurtful to the point where I became so depressed, but it was more that I pulled away from who I was…. I didn't want to be this brown person or Muslim, whatever, at that time… even my name was, like, I guess you can say anglicized. Other women felt that wearing a hijab prevented them from being employed. Sara believed if she had worn her hijab during her current work's hiring process, she would not have been offered the job. However, Hafsa felt that wearing a hijab protected her from the sexualization she used to experience before wearing it and reported less cat‐calling in public spaces. SALEEM ET AL. | 435 Participants who identified as Black or African American expressed their experiences of pain, exclusion, and rejection within the Muslim community. They expressed that the pain of being rejected from other Muslims was compounded by an already existing lack of representation and exclusion based upon their Black identity in the United States. Zahara, who identified as a Black American Muslim, recalled her parents' experience in the Muslim community, describing how they had a difficult time finding their place in the Muslim world because her father is Black. She explained that for a long time, she had an idea “of what Muslim looks like or what Muslim is,” that did not include herself or her family. Because she was an African American Muslim, who does not “cover,” and was not raised “orthodox,” she wrestled with feelings of exclusion and discrimination: It's very hard when I go to mostly Arab or South Asian mosques…. you really do feel like you don't fit in. There is also, of course, discrimination within the Muslim community. Like, with Black Muslims or even African American Muslims here, if you go to mosques that are predominantly Black or pre- dominantly African American, you can see that the mosque usually isn't the greatest or in the best shape. Numerous participants who had converted to Islam reported that this experience came with added frustration as an “outsider within an outsider community.” Some recounted their experiences of being marginalized and rejected from their Muslim community, describing the pressure to conform to dominating cultural and ethnic elements. Intersections of immigration, acculturation status, and language also uniquely shaped experiences of structural violence. This included added stressors of navigating the United States' culture as noncitizens, as nonnative English speakers, as multiracial, combined with the intergenerational impact of immigration. Tahmina explained the iso- lating impact these factors had on her mother's health: For my father, because he's very social and he was working, he was okay. He didn't feel so isolated. My mom, on the other hand, I think it's probably when her depression got even worse because not only did she not have any family, she was newly married and she had babies right away, she didn't go to school, she didn't have any Bengali friends, you know? So she was forced to learn English—broken English. There were no Muslims. For my mom, I would say it was the hardest. Some participants who had immigrated to America described how cautious they felt they must be as an immigrant and as Muslim. They took extra precautions to keep their personal affairs in order and avoid any attention from institutional and authority figures. 4.6 | Theme six: Challenges of navigating Muslim identity Participants shared experiences about having to consistently navigate what it means to be Muslim in a socio- political context of intensifying Islamophobia. They spoke about their awareness of dominant social narratives and stereotypes about Muslims. They also explained how they reconciled these narratives with their personal sense of their own dignity and humanity. Several participants recounted specific incidents, often triggered by a form of harassment, that led them to deeply reflect on their faith and Muslim identity. Oftentimes, this exploration of their faith, influenced by inter- personal and social experiences, led them to reconnect with it in a deeper, more spiritually meaningful and authentic manner. Omar explained that after being the victim of physical assault, he questioned Islam, a process that expanded his development and personal faith: “So that was one of the moments that got me really thinking like ‘Wait, what the heck is Islam?' So, then I started diving into my faith a bit more as kind of like a 12‐year‐old or 436 | SALEEM ET AL. 13‐year‐old.” Zahara articulates: “A lot of my family members are afraid to say they're Muslim, especially after 9/11, because they don't want people to associate them with the view of Islam… they don't want be seen as the terrorists.” Other participants expressed that they experienced pain upon realizing that they had internalized the wider Islamophobic rhetoric about Muslims in a way that resulted in them feeling ostracized from their own community. Tahmina explained that because she did not fit the limited, stereotypical image of a Muslim, nor did she strongly identify with strict Muslim practices, she felt stripped of her identity: “Society tells you need to look Muslim. If you don't look Muslim or act Muslim, then you're not.” This experience, as described by various participants, is often followed by reflection regarding self and relationship to community to develop their Muslim identity inclusively and authentically. During the interview, the participant realized that she had forgotten certain periods of her life, concluding that she had tried to forget about the times when she had not felt true to herself: I didn't want to think about it, I wasn't really myself, or didn't allow me to be myself because I gave into what society thought was okay for me, or a cool thing to do…. To be, perceived as a White person, to not be brown, even though my skin was brown. This experience demonstrates the complex interplay of her intersecting identities in relation to a larger culture of structural violence that oppresses Muslims and people of color. For some participants, there was no specific moment that served as a catalyst to their self and social reflection. Indeed, many did not readily identify a formative moment that shaped their Muslim identity. Rather, they felt that having to confront certain notions of Islam in the media, in conversations, or through policies that impacted their daily life led them to engage in a subtler, more ongoing reflective process. Sara described her discomfort in being privy to Islamophobic comments from peers who assumed that because she is White, she could not be Muslim. Omar expressed being a Muslim involves having to always consider “negotiating your Muslim identity and personal convenience.” For another participant, society's Islamophobia manifested in feeling personal dejection as he questioned his self‐worth. He considers the ways in which ongoing experiences of structural violence have shaped his “imposter syndrome,” or feelings of self‐doubt, that he was undeserving of his achievements. He also connected this kind of marginalization to trauma: Often, I think we talk about specific subordinate identities and the challenge of that and kind of keep it inside that bubble. Sometimes it throws in the narrative to infuse perspectives and it's like “boom,” now you have an understanding of Islamophobia. But I think all of the collective margin- alization, the real thing we should actually be focusing on is trauma. Significant trauma. Overall, these experiences of identity crisis and reconciliation were interstitial, balanced by reclaiming spiri- tuality and deepening understanding of Islam, self, and community, as further elaborated in the next theme. 4.7 | Theme seven: Resilience and resistance through faith, activism, and community Most participants identified being connected with their community and faith as a source of resilience, strength, and pride. Despite having experienced structural violence because of their Muslim identity, Islam was identified as a source of strength and coping. This was evidenced by both their personal practice and relationship with Islam, as well as the ways in which their faith connected them to family and community. In one instance, Malika, a multi- racially identified participant, familiar with the teachings of both Christianity and Islam, discussed how her re- lationship to Islam and the Muslim community saved her from drug addiction. She, as well as other participants, SALEEM ET AL. | 437 described the therapeutic and peaceful effects of prayer. For her, the belief that she would have to answer for her deeds when she died led her to consistently revisit the following questions: What have you done in your life? Okay, have you asked for forgiveness? Have you done kind things? Or, you know, have you tried to improve yourself and strip yourself of bad habits and addictions and everything along the way? What have you done? Multiple participants emphasized the ways in which their life had been shaped by their confrontations with structural violence. They discussed that part of their experience involved developing resiliency and resourcefulness as well as motivation to engage in advocacy and social justice work. Ayesha was moved to tears as she shared that her decision to focus on social justice and activism in her career stemmed from her personal experiences as an African American Muslim woman. Others have found solace in hobbies, such as spoken word poetry, or simply the awareness that websites and other resources exist that are Muslim‐led or that accurately capture the diversity of Muslim experiences. They used these as resources to disseminate information when they were questioned about Islam and to others via social media. Ayesha and Omar explained their involvement in social justice activism and efforts to instill policy change in their place of work as a way in which they took up resistance. Participants also mentioned the value of Muslim representation and mentorship as it provided a small, yet significant way to subvert personal feelings of marginalization. Participants mentioned that their connection to community has been a source of pride and hope for them. Malika who candidly expressed experiencing instances of discrimination both within and outside of the Muslim community, also articulated the following: I do appreciate the community because I will say that when I do enter the mosque… I do feel very much like part of something bigger… at the end, usually there's usually food downstairs and ev- eryone gets together and you talk with people…A lot of times there are people there to help you with whatever issues you're going through because they probably went through those issues…Every Ramadan and every Eid you get this renewed hope. I feel amazing, I feel renewed. Additionally, experiences of acceptance and respect shown to participants were highlighted as especially validating experiences. For example, one participant expressed that when this part of his identity was included and respected, it felt profoundly validating. In a joint interview, a Muslim couple noted the community's ability to collectively respond resiliently after 9/11 served to strengthen relationships and community organization: Participant 1: But then that's how the interfaith groups started, and that's how all the different relationships with other communities started as well. Participant 2: Yeah, so it's like, it's like, the more antagonizing things happened to the Muslim community, the more organized we've been forced to become, the more organized we have become. Similarly, some participants reported that along with an increase in Islamophobia during and following the 2016 election, corresponding solidarity from non‐Muslims, (e.g., promoting inter‐faith dialogs) also increased. However, a few expressed concerns that these acts of solidarity may have appeased the anxieties of well‐ intentioned non‐Muslims but were insufficient for dismantling societal and structural Islamophobia. 5 | DI SCUSSION These stories of pervasive oppressive experiences of marginalization, exclusion, and discrimination rooted in negative Islamophobic stereotypes of Muslims as violent, backward, and extremist are consistent with previous literature (Budhwani & Hearld, 2017; Hodge et al., 2015). The negative impact of such experiences on mental and 438 | SALEEM ET AL. physical health (Abu‐Ras & Suarez, 2009, Gee & Ford, 2011; Williams & Mohammed, 2009) is also well‐ documented. The racialized and xenophobic underpinnings of Islamophobic ideology is significant and connects these experiences to that of other similarly targeted communities, thus highlighting the need for a larger socio- political analysis. Although experiences of oppression and structural violence of Muslims in the United States are unique and specific in many ways, contextualizing these findings within the larger context of racism and anti‐ immigrant attitudes enriches our understanding and allows for connecting these participants' experiences with similar experiences reported by other marginalized communities (Langhout, 2019). Islamophobia was seen to be perpetuated and supported by people in positions of sociopolitical power. The psychological and physical violence inflicted in interpersonal interactions paralleled the institutional, structural, and policy‐level discrimination and harm resulting from limited access to employment, health, legal and other societal supports and accountability. This confirms the urgent need for a framework of structural violence to understand these harmful conditions. Reframing individual negative experiences as instances of structural violence is critical given its documented devastating impact on an individual's sense of humanity, dignity, identity, well‐ being, and self‐worth (Carter, 2007; Dutta et al., 2016). The internalization (i.e., an oppressed group believing in oppressed narrative about themselves) of racist and Islamophobic narratives and negative stereotypes about themselves, their community, and feelings of shame for being part of the Muslim community clearly impacted their understanding of themselves and their relationship to others and led some participants to distance themselves from their communities for fear of being targeted (e.g., changing their physical appearance). This is consistent with literature showing how the oppressed can internalize dominant negative narratives and stereotypes about themselves as outsiders, morally deviant, and wrongdoers resulting in increased feelings of inferiority and reduced agency (Liebow, 2016). Despite making these changes, these participants still did not feel accepted by the non‐ Muslim community, leaving them with feeling a lack of belonging and inclusion in any community. It is documented that lost sense of community in a politically constructed group can have a destructive psychological impact (Chen et al., 2019; Salfas et al., 2018; Sonn & Fisher, 1996). The constant demands to justify one's choices of clothing, religion, and ethnic and cultural practices resonate with the notion of cultural violence (Galtung, 1969), i.e., experiences intricately linked to structural violence and produced through culture, language, and ideology. The shared experiences spanned across a diverse range of ethnicities, national backgrounds, ages, education, immigration status, religious involvement, and socioeconomic means. These findings are consistent with the literature that shows that structural violence operates at multiple levels in society and through a diverse range of mechanisms to create and support the marginalization and exclusion of the targeted communities (Farmer, 2003; Galtung, 1969; Martín‐Baró,1996). It should be noted that structural violence also took shape differently for participants depending on the interaction of each of their unique identities and their context. Results from this study indicate differences in lived experiences at the intersections of multiple marginalized identities; thus, it is necessary for scholars to have a nuanced and contextual understanding of differences and diversity within the Muslim community so as not to reproduce the stereotypes of Muslims as a homogenous and monolithic community. This is consistent with other research on intersectional identities and social justice issues (Crenshaw,1991; Bowleg, 2008; Butler, 2015). It is impossible to address Islamophobic structural violence in the United States without connecting it to the political and historical global context in which it occurs as these conditions are intricately intertwined. Islamo- phobic stereotypes of Muslims are essential to gaining support for the “war on terror” (Sides & Gross;2013). Therefore, the relationship between the United States' foreign policy and military aggressions against Muslim countries, both before and after 9/11, and the existence of demonizing narratives, often portrayed with the complicity of media, resulting in oppressive policies (i.e., detentions, deportations, torture, surveillance, amongst other tactics) targeting Muslims along with other racialized communities within the United States cannot be ignored. These connections are documented by interdisciplinary scholars who link the United States' and Western geopolitical agendas, foreign policy, imperialism and colonialism with that of racist ethnocentric stereotypes of Muslims and Islam (Kumar, 2012; Said, 1978). Thus, detailed frameworks of intersectionality and decolonization SALEEM ET AL. | 439 are essential to the dismantling of these systems and practices and challenging the dominant frameworks as stated by hooks and Mesa‐Bains (2006), “We have to constantly critique imperialist white supremacist patriarchal culture because it is normalized by mass media and rendered unproblematic.” However, it is critical to underscore the significance of not seeing those targeted by structural violence simply as victims but as people existing and surviving in the face of oppressive structural violence which is in itself an act of resilience and resistance. Evidence of resilience in our findings indicated it was often connected to community, family, and faith. Scholars have argued that resilience should be understood and promoted not just on an individual level but at a community level, particularly with marginalized communities (Clauss‐Ehlers; 2008; McMillan & Chavis, 1986). The reliance on one's identity‐based community in the face of oppressive conditions confirms the importance of “strategic essentialism” (Spivak, 1988), a political tactic used by minority groups based on shared identity to represent themselves in struggles for their collective rights. Temporarily “essentializing” can be a useful strategy for achieving specific goals and does not negate the differences that exist between groups due to different intersectional identities. 5.1 | Implications for theory and practice The narratives of Muslims reacting, responding, and surviving in the face of structural violence are worth ex- amining for their implications for supporting individuals and communities facing adversity. Gaining an enhanced quality of life through these intentional communities of care was reflected in the narratives of our participants. They clearly spoke about their personal relationship to their faith, families, and communities as therapeutic, restorative and as their primary sources of strength. These findings support creating intentional trusted com- munities of care based on shared social identities that has been identified by Liberation Psychology as a healing mechanism (Martín‐Baró, 1996) in strengthening, resisting, and healing from the impact of oppression. Community resilience forms a sense of collective healing as a strength‐based response to oppression through which margin- alized groups reinforce their existing communal strengths and sense of identity (Clauss‐Ehlers, 2008; Sonn & Fisher, 1996). Communities organizing around marginalized identities can also facilitate political understanding of their negative experiences. This can result in advocacy‐based responses to structural violence and its impact instead of solely treating it as an individual mental health issue. The solutions need to be both individual and sociopolitical. Engagement in activist organizing and participation as an act of collective political resistance has been shown to result in enhancing one's sense of wellbeing (Gilster, 2012) and must be incorporated in academic and clinical theories. In fact, younger Muslims reported social justice organizing and advocacy as a coping mechanism. Academic scholarship and clinical theories that do not incorporate a political analysis do not allow for the recognition of the significant legal, political, economic, and institutional factors that form the underpinning of these individual experiences of oppression. The discipline of psychology has a long history of creating and replicating structural oppression by producing knowledge about marginalized communities without including them (Alvares, 2011; Berrey, 2015) and colluding with institutions of oppression. This has caused immeasurable harm. A recent stark example is the role of the American Psychological Association (APA) in its secret collusion with the Bush administration policies of torture of Muslims at Guantanamo Bay (Hoffman et al., 2015; Soldz et al., 2017). Thus, as researchers and practitioners, we must include and center the voices of marginalized people to help with our understanding of their experiences and oppression to stand in solidarity with them to counter the rhetoric that vilifies them. As part of this, we must recognize that individual models of psychotherapy based on manualized diagnosis and treatment are not only not helpful, but potentially harmful. These models problematize the individual and do not address sociopolitical factors. They can replicate cultural imperialism and structural oppression (Thrift & Sugarman, 2019). Psychology's tendency to analyze and treat individuals within theoretical frameworks em- bedded within the dominant cultural paradigm can be detrimental in dealing with the impact of structural and 440 | SALEEM ET AL. historical violence (Thrift & Sugarman, 2019). It should be noted that social justice‐concerned psychology, including community, cross‐cultural, and feminist psychology theorists, has emphasized contextual factors, particularly the role of power in human suffering (Ballou et al., 2016; Comas‐Díaz et al., 2019). These frameworks must also integrate community‐based advocacy and grassroot activism to actualize structural changes. 5.2 | Limitations and future directions This qualitative and community‐engaged nature of this study limits how our findings can be ethically applied to others; however, some overlap can be reasonably expected in experiences of structural violence, given the larger shared context within the United States. Given the specifics of this sample, it is largely transferable to heterosexual cisgender Muslim women from the northeastern United States. Experiences of Islamophobia and structural vio- lence were largely within the context of living in the northeastern region. Ultimately, this means that the narratives represented here provide an in‐depth and nuanced exploration of their specific experiences of structural violence. It is to be expected that different stories of structural violence may emerge from individuals whose identities are not prominent in this sample. Future studies will need to develop a better understanding of potential gender and regional differences in the experiences of structural violence as a Muslim person. 6 | CONCLUSION While Islamophobia towards Muslims is not new, given the escalating anti‐Muslim climate globally and within the United States, studies like this are urgently needed to bear witness to its devasting detrimental impact on the lives of Muslims and its connections to current sociopolitical realities. Through applying the structural violence framework to our findings, we connect them to the larger context of xenophobia, racism, violence, and oppression faced by marginalized commu- nities. Through this study, we hope to promote the development of mutually liberating activism and organizing that results in collaborative solutions towards dismantling structural oppression. Given the significant role of academia in producing theories and knowledge that shape opinions and create policies, listening to and incorporating the voices of marginalized communities is essential to redressing oppressive inequities. This ultimately requires active engagement with marginalized communities and grassroots movements of resistance to create emancipatory social transformation.
