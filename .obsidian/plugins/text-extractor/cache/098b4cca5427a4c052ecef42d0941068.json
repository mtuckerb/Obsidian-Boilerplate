{"path":"Divorce/Motion to Modify 2024-06-27/Attachments/Job Search Statement.pdf","text":"I was rendered unemployed by Copia on November 24th 2023. At this time, I believed that I would be able to find new employment in my field relatively soon. I started submitting targeted applications to organizations that were at the top of my list. Between November and January 2023, I reached out to colleagues and friends, to see if they could introduce or recommend me for positions in their companies or within their business networks. I also started attending a group that met monthly for mutual support and encouragement as we all struggled to find new roles. By January of 2023, I was beginning to become concerned that a new role would not be forthcoming. I had exhausted my professional contacts, and was deeply involved in the application process. I began to set up systems to streamline my job search, I subscribed to a service called TealHQ that could compare my resume to the posted job description and make recommendations for improvements that would allow my resume to pass the first test that modern HR departments establish as a gate. This is when I learned about Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), and the AI that \"grades\" each incoming resume. I learned that remote employers receive hundreds or thousands of applications and do not look at anything lower than the 75th percentile. Most applications below 90th percentile never get seen without an internal reference. My goal at this point was to format and target each resume to the job description, in order to maximize my success with this first step. On March 07 2024 I attended a workshop \"How to Land a Job in 8 Weeks,\" which mainly revolved around activating your network, which I had already exhausted. On April 22nd I received my first interview at Evidation. I had 3 interviews there with 7 people and advanced to the final round. I was passed over for that role. My next opportunity was June 3rd 2024, when I interviewed with Redflag AI. I had 3 interviews in total with 5 people and advanced to the final round. I then interviewed with Code.org on July 3rd 2024. I had a really great feeling about this opportunity and felt, based on my previous history of interviewing, that I had this job in the bag. I proceeded with confidence through three rounds of interviews with 7 people, and was told on August 7th that, while it had been very close, they had decided to go with another candidate. I had another brief interview cycle with Tangelo on August 23rd and 30th. Again my confidence was high after speaking with the CEO, but I was passed over by their HR manager in a subsequent cursory interview. I began receiving TANF support on September 6th 2024. Part of the onboarding process for Fedcap (who administer the TANF career development programs for the State of Maine), was to do a career assessment. I took a test and had an interview with a specialist and it was determined that Social Work was the career that I should retrain for (based on my strengths, weaknesses and opportunities). Based on this recommendation, I was issued a Career Plan - Family Contract (by Fedcap) on September 9th in which a agreed to pursue a career in Social Work. As I did not yet have a Bachelor's degree, I applied to the University of Southern Maine's School for Social Work program. I was accepted into USM's Social Work program on October 24th 2024. As you will see in the Job Search Log, I continued to apply for many jobs in the Tech sector each week, and supplemented that search with other industries. On January 15th 2025, I interviewed with MAS Medical for a position as an after-school Behavioral Health Professional (BHP). My USM classes began on January 21st. The first day of work with MAS Medical was January 28th. On February 5th I interviewed with CATT Associates for another BHP role, and began work with that client on March 3rd 2025. While these BHP roles have been much easier to secure, they are limited to â‰¤ 15hrs/week and would not provide a salary that is above 200% of the Federal Poverty Limit. (~$30000/year). Better paying roles are available when I earn my Bachelor's in Social Work, those jobs start closer to $50,000/year. As of May 15th 2025, I am still applying for jobs in the technical and technical leadership fields, but am receiving only rejections or silence in response. I have read in the news and heard from other friends who have been laid of in tech, that there have been hundreds of thousands of jobs cut from the tech market (largely from Big 5 companies), leaving a glut of technical workers and leaders. This, combined with a shift towards AI for many roles, and a shift (beginning in 2020) towards ever more remote jobs (meaning non-local workforce is now part of the applicant pool), has changed my opinion of my job prospects from what it was in March of 2023, when I told the judge that I was confident that I could secure a job at $75 - $125,000/year. At this time, I believe that my maximum earning capacity is closer to $30,000/year.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
