Getting heads (or tails) on a flip does not affect the outcome of the next flip. 3) The probabilities are constant. P (tails) = 0.5 and P (heads) = 0.5 for every flip. 4) There are only two possible outcomes: heads or tails. We are going to calculate the mathematically predicted mean and standard deviation for the results of some binomial probability distributions. We will then determine if some actual results are above or below what was mathematically expected. The mean (also known as the average) is denoted by the symbol , pronounced mue. The standard deviation (expected spread in the data) is denoted by σ, lower case sigma. Number of trials (sample size) is denoted by n. p is the probability of success and q is the probability of failure. For the binomial we calculate the mean and standard deviation as follows: = np The mean equals number of trials times the probability of success. σ = The standard deviation equals the square root of the number of trials times the probability of success times the probability of failure. μ μ n pq EXAMPLE 1: Are 20% of m&m’s orange? Mars incorporated claims that 20% of its plain m&m candies are orange. Consider a random selection of 100 plain m&m’s. a) Find the mean and standard deviation for the number of orange candies in such a group of 100. b) If such a group contained 29 orange candies, would that be considered unusual? Solution: a) There are 100 trials (100 m&m’s). So, n = 100. The probability of success (of being orange), is 0.20, so p = 0.20. The probability of failure ( of being not orange), is 0.80, so q = 0.80. Now that we know the values of n, p & q, we can calculate the mean and standard deviation. = np, so = 100*0.20, so = 20 σ = , so σ = so, σ = , σ = 4 The mean is 20 and the standard deviation is 4. b) To determine if 29 out of 100 orange candies is statistically unusual, we need two simple formulas. One gives us the lowest number that would be usual (normally expected to happen). The other gives us the highest number that would be usual. These two formulas are called the minimum and maximum usual. The minimum usual is the mean minus two standard deviations The maximum usual is the mean plus two standard deviations So, for our orange m&m problem: Minimum usual = = = 20 8 = 12 Maximum usual = = = 20 8 = 28 In a randomly selected group of 100, 12 to 28 orange m&m’s is statistically usual, within normal range μ μ μ npq (100)(0.2)(0.8) 16 μ − 2σ μ + 2σ μ − 2σ 20 − 2 × 4 − μ + 2σ 20 + 2 × 4 + 29 is above the maximum usual of 28. 29 is out of normal range. Yes, 29 out of 100 orange m&m’s would be unusual. EXAMPLE 2: When Mendel conducted his famous genetics experiments with peas, one sample of offspring consisted of 580 peas. It was Mendel’s theory that 25% of them should be yellow. a) If Mendel’s theory is correct, find the mean and standard deviation for the number of yellow peas in such groups of 580. b) The actual results consisted of 152 yellow peas. Is that an unusually high amount? Solution: a) n=580 p=0.25 q=0.75 = np, so = 580*0.25, so = 145 σ = so σ = so σ = so σ = 10.4 b) To determine if 152 is unusually high, we must calculate the maximum usual. max usual = = = 145 + 20.8 = 165.8 Since the maximum usual is 165.8, 152 is not unusually high. 152 is said to be within normal range. μ μ μ npq (580)(0.25)(0.75) 108.75 μ + 2σ 145 + 2*10.4 EXAMPLE 3: Deciphering Messages The CIA has specialists who analyze the frequencies of letters of the alphabet in an attempt to decipher intercepted messages that are sent as ciphered text. In standard English text, the letter e is used at a frequency of 12.7%. a) Find the mean and standard deviation for the number of times the letter e will be found on a typical page of 2,600 characters. b) An intercepted page of 2,600 characters is found to have the letter e occurring 290 times. Is 290 unusually low or high? Solution: a) n = 2,600 p = 12.7% = 0.127 q = 87.3% = 0.873 = np, so = 2,600*0.127, so = 330.2 σ = so σ = so σ = so σ = 17 b) Is 290 unusually low or high? We need to find the minimum and maximum usual. minimum usual = = = = 296.2 maximum usual = = = = 364.2 Normal range is from 296.2 to 364.2. 290 is unusually low because it is below the minimum usual. μ μ μ npq (2,600)(0.127)(0.873) 288.3 μ − 2σ 330.2 − 2(17) 330.2 − 34 μ + 2σ 330.2 + 2(17) 330.2 + 34","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
