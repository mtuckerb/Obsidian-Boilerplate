Focusing on deaf and hard of hearing (HoH) people, we ask how their smartphone usage reﬂects cultural norms of communication, centering on the mobile voice call as a core function that creates tension among this population. We analyze their smartphone usage, based not only on their disabilities, but also on various other identities and narratives. Our intervie- wees’ relationship with smartphone voice calls is shown to be strongly dependent on social and cul- tural expectations. Although these expectations derive mostly from hearing society’s stigmatizing perceptions of “normalcy,” they are also created by the cultural norms of the Deaf1 community.

Based on 20 in-depth interviews, our ﬁndings show how cultural perceptions of disability, com- munication and technology feed into personal motivations for using smartphones. We found that even the use of visually accessible functions—such as WhatsApp and video calls—can be shaped by communicative norms of immediacy associated with the voice call. Moreover, our intersectional anal- ysis suggests that members of privileged social groups are more likely to resist hearing cultural com- municative expectations, while people from national and ethnic minorities, as well as women, tend to make greater eﬀorts to pass as hearing. This positions the smartphone as a potential instrument of cul- tural exclusion. This article thus oﬀers a critical perspective on communication and accessibility, raising the fol- lowing central questions: How do ableist norms of “hearing” communication interact with assump- tions of constant mobile reachability in shaping deaf and HoH people’s smartphone use? And more importantly, how might the accessible features of the smartphone themselves contribute to the social oppression of disabled users, especially when they are part of diverse social groups? The article is organized as follows: we ﬁrst introduce the cultural construction of “ideal” ableist communication, the unique position of the smartphone in this context, and the setting for this study: deaf and HoH people in Israel. This is followed by an exposition of our methods. We then present our ﬁndings: ﬁrst we show how the performative norms of voice calls penetrate textual and visual func- tions of smartphones; and second, we lay out the range of responses and practices among deaf and HoH smartphone users regarding voice calls. The ﬁndings show that the technical features of the smartphone, as well as other new media technologies, do not necessarily oﬀer ﬂexibly expressive com- munication formats for members of marginalized groups. In fact, these tools tend to serve the hege- monic communicative and cultural social order and might force it on people who are perceived as deviant. Background Communication norms, stigma and passing The notion of ideal human communication is predicated on the use of spoken language, often per- ceived as the quintessential form of communication (St. Pierre, 2015). Spoken language’s use of natu- ral hearing and oral ability makes it a crucial tool in people’s behavior in, and adjustment and socialization to, a given environment (Dance & Larson, 1972). People who lack the ability to speak may thereby be excluded from society or labeled as socially incompetent. This liberal humanist per- spective deﬁnes those who are able to speak “properly” as human and rational, while marking others as non-normative (St. Pierre, 2015). Indeed, as noted by Glenn (2004), “speaking or speaking out con- tinues to signal power, liberation, or civilization itself. That seeming obverse, silence, signals nothing- ness” (p. 3). The rise of computer-mediated communication has transformed traditional communication pat- terns, primarily speech, into new media-based practices (Manovich, 2001). At the same time, media richness theory states that rich media provide instant feedback, multiple cues, language variety, and a personal focus. Thus, face-to-face, spoken communication is seen as the richest medium (Daft, Lengel, & Trevino, 1987), while mediated communication requires greater cognitive eﬀort. In order to reduce this eﬀort, people include “natural” features in their electronic communication, such as voice calls (Kock, 2005). All this, however, assumes able-bodiedness and ignores individuals with diﬀerent com- munication needs, such as stutterers, or deaf and HoH people. 57Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 N. Bitman & N. A. John Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone UsersDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 One consequence of the perception of these groups’ inability to speak “normally” is their stigmati- zation (Goﬀman, 1963). Regarding people with disabilities, stigma often sharpens the perception of impairment as a problem whose solution will enable social integration. In contrast to this individual medical model of disability, the social perspective does not see deaf or HoH people, for example, as disabled because they have a hearing impairment, but rather because of society’s failure to accommo- date their communication needs. Moreover, the medical model of disability produces compulsory able-bodiedness, understood as a system of cultural practices and perceptions that maintains an able- bodied hegemony. This process works by taking able-bodiedness for granted and marking disabled people as in need of a “cure” (Kafer, 2003; McRuer, 2006). A common response, and an important part of deaf and HoH people’s social identity, is passing (Eichengreen, 2014). This practice is rooted in the stigmatization of deaf and HoH people due to their diﬃculties in meeting cultural communicative standards. They are expected to use hearing aids and have cochlear implants, as well as to undergo speech therapy from infanthood, so that their speech may sound as close to “normal” as possible. This medical rehabilitation ﬂags Deaf culture and sign language as non-normative, rejects the cultural expression of Deaf people (Shoham, 2004), and labels them as “oral failures” (Harmon, 2013, p. 169). Thus, speech becomes a central component of deaf and HoH people’s identity (Eichengreen, 2014). This is reﬂected in a felt sense of audistic superiority “based on one’s ability to hear or behave in a manner of one who hears” (Humphries, 1977, p. 13) as part of the power relations between the hearing hegemony and the Deaf minority (Eckert & Rowley, 2013). As a result, HoH people try to distinguish themselves from Deaf people and avoid the stigma attached to them by passing as hearing (Harmon, 2013). However, the social risk of being exposed and stigmatized remains (Goﬀman, 1963). The aspiration to pass as hearing leads some HoH people to over-satisfy the hearing environment (Eichengreen, Almog, & Broyer, 2016) and to invest social and psychological eﬀorts in avoiding dis- crimination (Harmon, 2013). This can create a non-disabled impression, but also incorrect identiﬁca- tion, personal dissonance, and a lack of recognition of everyday diﬃculties. Trying to pass may thus transform an invisible disability into an overexposed one (Samuels, 2003) and turn the disabled body into an object of normalization (Garland-Thomson, 2002). Moreover, the dilemma of whether or not to “come out” as disabled can intensify when the severity of a disability changes (Samuels, 2003). Stigmatized individuals use various social coping strategies (Goﬀman, 1963), such as creating a distinctive group that responds to its stigma by setting a boundary between insiders and outsiders, who may harm them (Gieryn, 1983); further, the stronger the stigma, the more likely its targets are to perform aggressive boundary work (Yeshua-Katz, 2015). This practice may be found among “rehabili- tated” HoH people who socially reject signing Deaf people, who remind them of the stigma that con- stantly threatens them (Eichengreen et al., 2016). Technology, disability, normalization and the smartphone The transformative and dynamic nature of new media enables them to assist people with disabilities (Alper, 2017). Accessible computers, digital assistive devices and smartphones are popular in this con- text, thanks to their low price, easy access and “normal” appearance (Alper, Ellcessor, Ellis, & Goggin, 2015). Echoing the medical model of disability, it has been suggested that “technology has obvious promise for impaired people” (Arthur, 2009, p. 9). However, some scholars see it as an aspect of mate- rial environments designed by able-bodied people that replicate the medical oppression of diﬀerent bodies (Galis, 2011; Goggin & Newell, 2003). For instance, developers of assistive mobile media may perceive users with disabilities as homogenous (Darcy, Maxwell, & Green, 2016). On the other hand, disability sometimes does shape media (Paterson, 2016), such as Apple making the iPhone accessible, but even this was only after protests by blind people (Goggin, 2017). Overall, there is a lack of critical 58 Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone Users N. Bitman & N. A. JohnDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 discourse around the actual characteristics and implications of media for our understanding of disabil- ity (Alper, 2017). These controversies are intensiﬁed when it comes to the mobile phone. The ability to maintain constant contact with people and the emotional attachment to the medium make people feel socially dejected when separated from it (Vincent, 2006). A norm of constant reachability has developed (de Vries, 2005), which in turn has evolved into smartphone users’“fear of missing out” (FOMO) (Przybylski, Murayama, DeHaan, & Gladwell, 2013). Moreover, the range of accessible communica- tion functions in smartphones, which will be further described below, may contribute to disabled users’ dependency on them. Despite the considerable opportunities it oﬀers, the smartphone may deepen social inequalities through speciﬁc patterns of use (Marler, 2018). While privileged groups have the knowledge, cultural capital and habitus to make full use of the medium, underprivileged groups might not be able to “acti- vate” all of its social and technical functions. Thus, the smartphone may reproduce social divides that disadvantage groups that were excluded from the design process (Akrich, 1992; Wijetunga, 2014), as often occurs with new media that fail to ensure “cultural accessibility” as a result of the under- representation of people with disabilities in production processes (Ellcessor, 2017). This may partly explain why deaf and HoH people have a complex relationship with the smartphone (Maiorana-Basas & Pagliaro, 2014). Given the challenges faced by deaf and HoH people in negotiating voice calls, textual formats are viewed as particularly accessible (Barak & Sadovski, 2008) thanks to the independence and the ability to visually express emotions that they aﬀord (Maiorana-Basas & Pagliaro, 2014). Short Messages Service (SMS) was central to the use of feature phones, providing access to “hearing” environments (Power & Power, 2004). However, synchronous instant messaging (IM) has since become more wide- spread. A popular application in this regard is WhatsApp, which oﬀers instant group or dyadic mes- saging of texts, photos, audio and video calls. WhatsApp’s worldwide popularity is at least partly due to its “last seen online” notiﬁcations and its perception as a platform for ongoing informal conversa- tion (O’Hara et al., 2014). An additional accessible function is the video call, which would appear to enable Deaf people to communicate in their natural language (Cavender, Vanam, Barney, Ladner, & Riskin, 2008). Yet smartphones have failed to provide video calls that are suﬃciently intelligible for Deaf users (Tran, Riskin, Ladner, & Wobbrock, 2015). Furthermore, smartphones’ operating systems oﬀer built-in accessible functions. For instance, Samsung’s smartphones have sound detectors, ﬂash notiﬁcations, mono audio, and compatibility with hearing aids with T-coil mode, while Apple’s iOS oﬀers compatibility with custom-designed hearing aids and cochlear implants. These and other discrete functions may help users avoid commonly-held stigmas against assistive technologies (Ellis & Kent, 2011). Having said this, it is important to remember that the voice call still remains a very popular usage of smartphones in some places. For instance, the World Bank (2018) reports a worldwide growth in minutes talking on the mobile phone per subscription per month from 207 to 247 between 2010 and 2016, while time use survey data suggest that American adults spend more time talking on the phone now than they did in 2003.2 Also, in 2014 Gallup found that 82% of Americans had made a cellphone call “yesterday,” which was more than had texted, emailed or used social media on their phone. 3 Israel as a research site Israel provides fertile ground for disability mobile research. The population’s multi-culturalism (Hammer, 2012) makes Israel ideal for research that addresses intersectionality. This is where one source of oppression intersects with another, meaning that people who belong to more than one marginalized group may suﬀer greater discrimination (Meekosha & Shuttleworth, 2009), based on 59Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 N. Bitman & N. A. John Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone UsersDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 their cultural distance from the “normal body” (Davis, 1995). Thus, for instance, compulsory able- bodiedness can interact with other sources of subjugation in order to oppress disabled people from marginalized groups (Erevelles, 2011; Kafer, 2003; McRuer, 2006). This can be especially meaningful when it comes to media: for instance, it has been shown how disabled children in the global south suf- fer from a unique form of digital divide (Alper & Goggin, 2017). Of particular note is the intersection of gender and disability (Garland-Thomson, 2002), which is central to gendered discrimination in Israel (Hammer, 2012), and especially among highly disadvan- taged groups (Erevelles, 2011). This intersection is expressed through disabled women’s constant awareness and internalization of “normal” society’s gaze (Garland-Thomson, 2002). Ultra-Orthodox disabled women may experience even greater oppression. The conservative ultra-Orthodox sector is characterized by social segregation and community surveillance (Rosenberg, Blondheim, & Katz, 2016), and women are expected to have many children, run the household and be the main breadwin- ner (Israel Democracy Institute, 2015). In addition, although there are many people with disabilities in this sector (Lifshitz & Glaubman, 2004), deaf people are still stigmatized. Another important source of oppression in Israel is nationality. Israel has a large Arab minority, comprising over 20% of the population. This disadvantaged minority (Zureik, 2015) has negative atti- tudes towards people with disabilities (see, for instance, a position paper published by AlManarah and the Arab Association for Human Rights [2013]). It also has a higher rate of deaf and HoH people due to a relatively high prevalence of consanguineous marriages (Shalev, 2018). They thus suﬀer the dou- ble marginalization of being Palestinian in Israel and having a disability in a strongly ableist society. Based on these backgrounds we ask how ableist norms of “hearing” communication contribute to smartphone usage among deaf and HoH Israelis and whether accessible features of the smartphone actually contribute to the social oppression of disabled users. Methods If disability is a product of cultural structures, then its study should take the perspective of disabled people themselves, rather than that of experts speaking on their behalf (Oliver, 1990). Accordingly, this research is based on 20 semi-structured in-depth interviews with deaf and HoH participants. The ﬁrst author, who identities as a HoH person, interviewed 20 people who are located on the medical spectrum of “hearing impairment.” However, the interviewees’ cultural self-deﬁnitions and identities did not necessarily accord with their auditory status. Since the majority of the literature on this popu- lation tends to focus on Deaf people, without giving suﬃcient attention to people who do not identify as Deaf, this research explores a wider range of narratives related to the everyday use of smartphones among deaf and HoH people. Participants were adult Israeli citizens aged between 19 and 72 who own a smartphone, with an equal number of men and women. We created a purposive sample through sequential snowball sam- pling (Teddlie & Yu, 2007). The ﬁrst interviewees were recruited through organizations for deaf and HoH people. The sample included interviewees from diﬀerent parts of the country and from diﬀerent sub-groups of the Israeli population, including one ultra-Orthodox interviewee and two Palestinian citizens of Israel. While we sought to include a range of diﬀerent voices from within Israeli society, a possible limitation of our sample size is limited representativeness, as is often the case with qualitative research of this kind. The interview inquired into diﬀerent phases of the relationship between the individual and their smartphone. It opened with general questions about the interviewees’ communication choices with relatives and friends. We then moved on to the interviewee’s social and emotional narratives around 60 Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone Users N. Bitman & N. A. JohnDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 the event of buying their ﬁrst smartphone, and their initial adjustment to it. Interviewees were then asked about their current experiences (practical and emotional) as a smartphone user with an auditory disability. The ﬁnal part of the interview included questions about auditory status and use of assistive technologies. The audiologic and communicative diversity of the research population required three types of interview. Seventeen were conducted face-to-face at the interviewee’s home or workplace in spoken Hebrew, and one was simultaneously translated into Israeli sign language. These interviews lasted 40–90 minutes. The other two were conducted online through Skype and WhatsApp, in written Hebrew, and took over two hours. The interview methods changed during the research in response to issues of accessibility. Because the ﬁrst author is not ﬂuent in Israeli sign language, the ﬁrst interviewees were recruited according to their ability to perform and understand speech. Otherwise, the presence of a third person—an inter- preter or transcriber—would have been required. We were concerned that having a third, hearing, per- son present in this sensitive situation may have harmed the interview. While it may raise questions about representativeness, this decision nonetheless produced rich interviews. However, it proved impossible to conduct face-to-face, one-on-one interviews with signing Deaf people. Attempts to arrange a signing interpreter failed, either because of scheduling diﬃculties or a lack of motivation among potential interviewees. One interviewee insisted on his hearing daughter simultaneously trans- lating. However, it seems that her presence impacted on his openness, as his answers were terse. Therefore, we conducted two textual interviews via Skype and WhatsApp, based on the interviewees’ preference. It was our aim that the accessibility of the research serve its critical objectives and that it reﬂect the transformative research paradigm, which views the researcher as an agent of social change who promotes equality by entering into dialogue with the research population (Mertens, Sullivan, & Stace, 2011). This is part of an eﬀort to expose cultural constructions of disability and long-standing “positiv- istic” power relations between able-bodied researchers and their disabled subjects (Oliver, 1992). This is not to say that there were no power relations in the interview situation. In particular, as a secular Jewish woman from a prestigious Israeli university, the ﬁrst author’sidentitymay have reproduced in the interview power relations that are prevalent in Israel. For instance, somewhat surprisingly, given its importance within her community, Jasmin, the ultra-Orthodox interviewee, did not bring up the “kosher phone”4 until asked about it at the end of the interview; it is possible that she sought to reinforce the commonalities between herself and the interviewer as HoH people and to downplay a marker of a structural diﬀerence between them. On the other hand, she also seemed to use the interviewer’s “outsider” status in order to make the interview into a safe space for sharing: He [my husband] doesn’t know about my Internet connection, so I don’t need any favors, we’ll do it behind his back. I’m a hearing-impaired person; he’s not. No matter how many times I explain to him [how important the Internet is to me], he won’t understand. (Jasmin, 30) Conducting interviews with the Arab interviewees in Hebrew, at their workplaces, certainly raises questions about power relations and might have placed greater emphasis on their national identities than their identity as disabled. Though Amir and Shadi are of diﬀerent ages and come from diﬀerent cultural environments, they both have family members with more severe hearing loss than them, and from whom they diﬀerentiated themselves. This can be read as an eﬀort to prove their own relative “normalcy” to a Jewish interviewer. We mention these nuanced observations to show how the very issues of intersectionality discussed below were preﬁgured in the interview situation. 61Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 N. Bitman & N. A. John Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone UsersDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 The interviews were analyzed according to the principles of grounded theory (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). The analysis included careful re-readings of each interview and writing memos. In order to highlight the critical perspective of this study, we also used interpretive analysis during the initial cod- ing. Thus, our initial analysis process included the use of a large, theoretically-based conceptual frame- work (Bowen, 2006), which included the use of “sensitizing concepts” (Blumer, 1954). The categories which emerged from these initial codes were developed, creating key categories which were organized around prevalent mobile communication usage, and highlighted the interviewees’ narratives, inten- tions and actions regarding normalizing social norms and inaccessible mobile functions. The careful reﬂexivity emphasized the centrality of power relations during the analysis and enables us to highlight the centrality of intersectionality in the production of knowledge (Winker & Degele, 2011). Findings The voice call was found to be the most signiﬁcant, yet communicatively, socially, and culturally con- ﬂictual use of the smartphone. As we will show, this basic function most fully drew out the narratives of disability, accessibility, communication and compulsory able-bodiedness. Crucially, we found that voice calls and their related communication norms and expectations deeply impacted on the smart- phone’s other functions, especially those perceived as the most accessible, namely, WhatsApp and video calls. This section discusses two themes: ﬁrst, the ways in which deaf and HoH people deal with the expectations of the hearing and/or Deaf community as they adjust their use of WhatsApp and video calls to perceived norms of immediacy and reachability, associated by the interviewees with the perfor- mative norms of voice calls; and second, the way in which people’s responses to the external expecta- tion to perform mobile voice calls reﬂects their identity, communicative choices and auditory status. Together, these themes show how the interviewees’ reported behavior is also a function of the intersec- tion of their audiological capacities and other stigmatized and oppressive positions within the Israeli context. The norms of voice calls and the textual functions of smartphones WhatsApp was a primary channel of communication for the interviewees, whose textual interactions were crucial for creating and maintaining social relationships. It created situations of the kind related by Ariel, a 34-year-old woman, who is not able to perform voice calls: I think that hearing people expect me to reply quickly, right away –“Ariel, we’re in the middle of a discussion, don’t disappear!”—and deaf people know that we exchange messages with ﬁfty thousand other people at a time, so they’re more relaxed (…) Hearing people get annoyed unless I reply (…) because they are so used to the immediacy of voice calls. They tell me that the amount of texting gets them down (…) that it’s really hard for them, so they say, “I wish I could send you recorded [voice] messages on WhatsApp.” (…) but sometimes with men it’s quite cute, like “Wow, Ariel, I’d really like to hear your voice. I miss you.” (Ariel, 34) Ariel attributes an expectation of constant reachability to hearing people; they demand synchro- nicity and that the conversation be given priority, as in a voice call. However, IM’s meaning for deaf and HoH people is diﬀerent. As it is their primary communication medium, they are accustomed to carrying out multiple conversations at the same time, and by and large they do not have the option of resorting to the voice call for matters of greater urgency. Despite smartphones’ visual channel becom- ing increasingly signiﬁcant among hearing people, voice remains important (Ariel, Elishar-Malka, 62 Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone Users N. Bitman & N. A. JohnDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 Avidar, & Levy, 2017), as demonstrated, inter alia, by the desire to send voice messages through WhatsApp. As prevalent as IM may be, voice calls and their associated norms continue to shape expectations of mobile communication. Ariel raises a wider issue of social accessibility, though: Does hearing people’s somewhat begrud- ging agreement to communicate textually really constitute accessibility, given their sometimes authori- tative stance (“don’t disappear!”) and explicitly stated preference for vocal communication? Furthermore, the hearing expectations mentioned by Ariel may represent hearing people’s attempts to include speech and other “natural” elements (Kock, 2005; St. Pierre, 2015) in their new media use, which can have problematic implications for deaf and HoH people and perpetuate the hearing hege- mony (Eckert & Rowley, 2013). These expectations are heightened during Ariel’s romantic interac- tions as a straight single woman; as also mentioned by other straight single female interviewees, potential male partners had a strong preference for vocal communication, possibly because it allows for greater ambiguity (Daft et al., 1987). This desire on the part of hearing men brings into sharp relief the cultural challenges posed by a seemingly accessible technology to women with disabilities, who have to perform “normalcy” and attractiveness (Eichengreen, 2014; Hammer, 2012). Another central function that reﬂects the norms of voice calls, and in particular the expectation that when the phone rings, you’ll answer it, is the video call, which many of the interviewees reported making. Yet their use varied according to their self-deﬁnition and communicative preferences. People who were sometimes able to perform voice calls used video calls less often; when they did, it was usu- ally in order to carry out a more “traditional” audio-visual video call with distant family or friends by adding the possibility of lip-reading. Interviewees who could sign during video calls, however, used them more often as a visual channel for communicating with friends, colleagues, and family. Nonetheless, despite perceptions of video calls as culturally preferred by Deaf users (Cavender et al., 2008), these interviewees reported feeling uncomfortable with the medium. First, 67-year-old Akiva, 42-year-old Abigail and 39-year-old Kobi all stated that it does not really enable accurate lip-reading, and hence full intelligibility (Tran et al., 2015). Second, Abigail and Kobi also raised issues of privacy and bemoaned the lack of an accessible channel between users with diﬀerent communication preferences: If I have to talk with a signing Deaf person and it’s easier for him, I’ll open a video call. But everyone uses WhatsApp (…) I use it with another deaf friend, but we usually read each other’s lips. It’s not as clear as in face to face, my sign language is worse than my Hebrew, and I don’t like to be ﬁlmed—why do I need that? The technology has become much more per- sonal and intimate; you don’t always want others to see you. (Abigail, 42) I feel like I don’t have privacy and I have to be fully aware of the way the camera catches me (…) I only do it because I know that many Deaf people are more comfortable with video (…) I rarely use it, but if I’m talking to signing people it’s easier and the conversation ﬂows. If I have to talk to someone who can’t sign, it’s a big eﬀort for me to lipread. It’s exhausting. (Kobi, 39) Despite the dominance of the visual channel for them, Abigail and Kobi feel uncomfortable with the exposure entailed by video calls and prefer WhatsApp. However, because of a felt social obligation to the Deaf community (Shoham, 2004), they do answer such calls, perhaps also because of potential social sanctions within the community for not doing so (though these are weaker than the sanctions for avoiding voice calls, as we show below). Signing interviewees thus expressed a clear preference for the convenience and intelligibility of WhatsApp over the low ﬁdelity and invasiveness of video calls. To this we would add the Israeli hearing society’s cultural hegemony and its rejection of Israeli sign 63Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 N. Bitman & N. A. John Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone UsersDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 language in favor of medical rehabilitation for deaf and HoH people (Shoham, 2004; cf. Maiorana- Basas & Pagliaro, 2014). Indeed, this might help explain Abigail’s preference for speech over signing. In this section we have started to show the complexity of positions held by our deaf and HoH interviewees towards communication via their smartphone, and the variety of factors that contribute to this complexity. We have seen how various narratives of communication, conceptions of availability and immediacy, and even local culture, shaped interviewees’ decisions about how they use smart- phones to communicate, and the pressure they feel to use certain features, even if they feel uncomfort- able in doing so. We develop this latter idea in the following section. The voice call: choices, responses and passing While previous studies have tended to treat people with various auditory needs as a single category (Maiorana-Basas & Pagliaro, 2014), the mobile voice call vividly brings out the diﬀerences among peo- ple with auditory disabilities. This section thus describes a range of responses to the social expectation of constant reachability via voice call and discusses attitudes towards its performance. These responses and attitudes are analyzed in relation to interviewees’ age, gender, religiosity, nationality and audiolog- ical status, leading us to argue that the intersections in components of interviewees’ identities played a key role in their communicative choices: the fewer intersections with other modes of oppression—or the more social capital interviewees had—the more likely they were to resist the norms of voice calls. In other words, questions of passing—Can I pass as hearing? Shall I even try?—were answered diﬀer- ently by interviewees who occupied diﬀerent subject positions in Israeli society. Let us start with Dudi, a 25-year-old Jewish student who deﬁned himself as “hearing impaired,” and who had been cochlearly implanted after a sudden deafness two years prior to the interview. When asked about making voice calls on his phone, he said: I was recently [cochlearly] implanted, so I got much better (…) Lots of people say that they will call me and stuﬀ. I say that I’d rather they text me, but they say: “Why? I see that you’re talking (…) So why won’t you talk to me on the phone?” And it’s not easy to explain that while I have a cochlear implant, it doesn’t make me a hearing person (…) Look, I can talk on the phone but it takes eﬀort, so I prefer not to (…) unless I have to, but people don’t get it (…) Sometimes I just don’t answer voice calls or explain this to people. If I want people who I care about to understand, I’ll explain: “Listen, I won’t answer your call every single time, you’ll have to send me messages” (…) People know that I don’t want to [talk on the phone]; if all of a sudden they want to, it’s not my problem. Like other of our younger interviewees, Dudi tended to perceive his smartphone and the voice call function quite rationally (“it’s not my problem”), and viewed the demand that he speak on the phone critically (“people don’t get it”). From this position he distinguishes between diﬀerent groups of people and acts diﬀerently with them. Yael, who had been cochlearly implanted as a baby but had been experiencing gradual hearing loss in recent years, provides another example of this social sorting around voice calls alongside a lack of eﬀort to pass. Aged 19 at the time of interview, Yael had recently ﬁnished high school and joined the army. Her newly-attained independence led her to adopt new communicative strategies with her smartphone, which no longer provided suﬃcient auditory intelligibility. As in Dudi’s case, she used the medium as a tool of diﬀerentiation between trusted friends and family members who would be allowed to help her listen to voice calls by repeating what the other person had said and so that she could lipread. This meant she could engage in voice calls when texting was not an option. Dudi, however, raised additional issues. He does not feel obliged to use all of the smartphone’s communicative functions, but makes choices based on his diﬀerentiation between people who respect 64 Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone Users N. Bitman & N. A. JohnDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 his communicative preferences, and people whose calls he will ignore without explanation. Dudi does not let social expectations dictate his communicative habits and resists the strict cultural norms of the hearing hegemony. Indeed, he shifts responsibility back to the hearing society and rejects attempts to communicatively adjust him (Dance & Larson, 1972). We attribute this to his privileged position as a young Jewish man in Israeli society. Dudi and Yael’s shifting auditory status is key to understanding their choices. The dynamic nature of hearing likewise had a profound eﬀect on many interviewees’ mobile communication usage and intensiﬁed the “coming out” dilemma (Samuels, 2003). On the one hand, improved auditory capacities may have incentivized them to seek to attain social capital and avoid stigma by passing and staying in the “closet” (Samuels, 2003); on the other, they continued to experience diﬃculties. Contrastingly, people whose hearing has deteriorated will face greater diﬃculties in passing. This understanding of hearing as dynamic has been largely excluded from the literature, despite its profound impact. Older interviewees were more likely to obey hearing communicative norms and use the function of the voice call in order to pass as hearing. This was especially notable with Reuven, a 56-year-old Jewish man, who has gradually been losing his hearing over the last 30 years. A decade before the interview he had been cochlearly implanted for the ﬁrst time, initiating a dramatic transition from being almost completely deaf to being “slightly HoH,” as he put it. He had experienced audistic stig- mas numerous times, which left a mark: I try not to emphasize that I’m HoH, so that people won’t notice. I only mention it if people are problematic or say something very unclearly. Then I say, “Sorry, could you repeat that?” without explaining why (…) I don’t want to give rise to any stigma (…) Some people, for example, talk from one corner of the room and their hands-free phone is far away (…) nobody, not even a hearing person, could understand what they’re saying. I don’t have a hear- ing problem and I can hear where the person is (…) And then I said: “Please pick up the phone and speak clearly, because I (…)” He asked, “why?” And I replied, “because I can’t hear you well.” And then he said, “I didn’t know that about you (…).” Reuven expresses a need to pass as hearing and mentions his fear of audistic stigma (Humphries, 1977). He pretends to be a hearing person and mentions his diﬃculties only rarely, if there is no choice. Indeed, even when being interviewed by another HoH person, he commented that “nobody, not even a hearing person” would have been able to understand the person on the other end of the phone in the situation he described. Other interviewees did not try to pass as hearing during the inter- view, which suggests particularly aggressive boundary work on Reuven’s part (Yeshua-Katz, 2015). His repeated emphasizing of his excellent hearing may reﬂect his internalization of the normalization of his body (Garland-Thomson, 2002) and compulsory able-bodiedness (Kafer, 2003), while also being an outcome of his personal, audiological and emotional vicissitudes. Thus, ﬁnding someone’s speech unclear during a voice call raised the fear that his invisible disability and communicative deviance from hegemonic expectations would be exposed (Eichengreen et al., 2016) resulting in their over- exposure (Samuels, 2003). For other interviewees, though, the voice call needs to be understood within the context of multi- ple marginalized identities. This is demonstrated by Jasmin, a 30-year-old ultra-Orthodox Jewish woman, who agitatedly described the following scene: My hearing aid was on T position [Telecoil, a designated option for voice calls that silences background noises], and I was talking to someone on my mobile in order to schedule a doc- tor’s appointment. And then (…) [my] babies (…) were crying but I couldn’t hear them, and the woman on the phone, and there was someone else knocking at the door, and I didn’t hear 65Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 N. Bitman & N. A. John Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone UsersDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 either of them (…) and the hearing aid was buzzing (…) It was taking a long time so I eventu- ally told her that I’d call later because I couldn’t do it right then. Then I realized that someone was knocking on the door (…) and it was so embarrassing when I saw it was my brother-in- law (…) I felt so embarrassed because he heard me screaming on the phone and my children crying as well and (…) with all the background noise of my crying children, the phone conver- sation and the knocking on my door, I had no idea that I was yelling so loudly. (Jasmin, 30) This excerpt shows the pressures on Jasmin as a HoH woman in an extremely conservative society: she is expected to take care of her children and manage her household; she wishes to pass as hearing in a society with profoundly stigmatic perceptions of people with disabilities; and she needs to be con- stantly aware of the surveillance that operates within her family and community. Thus, when her brother-in-law drops by, she feels she has been caught red-handed: despite her auditory, cognitive and technical eﬀorts to perform a voice call as one of three diﬀerent auditory tasks, her disability was utterly exposed, leaving Jasmin in an extremely vulnerable position, certainly when compared to other interviewees. While occupying a very diﬀerent position, the experiences of Amir, a 34-year-old male HoH Palestinian citizen of Israel, are also best understood in terms of the intersections of parts of his iden- tity. Amir, who had been cochlearly implanted one year before the interview, and whose brother and sister have more severe hearing loss, said: [Text] messages are a really nice way to communicate, but sometimes you need a phone call as well. There are hard of hearing or deaf people who can’t make voice calls, and that’s ﬁne, so it’s important for them to have a good camera in order to be able to talk face to face. For me, it’s important to have good sound, because I can more or less get by. If I can get by [by turning the volume up] and I can talk, then I can’t give it up. You have to train your brain to do this, to maintain [the ability to understand voice calls] otherwise you lose it (…). (Amir, 34) Amir’s words can be understood as the boundary work of a HoH individual who wishes to avoid stigma by diﬀerentiating himself from Deaf people (Yeshua-Katz, 2015). His approbation of their visual mobile communication, along with his claim that he can make voice calls, express his perceived superiority, and perhaps even a degree of condescension towards “non-rehabilitated hearing- impaired” people (Eichengreen et al., 2016). He is clearly proud of the hard work he continues to invest in functioning “normally.” We suggest, however, that Amir’s indirect, yet unmistakable, criticism of deaf and HoH people, may also echo negative social perceptions in Arab society of deaf and HoH people (AlManarah, 2013). Despite his close relationships with his siblings, he stresses that his hearing is better. His proud description in the rest of the interview of how he is able to make voice calls to help them can be under- stood as boundary work aimed at avoiding the additional stigma of his Arab culture while being inter- viewed by a Jewish Israeli, and thus as reﬂective of the intersectionality of his marginalized identities in Israel. Amir’s interview reﬂects not only his internalization of medical and audistic norms (“it’s not the smartphone to blame; the hearing is the problem,” he said in the interview), but also the connection between personal and technological aspects of “brain training.” He described at length how he learned to synchronize his new auditory condition with his smartphone by choosing a hearing aid that would make voice calls intelligible to him. As mentioned by Jasmin, accessible features of smartphones, and their pairing with assistive technologies (e.g., cochlear implants, Telecoil position on hearing aids) are crucial for passing and the avoidance of stigma. 66 Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone Users N. Bitman & N. A. JohnDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 Some interviewees had no choice but to completely forgo voice calls due to auditory inability. They too faced issues of accessibility, dependence, and personal conﬂict with the strict communicative norms of hearing society, yet had more extreme experiences. We can understand the scope of their exclusion through Kobi’s experience as a Deaf man: When does my mobile not help me? When people are still unable to understand what access- ibility means. For example, a month ago, I needed a plumber. I had to text thirty people until someone ﬁnally replied, and I only took him because he was available, even though he was charging too much. The refusal of various service providers to communicate in an accessible way creates a dependency among Deaf people on others, such as hearing partners, parents, children or friends. This lack of inde- pendence leads to greater isolation, showing how social inaccessibility can serve to heighten exclusion and social oppression. Sometimes, though, Deaf people seem almost to see these situations as given, as suggested by Kobi’s reference to hearing people’s “inability to understand what accessibility means,” instead of pointing to structural social inaccessibility and the role of the hearing hegemony in sustain- ing it. As a gay, Deaf man, Kobi is positioned further from the center of Israeli society than Dudi, for example; this may explain his hesitancy to attribute responsibility to an inaccessible society that ignores his communicative rights and makes him dependent on his hearing environment. Discussion and conclusions Our ﬁndings show how our interviewees use their smartphones to gain social capital, while also show- ing how those interviewees positioned at the intersections of multiple marginalized groups are more negatively aﬀected by media technologies than users whose only source of oppression is their disabil- ity. This leads us to understand individual practices in relation to wider hegemonic communicative and cultural norms and values. First, we found that even smartphone users who are not auditorily able to perform voice calls still experienced strong pressure to comply with its norms of communication. Thus, WhatsApp conversa- tions with hearing people, who might mention how tiring all this texting could get, were expected to be as immediate as voice calls, and video calls were experienced by some Deaf interviewees as an inva- sive obligation. These sources of personal and collective limitations and their communicative, cultural and personal impact on deaf and HoH Israelis reveal the centrality of voice calls not only as a practice, but as a technological instantiation of the cultural ideal of vocal communication. Second, the interviewees had diﬀerent responses and attitudes to the expectation to perform voice calls which are best understood from an intersectional perspective. This perspective not only takes users’ auditory status into account, but their other marginalized identities too. Many of the intervie- wees with additional marginalized identities (because of their age, sexuality, nationality, or religiosity) make great eﬀorts to live up to the expectation to make voice calls, and even use this function of the smartphone in order to pass as hearing and attain social capital. HoH people’s practice of distinguish- ing themselves from Deaf people and avoiding “coming out” as disabled is a speciﬁc kind of boundary work that has not yet been reported in the context of disability media studies. We believe this leads us to an important theoretical contribution to understanding computer-mediated communication use. Moreover, enforced normalcy (Davis, 1995) and the stigmatization of the use of assistive technology (Ellis & Kent, 2011) leads to the social exclusion of deaf and HoH people. Thus, the mobile voice call becomes a mechanism of oppression. 67Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 N. Bitman & N. A. John Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone UsersDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/24/2/56/5299215 by guest on 23 August 2024 In contradistinction to the medical perspective, our ﬁndings show deaf and HoH people to be extremely diverse and complex smartphone users. Our analysis of the tensions between various deaf and HoH narratives, which have largely been ignored by other studies, highlights society’s role and users’ cultural background in shaping communicative uses of the smartphone among deaf and HoH people. These uses may make them feel uncomfortable, disrupt their communicative narrative, and are even contrary to their accessibility needs. As a result, the potential accessibility of the smartphone is crowded out by its reproduction of communicative oppression. We believe this ﬁnding provides a meaningful theoretical contribution to the way we theorize media use by marginalized groups. This article shows how structural narratives of disability, communication and technology inform personal experiences with smartphones. More speciﬁcally, the practice of the voice call emerges as a technological reﬂection of media richness theories (Daft et al., 1987; Kock, 2005), which ultimately support hegemonic ableism (St. Pierre, 2015; Humphries, 1977). As such, this hangover from the fea- ture phone enables us to examine current oppressive patterns of communication, even among those who do not use it at all. The stress experienced by Deaf and HoH users around voice calls has migrated to textual and visual interactions, perpetuating the ideal of “natural” communication as rooted in vocal speech both in hearing society, with its potential for stigmatizing, and by the Deaf community, which has maybe internalized stigmas as a tool of Deaf pride and culture. Thus, going beyond our speciﬁc research site, we suggest that social and cultural circumstances will shape the behaviors of people with diﬀerent communication needs in other societies. Our intersectional analysis revealed speciﬁc groups as more likely to have the privilege to resist the strict cultural communicative expectations of smartphone usage: Jewish, young and secular HoH men. National and religious minorities, as well as women and older people, made greater eﬀorts to live up to ableist communicational expectations. This has a surprising implication: features for access- ibility on smartphones, and the way they work in conjunction with hearing devices and assistive tech- nologies, would seem to enable HoH people to pass more successfully as hearing. However, their lengthy and ongoing attempts to make these technical combinations work properly indicate their exclusion from the smartphone’s design process (Akrich, 1992; Wijetunga, 2014), despite its being marketed as accessible. Though we had only a few interviewees from marginalized religious and national groups and do not claim to generalize from them, we maintain that it is their intersectional experience that accounts for their reported smartphone use. Further, we argue that this intersectional perspective is critical in the context of media use by people with disabilities (see also Alper, 2017), and call for further studies that may shed light on how the social, cultural, and communicative contexts of diﬀerent societies structure intersectional identities and thereby shape smartphone use. The theoretical integration of disability and communication studies oﬀered here enables us to see the smartphone as one part of an inaccessible technological and communicative environment. As such, our analysis oﬀers a deeper understanding of the ways that normalizing communicative norms aﬀect the personal experiences, perceptions and identities of people with disabilities. Thus, this research contributes to the growing ﬁeld of disability media studies. Finally, this study demonstrates the scale of social control when it comes to individuals’ personal use of their smartphone. As shown in this article, disabled people who are members of marginalized groups will strive to pass as having other advantageous identities. Thus, future research should focus on the complex relationship between the individual and “personal” new media devices or practices among people with disabilities. Given what we know about online inequality for disabled users, future research in this regard may focus on the disabled individual’s motives, narratives and social survival on social media. An appropriate qualitative method would allow for a deep examination of the per- sonal behavior of disabled people during their everyday use of media, and might show how digital 68 Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 24 (2019) 56–72 Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone Users N.

Moreover, such a method may promote accessible qualita- tive research beﬁtting of academic discourses of inclusivity.
