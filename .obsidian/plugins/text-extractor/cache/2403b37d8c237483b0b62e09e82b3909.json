The truth is, though, we have all struggled and probably even failed at being compassionate in some capacity at some point in our lives. One area that I think this may be true for many is adult children struggling to find compassion for an aging parent who has traumatized them. This struggle for compassion has a spectrum of difficulty depending on the current physical and mental state of the parent, the amount of care needed, and the depth of trauma they suffered in childhood. Can you forgive the parent, accepting that they did the best they could with the tools they had at that time, yet still resent them- dislike them even? Add to this inherent resentment a list of chores, doctor's appointments, grocery store trips, baths, and diaper changes, and the all too familiar attitude that you owe this to them… Anyone who has been in this situation has at least at some point felt like giving up and walking away, leaving their aging parent to be someone else’s problem. But the interesting thing is that very few people, if any, walk away. Most people, some who would admit to a confidant that they hated their parent growing up, and sometimes still do- stay and often sacrifice their own needs, health, and well- being to care for their aging parent until the parent dies. This is usually seen as a noble act- people will tell you you’re a saint- especially if they know anything about your difficult childhood. Maybe that’s part of why we do it. Nothing better adorns the fragile ego than a crown of martyrdom. It’s a complex mix of pride and shame that keeps traumatized adult children caring for their aging parental traumatizers. We so often hear, “If I don’t do it, no one else will.”- this observation doesn’t sound much like it comes from a compassionate place, and years of this level of sacrifice for someone whose behavior left you with scars so deep, you’re still dealing with them in therapy, changes you. I live in Maine in the town I grew up in, where I experienced a massive amount of trauma, because this is where my parents live, and I am their only close living relative. I go to USM because it’s convenient to where I live, even though it does not offer the major I’d like, and the program for what I’m most passionate about studying is almost non-existent. My parents are in their seventies. My mother has struggled with some significant health issues over the last five years, and due to their traditionally toxic patriarchal relationship dynamic, my father doesn’t really know how to care for himself outside of working and making money. While we all have the choice to handle what life throws at us in different ways, and I can recognize I made some bad choices as a teenager, my parents played an extremely significant role in why I missed out on getting a high school education and waited over twenty years to go to college. I am now in my second year of college with a 4.0 GPA and the understanding that getting an education is the most wonderful and important thing one can do for oneself. I can no longer move and go to whatever school best supports my educational goals- some would say I’m no longer in an appropriate position to attend full-time at all. It’s difficult not to feel I have been robbed of something, and if I had been shown compassion in childhood by the same caregivers who now expect it from me, I would be living a very different life. I struggle almost daily with being a compassionate daughter and caregiver to my parents, and while I wouldn’t express this to them, I am not ashamed to admit it. Zeinab Hassan Posted Feb 6, 2025 1:39 PM Hi Esther. You brought up some significant and pressing issues that affect many people. Your point about some people having to find compassion and use their imagination to help their aging parent who they may not necessarily have a great relationship with is a really good example of how difficult it can be to find compassion when there are other crucial aspects involved in one's feelings. You explained everything very thoroughly! Tucker Bradford Posted Feb 9, 2025 9:40 AM • 193 Words Gah! I love the vulnerability of your post. I also wrote about the struggle to find compassion, but I came at it from a different angle. I am intrigued by the unanswered question you pose as well. I have not yet had to care for an aging parent, but my parents brought my grandfather (who was similarly deprived by the patriarchy of self-sufficiency) in after my grandmother died. He slipped into dementia and the stories they tell me of what that was like feel so much like preparation, that I have often imagined myself in their role. Like you, my childhood left some unresolved trauma, also like you, I have returned to school after an extended hiatus, and find it to be rewarding and important to my development into my ideal self. These similarities perhaps make your accounting of caregiving easier to imagine than my parent's cautionary tales. So back to that unanswered question. Is it \"Nothing better adorns the fragile ego than a crown of martyrdom.\" or compassion that motivates your caregiving? If it's not so simple, I would love to hear more over a cup of coffee some time! Thank you!","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
