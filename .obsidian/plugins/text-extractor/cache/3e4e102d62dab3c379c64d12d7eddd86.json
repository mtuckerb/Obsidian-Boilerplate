They challenge our mental processing, in part because systems can’t be bigots and institutions can’t be prejudiced. And so I offer a modest proposal, but an earnest one. How about revising our terms for “systemic racism,” “structural racism” and “institutional racism”? The problem with these phrases is that systems, structures and institutions cannot be racist any more than they can be happy or sad. They can be made up of individuals who share these traits, or even have procedures that may engender them. But systems, structures and institutions do not themselves have feelings or prejudices. Yes, of course, we use these terms in a more abstract way: The idea is that the inequities between races that systems can harbor are themselves racist. They are a different form of racism than personal bias. But we must learn this usage of racism in the same way that we learn we aren’t supposed to say “Tom and me talked” as opposed to “Tom and I talked.” It is a hallmark of the modern enlightened American to understand that systems can “be racist.” But deep down I suspect many cannot help but ask, if only in flashlight-under-the-pillow style: Isn’t bias different from inequality, and why are we using one word to refer to both? Calling for people to stop saying this or that almost never has any real effect, and overall, linguists like me delight in the changes we hear around us. Plus, things people decry as confusing in language usually are not. Context is key: You probably have no problem with the fact that a rabbit can run “fast,” but that in the idiom “stuck fast” the word suddenly means the opposite. But the terms “systemic racism,” “structural racism” and “institutional racism” can be seen as different in that they sow a kind of confusion — just as “sanction” meaning both to approve and to penalize does, especially among lawyers, from what I am told. We are to understand a pathway running through, first, racism as bias, then bias causing inequalities and thus leaving in its wake a different rendition of “racism.” But in actuality, using this word enables an attitude that can be less than constructive. I once had a conversation with a Black woman who lived near a school in a mostly Black, low-income neighborhood whose students were almost all kids of other races from other neighborhoods. The school required a certain test score for admission. The woman referred to the school as “straight-up racist” in that almost no kids from the neighborhood attended it. But this is a highly stretched usage of the word. The low number of Black kids in that school is something we need to fix. But it is probably safe to say that no one in the school would disagree — the reason for the low numbers is not anyone’s bigotry.

And here’s the thing. One might formally understand that, but the set-jawed anger many, such as this woman, have about “systemic racism” is not anger at 1960. It is, even if tacitly, based on a sense that this systemic racism is a present-tense phenomenon — i.e., that what we must battle is something going by the name of “racism” that exists in the here and now and both enrages and disgusts us. And in its true sense, it should. But what will get more Black kids into schools like the one this person was referring to here and now, in the present, are things like getting the word out about test preparation, changing the way poor kids are taught how to read and making good charter schools available to as many underprivileged kids as possible. These things have little to do with going out and battling the evil face of racist bias. Similarly, it helps little to call a test on which racial groups differ in their performance a “racist” test. It is unlikely that anyone connected to the test is committed to keeping Black people from passing it, even if the reasons for the differential in pass rates are rooted in the effects of past racism. Labeling Black English speakers as linguistically deficient is something we call “systemic racism” — with even me bowing to the convention not long ago when I wrote about it — despite the fact that there is no reason to think that anyone designing or administering the tests is racist; they often even suppose they are helping rather than hurting Black kids. What we call environmental racism also profoundly affects poor whites as well, and it can also be viewed as a class phenomenon based on a disregard for people without power, whatever color they are. The disparity in criminal sentencing for possession of powder versus crack cocaine certainly affected Black people disproportionately. However, calling this systemic racism cannot help but call to mind bigoted officials punishing Black people out of racist contempt when, in reality, many leaders in the Black community ardently supported these laws. Terms like “systemic racism” are not utterly without use. For one, of course there are actual racists embedded in some segments of American society, not to mention less overt, yet intolerable, racism of subtler kinds. For example, the idea among medical practitioners that Black people are more tolerant of pain than others is a kind of racist bias whose effects spread throughout the medical system. The fact that cops are more likely to rough up Black people cannot be treated as anything other than a “systemic” manifestation of underlying dehumanization. But such cases are exceptions. Most disparities between Black and white people, though they exist and are not something Black people deserve any kind of blame for, are not due in 2022 to “racism” in any sense compatible with clear and honest language.

Calling systems, structures and institutions “racist” encourages a kind of anthropomorphization of abstract matters, which is a simplistic and even unscientific mode kind of thought. However, I am arguing not from any authority one might associate with my being a linguist. I am pretty sure quite a few linguists will disagree with me on this. I am simply seeking a clearer and less unnecessarily loaded way of talking about racism and how we actually help people in a society riddled with inequality. Calling inequities between races “systemic racism” and the like gets in the way of that. I think of a hypothetical people founding a town long ago, among whom acrophobia — i.e., fear of heights — was unusually common. They restricted buildings to being two stories high at most. In subsequent generations, as the population grew both locally and from immigration, acrophobia largely faded away. However, this had always been a town with limited funds, and the two-story limit has led to significant overcrowding. Imagine the town leaders making sonorous speeches referring to overcrowding and its attendant ills — below-average schools, crime, pollution — as “acrophobia” because that’s what they were traceable to in the past. You could wrap your head around using the term that way if necessary. But that would also interfere with clear and constructive discussion about what to do about the problems. From now on, I, for one, will be referring to most of the things we are now taught to call systemic racism as being “inequities between races.” In my ideal universe, the term would quickly and inevitably be shortened to just “inequities,” with a tacit reference to Black and Latino people, just as “minority” now has the same implication. We would battle these inequities, but without the lexical mission creep which has led to how confusingly we use the word “racism” now. Less distracted by the fantasy that these inequities are embodiments of an undying bigotry in “institutional” form, we could focus more attention on genuine solutions to what is holding back real people in today’s America.
