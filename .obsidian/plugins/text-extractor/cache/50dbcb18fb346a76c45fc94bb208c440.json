Conceived and developed in the writings of Molefi Kete Asante, Ama Mazama, Linda James Myers, Maulana Karenga, Ruth Reviere, and others, Afrocentricity has become the dominant theoretical method in the critique and examination of African and African American phenomena. This has thrown it into discourse with prominent theories and philosophies that have emerged from the European context.

There is one common trait of the criticism of traditional historiography in the assumptions embedded in these two questions. It is the criticism of the classical theorists - that I contend - for whom the end of the colonial empires and the collapse of the European Enlightenment paradigm was a synonym for either the disorder or end of a long-time process of evolution; it is the notion that with postmodernism we had come to the end of history as the end of a process beyond which only second-rate ideologies would be possible, where there would not be room for any sort of ideology or further progress, as defended by Ju'rgen Habermas (1962/1991). It opposed the so- called French School theory that, following Frangois Lyotard (1979/1984), embodied the collapse of the concept of grand narratives, or metanarratives, as bastions of Western thought. Besides the alarming nihilism purported by classical social theory, Lyotard's idea stands for another postmodernist perspective. Actually, the rupture of a so- called preordained order does not mean that we have come to the end of history in the sense that no more progress for humankind will be achieved. It is clear that what was once taken for granted in the Western paradigm - a linear con- cept of history, of time, and of progress - was illusory. The fact that this illu- sion cannot persist does not annul the future. Instead, as Kumar (2000) says, A more generative approach is marked by those who conceive the end of a pre-ordained order as a new beginning, as an acknowledgement, as perhaps never before, of the interconnection and interdependence of the societies that make up the global system, (pp. 57-59) Consequently, one may argue that both Afrocentricity and postmodernism are new beginnings, with differences, however. Afrocentricity has established itself as the most recent breach of the fash- ionable theories addressing present-day critical issues such as postcolonial theory, multiculturalism, and critical race theory. Afrocentricity emerged as a new order of principles coming out of the questioning of old certainties and the hegemonic Western universalism in the effort to understand our present multicultural social condition. However, while postmodernism reacts to the framework of classical social theory supported by a sense of the Western historical timeline and against the \"divinely\" preordained order that grounds Fukuyama's interpretative fears of nihilism, Afrocentricity emerged in the African American cultural panorama as a set of premises that would account for the understanding of an African sense of totality and wholeness in a network of multiple and particular man- ifestations of different fields of human experience.

Any attempt to embrace the advancement of knowledge about the multicul- tural condition, which impregnates both history and life experience in the United States of America, credits the act of questioning the hegemonic views of main- stream literary critics and the values of the American literary tradition from a nondominant standpoint, which is the argument and the focus of this essay. Epistemological Cofoundation With the movement known as the Harlem Renaissance, the literary panorama in America has evolved in terms of a permanent incorporation of art forms that have definitely contributed to a steady blurring of frontiers between literary categories as defined by the Western canon. The relevance of the exchanging of myths and aesthetical values between \"the center and the margins\" - in the Eurocentric perspective - has been forcing the reinter- pretation of the Western literary history where literary theory, criticism, and history were discussed as separate and distinct topics. It has also triggered new interpretative paradigms - like Afrocentricity and postmodernism - that question modernism, elitism, the Western canon, and the ideological centrality of a \"true Enlightening\" American democracy. These reflections have caused me to view Afrocentricity and postmod- ernism as useful instruments in reordering epistemology. Instead of viewing them as opposites, I contend that these two paradigms might coexist in a par- allel critical approach to the American art panorama of the second half of the 20th century, be it literature, music, plastic art, culture, or the media, espe- cially if we accept the idea that Afrocentricity and postmodernism have found their roots in two major movements in the arts and literature that flour- ished in America during the same period, at the dawn of the 20th century: modernism and the Harlem Renaissance. One could argue, however, that Afrocentricity was more soundly expressed in the depths of the Black arts movement of the 1960s and 1970s rather than in the Harlem Renaissance. As an expression of independence and agency, the Black arts movement, as interpreted by Larry Neal, Charles Fuller, Amiri Baraka, and Maulana Karenga, was a nascent centric response to marginality. Nevertheless, the inspiration may be said to be that of the Harlem Renaissance to some extent. The Harlem Renaissance, often thought of as the epic movement of Black arts, embodied the pursuit, in all its forms and expressions, of the conceptual, This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000130.111.28.95 on Sat, 24 Aug 2024 13:59:41 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 330 Journal of Black Studies spiritual, cultural, and aesthetic values of the African people that had been almost completely annihilated for centuries, especially during the enslaved period, in America (Chapman, 1968/2001). Unlike some critics, who tend to give a decentered definition of the movement as a resurrection of the autonomous African American individual, I would like to emphasize the fact that the concept of individuality attached to \"the autonomous African American individual\" is completely out of the scope of the African cos- mogony and would, therefore, call the reader's attention to the need of a crit- ical nondominant standpoint where the hegemonic Eurocentric structures of domination would be served by a postmodern deconstructive approach. Modernism, which sprang out of the rejection of the Victorian authority and tradition, placed a strong emphasis on the autonomous \"enlightened\" individual and on his or her reasoning capabilities by whose exercise a lin- ear progress of the so-called real world and the essence of Truth would be achieved (Pires, 2004). That these two movements flourished in the United States and Europe roughly during the same period, the early decades of the 20th century into the 1940s and 1950s, and that African, African American, American, and European artists, writers, musicians, playwrights, and poets cohabited and shared their knowledge and experiences in Harlem (New York) as well as in Europe - mainly in Paris, London, Berlin, and Rome (Pells, 1997) - seems to me to be one more reason to support a parallel analysis of both Afrocentricity and postmodernism. Actually, modernism and the Harlem Renaissance, as artistic move- ments, have been treated so far as separate and independent spheres by crit- ical theory: the Harlem Renaissance at best considered as an isolated island, appropriated by the panorama of American art of the 20th century at large as a colorful variation in the Eurocentric paradigm of an American melting pot for the benefit and enjoyment of an affluent White American society, intellectuals and cultural politicians alike. But it conceals another reality. When European and American intellectuals faced the despair of the chaos after World Wars I and II, a first wave of modern writers and poets, critics, and philosophers, such as Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, and many others, fascinated by and eager to adopt the avant-garde intellectual atmosphere of Paris and London, traveled and lived in Europe. During World War II and in its aftermath, they were fol- lowed by a second wave of intellectual commuters, now many European intellectuals, who found in American universities, especially around New York, a safe place to live and work away from the persecutions suffered in Europe.

The Harlem Renaissance was an enormous international intellectual achieve- ment. During the Harlem Renaissance, both Black and White artists experienced the unique atmosphere and the rich variety of African American imagination and expression. The dramatic qualities of African American folktales added so much vibrancy, energy, and life to the economy of the novel; advanced the poetic and rhythmic qualities of the spirituals; and demonstrated the pathos of African people in American culture and literature and as an incomparable source of artis- tic consciousness and sensibility (Chapman, 1968/2001, p. 22). However, there has been a pattern in American society where the works of African Americans are not generally accepted into the canon. Thus, one sees that much of African American writing was unknown to the general reading public and little known even to students of American literature and culture until the emergence of Black Studies in the 1960s (Chapman, 1968/2001, pp. 24-25). Actually, Eurocentric scholars and critics - from Rene Wellek and Austin Warren (1956) to Harold Bloom (1994), who regarded as a universal reference their hegemonic views of mainstream literary critics - followed the Western canon and devalued any expression of Black art as minor and ethnic, despite the fact that their own work was ethnic. They labeled African and African American literature and art as mere folklore and criticized Black nov- els as lacking theme and character development, while the use of African expressions in live dialogues was seen as sloppy and its author as unskilled. This state of affairs explains the climate of indifference, neglect, or rejection by which African American literature remained banned from many schools and college curricula in American studies in Europe and theoretical curricula in the United States. At the same time, the modern romantic image of the lone creative artist was being abandoned and modernist elitism rejected following the new philosophic and critical theories of Nietzsche, Lyotard, and Foucault, among others, who claimed the \"death of God\" in the Western cosmologi- cal order and placed the reasoning man at its center. Consequently, \"the death of the author\" created such an epistemological bouleversement that the liberation of Eurocentric thought from the authority that legitimated its purist, universal, and imperialist tendencies could only be expected. In this sense, the deconstructive effort that characterizes postmodernism has been its greatest methodological achievement.

This is precisely, from my point of view, the greatest achievement of postmodern thought. However, we must not forget that it is Eurocentric in both its logic and foundations. Postmodern and Afrocentric Challenges The foundational truth established by the tradition of a linear concept of time and experience was overturned by postmodernism as cultural rela- tivism replaced both the modern autonomous individual and the power of human reason. Actually, the grand narratives representing the \"triumph of human reason,\"1 crucial to the process of \"legitimation\" of the Western philosophical thought of the Enlightenment, lost their ability to ensure per se the respect for human rights and the expansion of human liberty. As Lyotard (1979/1984) sees it, postmodernism brings \"incredulity towards and a deep suspicion of the totalizing sense of such narratives\" (p. xxiii). Simultaneously, the search for the collective distinctive values of the different experiences of numerical minorities, the impact of the flourish- ing culture of African Americans as well as the histories of women, and all the complex historical relationships of social protest and liberal academic discourses contributed to bring about the dissolution of dichotomous and hierarchical distinctions. To account for the merging of the experiences of the subject and the object and of the voices unheard so far, scholars and crit- ics had to look for new paradigms that would give evidence of the multiple and particular manifestations in different fields of knowledge: from litera- ture to architecture, to history, to social science and politics, with a strong emphasis on the new field of cultural studies, which had been at the heart of African American thought since Alain Locke and the Harlem Renaissance. From Jakobson's structuralism to Derrida's deconstruction, through theo- ries of the subject (the self in a social context) and very much through the influence of the abolitionist movements, feminist historians and scholars con- tributed to blurring the effect of cultural boundaries. The Western grand nar- ratives, both mythological and historical, lost their omniscient truth in favor of the multiplicity of the different perspectives of nonhegemonic voices. On the other hand, the opening up to the acceptance of difference, of the hidden subject, against the grain of the establishment of hegemonic colonial powers, was backed up by the emergence of two fundamental par- adigms: structuralism and deconstruction. Following Saussure (1916/1972) and the foundations of linguistics as a science, Jakobson (1990) and his This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000130.111.28.95 on Sat, 24 Aug 2024 13:59:41 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Monteiro-Ferreira / Af rocentricity 333 followers developed and applied to literature, anthropology, politics, and culture the linguistic notion of structure. This was also applied to the social sciences; structuralism conferred social phenomena, regarded like a lan- guage system, the same relational value as linguistic phenomena. Actually, the set of rules that account for both the achievements and transformations, and the power relationships in the interior of the structure itself, as well as the way they are organized, can be explained by the disruptions and con- nections established by the set of oppositions and identifications between their elements (Derrida, 1982). That only by the deconstructive analysis of Western discourse will these power relations be clearly evinced makes, in my opinion, of this postmodern methodology one of the founding most rel- evant steps and an irrefusable tool in literary, social, and cultural critique. In the sense that they problematize the totalizing and hegemonic per- spective of Eurocentric knowledge, postmodern theories and methodologies must be regarded as companions to Afrocentricity. In fact, Afrocentricity, which emerged as a theory under Asante's (1980) methodological systemati- zation of the teachings of African predecessors, scholars, writers, poets, and intellectuals such as W. E. B Du Bois,2 Marcus Garvey, Cheikh Anta Diop, Langston Hughes, Harold Cruse, Malcolm X, Ida B. Wells, and George James, is primarily concerned with the agency of African people as subjects instead of objects of history. Most important, Afrocentricity, unlike Eurocentric theories, does not bear a totalitarian spirit because it does not seek to replace \"white knowledge\" with \"black knowledge\" (Asante, 1998, p. xi). On the contrary, being a frontal critique of every sort of prejudice and racist theory, of every hegemonic and totalizing paradigm Afrocentricity - a theory of wholeness - seeks ways of unity based on mutual respect for the cultural agency of all Black and White people. In this respect, let me quote its found- ing theorist: \"The Afrocentric idea is projected as a model for intercultural agency in which pluralism exists without hierarchy and respect for cultural origins, achievements, and prospects is freely granted\" (Asante, 1998, p. xii). This also means that Afrocentricity must not be taken for Afrocentrism - Afrocentricity is a theory not a religion, as many of its detractors claimed. In fact, Afrocentric theory seeks neither a totalizing nor a universal scope. It does not set itself up as a universal standard and does not criticize Eurocentrism in its particularity. What Afrocentric theory requires is \"loca- tion,\" African location as the methodological approach to African traditions and cultures while refusing the subaltern place that has always been conferred to Black artistic and cultural expressions by Eurocentric scholars. Like Asante (1998), who has been trying to demonstrate that there is no loss of values in the African American community, so am I suggesting that This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000130.111.28.95 on Sat, 24 Aug 2024 13:59:41 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 334 Journal of Black Studies those critics (like West or Wellek) who reclaim both postmodernism and Afrocentricity to have produced either \"the highest level of self-destruction\" or \"nihilism,\" share the same biased segregating concepts. In sympathy with the ongoing critique of institutional practice and the polemic against the purist and imperialist tendencies of Western thought, which grounds and centers the discourse in an original author, postmod- ernist rejection of the authority of the grand narratives as an unchallenged and universally accepted truth seems to me to be one of the ways we have to move forward and achieve progress in knowledge and understanding of difference. Another way we have to achieve such a generative force is through the recognition that both Afrocentric theory and postmodernism promote a creative self-criticism of entrenched and fixed positions as a process that could enable people in different research traditions to find the subjects of different cultures subjects of human history. Therefore, an Afrocentric analysis is not incompatible with a postmodern approach to the work of art. Quite the contrary, I believe that by running par- allel ways they can enrich each other's methodologies and insights; I believe that instead of crystallizing in opposing perspectives and unchallenged dog- matism, a serious investigation of the conceptual foundations would reveal the potential to create a generative dialogue between the two paradigms. As a philosophical, social, and cultural theory committed to the construc- tion of an African-centered holistic paradigm and an all encompassing inter- disciplinary methodology supported by a rigorous and constant awareness of location that calls for the agency of African people, Afrocentric methodology can, for research purposes, be arranged in three basic categories or paradigms: â¢ the functional paradigm, regarding the need for action, political or social (Mazama, 2003); â¢ the categorical paradigm, including a range of analytical concepts and categories such as race, ethnicity, gender, and class; and â¢ the etymological paradigm, concerning language structures, concepts behind words, and families of words as the expression of a common cultural heritage. As a cultural theory, Afrocentricity is committed to the reconstruction of ancient African classical civilizations as the place for interpreting and under- standing the history of African peoples, narratives, myths, spirituality, and cosmogonies. The ancient African civilizations did not separate religion and philosophy and their contributions to art, literature, and science were directly connected to the principles of ancient wisdom, so the African world sense, cosmogonies, institutions, concepts, symbols, and voices can only be fully perceived and appreciated through a holistic paradigm like Afrocentricity.

And because African aesthetic creative forces are never dissociated from real life and from an African axiological pattern, where the highest ethical value is the human responsibility to prevent chaos, a decon- structive approach to everyday discourses will provide the critic with the ability to locate a text as the means to a real and deeper understanding of the African pathos and of the aesthetic and philosophical dimensions that under- lie the interplay of different African rhythms and subject matters. Conclusion \"African art is never art pour I' art; it is always functional\" Asante (1998) explains (p. 75). By the same token, Afrocentricity requires agency and a conception of the human being that is liberating. Together with the postmodern process of deconstruction, in as far as it poses a severe criti- cism over the preponderant Eurocentric myths of universalism and dis- misses the colonizing concepts and racist theories that preside over the triumph of Western thought, Afrocentricity can open the possibility of a nonhegemonic alternative perspective in the understanding of human expressions in our diverse multicultural society. All the more when we can trace a few similarities that should lead our efforts to a creative association between the two paradigms: â¢ their common heritage that emerges from modernism and the Harlem Renaissance (the Black arts movement); â¢ the critique of any hegemonic perspective and dogmatic commitment; â¢ the critique of any methodology that objects to searching for knowledge from different perspectives; â¢ the critique of any normative Truth as a universal paradigm; â¢ the sense that any manifestation of art must be seen as a product of social, historical, and linguistic, as well as nonindividual, determinants that we call expressions of culture; â¢ the nonhierarchical recognition of every cultural subject; and â¢ the critique of any oppressive paradigm, be it race, ethnicity, gender, or class.
