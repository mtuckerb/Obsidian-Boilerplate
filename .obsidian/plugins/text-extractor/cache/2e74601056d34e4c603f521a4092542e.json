Tucker Bradford Dr. Sandra Dutkowsky PHI-275 5 May 2025 This is How You Lose the Time War: A Compassion Based Analysis This essay explores how This is How You Lose the Time War embodies the philosophical concepts introduced in Professor Dutkowsky’s course “The Nature of Compassion.” In, Compassion and Moral Guidance, Steve Bein establishes 8 Conditions on which Compassion must stand in order to be a basis for moral judgment and action. I will describe how the protagonists demonstrate adherence to many of these conditions. One of the most confounding conditions from a Western perspective is the 4th; “It must recognize from its very roots the irreducible relationality of human existence” (Bein (49). Bein uses Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist philosophies to demonstrate how a ﬁeld of selves (aka great-self, or anatmān) effectively surmounts this condition, and I will take that one step further in this essay to demonstrate how irreducible relationality can be articulated in not just space, but time as well. The novella opens on a battleﬁeld. The protagonists (Red and Blue) are disembodied players in a game which has claimed the life of an entire planet: Both armies lie dead. Two great empires broke themselves here, each a reef to the other’s hull. That is what she came to do. From their ashes others will rise, more suited to her Agency’s ends. And yet. There was another on the ﬁeld—no groundling like the time-moored corpses mounded by her path, but a real player. Someone from the other side. This perspective is narrated by Red, an agent of Technology (though this is only implied in the story). Her adversary (Blue) is an agent of Nature (also implied). As Red contemplates her opponent, she acknowledges the role she has played in the carnage, and how it might all be for naught if this opposing player escapes. As she does, she 9 10 6 1 2 Page 4 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 Page 4 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 2 demonstrates the ﬁrst compassionate overture of the story.\"Killing gets easier with practice, in mechanics and technique. Having killed never does.\" In those 4 words, we learn that Red holds compassion as an ethically primary trait, and that (in some small way) her compassion for the planet she has killed has impacted her—in other words, is capable of generating personally directed imperatives—and that it encompasses all those worthy of moral consideration (Bein 49). Most importantly, in this passage, Red expresses her eudaimonistic judgment (Bein 44). \"having killed never does,\" exposes Red's grief at the suffering she has caused, and the dissonance that has arisen in her as a result. In this ﬁrst page, the protagonist fulﬁlls 3 of the 8 conditions that Bein requires, speciﬁcally that compassion be: an ethically primary trait; capable of generating personally directed imperatives; encompassing of all those worthy of moral consideration. Bein argues that for compassion to provide guidance, the subject must be capable of generating personally directed imperatives. Put another way, the trait must help a person to know what they must do based solely on compassionate guidance. An ethically primary trait is one that can stand on its own as the sole means of guidance. In the context of this story, Red (and Blue alike) both experience compassion similar to the lifeboat dilemma example on Bein 128. The analogy is that both believe that only one faction can survive, and one of the factions must be within the lifeboat and the other must drown. In remaining on the battleﬁeld to observe and mourn the necessary deaths, Red exposes her compassion to the reader. It is on this battleﬁeld where Red ﬁrst encounters Blue, though the only contact they have is through a taunting, complimentary, and slightly ﬂirtatious letter that Blue leaves for Red to ﬁnd. In reading this letter, Red is cognizant of the fact that she will be \"infected\" by Blue, that she will be exposed to knowledge of Blue that will give rise to compassion and perhaps tip the scales against her side in the time wars. \"It is a trap, of course.\" Red observes before opening the letter. For her part, Blue acknowledges the interconnectedness of self from the outset. In her opening salvo to Red, she proclaims: I must tell you it gives me great pleasure to think of you reading these words in licks and whorls of ﬂame, your eyes unable to work backwards, unable to keep the letters on a page; instead you must absorb them, 2 3 3 33 1 1 Page 5 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 Page 5 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 3 admit them into your memory. In order to recall them you must seek my presence in your thoughts, tangled among them like sunlight in water. In order to report my words to your superiors you must admit yourself already inﬁltrated, another casualty of this most unfortunate day. This is how we'll win. What I could not appreciate about this when I read it the ﬁrst time was the devilish subtlety of that ﬁnal statement. At the time I assumed when Blue said \"we\" she was referring to Nature. In retrospect, I believe she was referring to the great-self (Bein 137). Bein discusses the many spiritual interpretations and manifestations of the great self, and their importance when trying to navigate the fourth condition of compassion as a viable source of moral guidance. The fourth condition is exceptionally difﬁcult to address from an eastern perspective, as aretaic, nihilist, and utilitarian philosophies (amongst others) are ﬁercely individualistic, which gives rise to insoluble or at least gordian dilemmas, many of which challenge the ﬁrst condition (because they require other values to intervene on compassion’s behalf). Another way to put this is that Western philosophy tends to be agent-based, while Eastern philosophy tends to be relationship-based, or interconnected. A fundamentally interconnected perspective, allows the 1st and 4th condition to be simultaneously satisﬁed. The remainder of the story is told through letters to and from these two protagonists, and in the moments around the reading or delivering of the letters. These letters are often digested by the opponents, and always consumed by a third party, \"the seeker.\" This ingestion of letters is a metaphor for fellow-feeling (Mitgefühl) (Bein 5), and for emotional infection (Bein 4). Additionally it sets the stage for an overarching theme throughout the novella of similar possibilities: “similar possibilities, which assess whether the C-feeler and the C-object (to use Snow’s terminology) are similarly situated in such a way that the C-feeler sees the suffering of the C-object and thinks, 'It could have been me.'” (qtd. in Bein 43). Later in the story, it is revealed that the eating of letters brings parts of the writer into the reader's self (literally and ﬁguratively). 2 3 Page 6 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 Page 6 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 4 In each of the subsequent letters there are questions asked and discoveries made about the other. In this exchange empathy is seeded and cultivated. Blue learns that Red's people eat, though they do not require it. Red learns that Blue's people do not make friends, though they are collectivists. How about you? I don’t mean, necessarily, how do you eat, though if you want to ﬁll me in, be my guest. (Your descriptions of honey and bread—thank you for that.) I’ve described, a bit, our overlapping models —communities public and private, shared interests, shared senses. What’s it like to be a part of yours? Do you have friends, Blue? And how? You asked me to tell truths. I have. What do I want? Understanding. Exchange Through this mutual discovery Red and Blue begin the process of merging their ﬁeld of selves (Bein 65). In describing their overlapping models, you can almost see the ﬁelds merging. Red is explicitly asking to bring Blue's world into perspective, to understand what is inexplicable to her. Bein grants the value of this kind of understanding and perspective shifting as (at least one) deﬁnition of compassion. To attempt to perceive the world from another person’s perspective and to refuse to separate the advancement of that person’s interests from the advancement of one’s own is not a bad deﬁnition of compassion (Bein 72). Beyond being a self-contained “deﬁnition of compassion,” this perspective shifting is a step towards fulﬁlling the irreducible relationality condition, as it pulls into relation two cultural bodies who historically were not able to really perceive the other except in the most abstract ways. As the story progresses, the great self takes center stage. The lines between these agents of Technology and Nature blur until they begin to disappear entirely. One interpretation of this story that appeals to me is that these agents are representative of the very best qualities of each of their factions, and that by merging their ﬁeld of selves, they are creating a harmony between nature and technology. In a letter from Blue to Red, we see a lesson and an entreaty to join themselves in a ﬁeld of selves. 1 32 Page 7 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 Page 7 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 5 I have been birds and branches. I have been bees and wolves. I have been ether ﬂooding the void between stars, tangling their breath into networks of song. I have been ﬁsh and plankton and humus, and all these have been me. But while I’ve been enmeshed in this wholeness—they are not the whole of me… but I look at you, Red, and see much of myself For her part, Red shares how she has integrated with Blue, \"When she is sure no one is watching, she rereads the letters she’s carved into herself.\" If this were merely a story of two individuals (it does share some common themes with Romeo and Juliet) this grand analogy to compassion might feel somewhat anemic. What makes it such a compelling playground for exploring the value of compassion is that these characters, with their strikingly generic names, expansive qualities, and indeed myriad embodiments of the great self itself are themselves facets of a fractured anatmān. In the culmination of this riveting tale, Red is forced by her leadership to create a poisoned letter to Blue. She tries to warn Blue (through a preemptive letter) not to read (consume) it, but is unsurprised when Blue knowingly ingests the poison. Red now becomes the seeker. Trailing themself through time and space, the seeker consumes scraps of Red and Blue, making themself whole in the ﬁeld of self. The seeker pauses at times to observe the prescience of their words to each other. \"How long had she planned this? How long did you know, my mood indigo?\" and as they recognize that they (and all that they represent) have always been one self, they also acknowledge the rupture as well as the repair that great self requires. She shades herself with Blue, from blood, tears, skin, ink, words. She thrashes with the pain of growth inside her: new organs bloom from autosynthesized stem cells to shoulder old bits of her away. Green vines twine her heart and seize it, and she vomits and sweats until the vines’ rhythm matches hers. A second skin grows within her skin, popping, blistering. She claws herself off upon the rocks like a snake and lies transformed. And more: A different mind plays around the edges of her own. 1 1 1 1 6 Page 8 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 Page 8 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 6 Thus embodied (Red within Blue within Red, etc.) The seeker is able to penetrate time and the immune system of Nature to ﬁnd Blue. Yet even upon arriving in nature's hallowed sanctuary, as the seeker treads Garden's bed, they wonder if they have truly achieved the compassion required to heal what was ruptured. When seeker wonders \"Is she Blue enough?\" they are questioning whether they have sufﬁciently understood and empathized with what it means to be Blue, to exist in her space without being rejected as other. Or put another way, are they (the seeker) anatmān or still Red's ego self (Bein 98 & 109). The triumph of This is How You Lose the Time War, is revealed in the ﬁnal pages. The seeker ﬁnds juvenile Blue—a princess waking as if from a dream—in Garden's bed. This manifestation of anatmān (seeker) kisses young Blue, cutting their lip on Blue's rows of razor sharp teeth, and bestowing the gift of no-self—of connection—onto the child. \"Take this of me, Red [as seeker] thinks. Carry it in yourself, a root fed by what would kill it. Carry hunger all your days. Let it guard you, guide you, save you.\" Blue then consciously accepts the gift, \"The gaze of the girl who would be Blue ﬁxes on her, soft with dreams, trusting. She tastes what she is offered, knows the pain in it, and swallows.\" In accepting what is offered, young Blue begins her compassionate journey. Always cognizant of her great-self, she enters the war seeking understanding of her enemy, not to defeat her, but to become one with her. Blue (and depending on how you hold time, Red as well) never intended to win the time war for her Shift (faction), she intended to end the time war (a victory for the great self). The ﬁnal lines of the story contain the cherry that adorns this metaphor of compassion. As Red (post seeker, but still Blue in Red in Blue, etc.) is thrown into her cell back at the Agency, she ﬁnds a ﬁnal letter from Blue. There’s still a war out there, of course. But this is a strategy untested. What would Genghis say if we built a bridge together, Red? Suppose we reached across the burn of threads and tangles, cut through the braid’s knots—suppose that we defected, not to each other’s sides, but to each other? [...] Shall we prick and twist and play the braid until it yields us a 5 8 1 1 4 Page 9 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 Page 9 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 7 place downthread, bend the fork of our Shifts into a double helix around our base pair? In this passage, Blue is overtly suggesting to (post-seeker) Red that they are one self, inexorably tied in past, present and future, and that the destruction that has been wrought to all of existence throughout time is perhaps due to the rupture that their Shifts created in the great self; a rupture that can be repaired through their merging. The story, and my essay, concludes with this glorious quote that I feel represents the nexus of compassion as I have been seeking to comprehend and internalize it throughout this semester: I don’t give a shit who wins this war, Garden or the Agency— towards whose Shift the arc of the universe bends. But maybe this is how we win, Red. You and me. This is how we win. An Ethic of Compassion provides a model in which the individual (concentric model of) self is not capable of winning or losing. The only win condition that is possible in an Ethic of Compassion is a we-state victory, in which we represents all of existence. Throughout this beautiful narrative the 8 conditions for compassion to be a viable source of moral guidance have been illustrated in non-philisophical (but equally valid) poetic terms: 1. It must be an ethically primary trait. The protagonists actions can, at all stages be driven by compassion alone (understanding that their ﬁeld of self expands from the individual to universal as the story progresses). 2. It must recognize the role of affect. Red & Blue are both compelled by both logical (cognitive) and emotional factors at each stage of their journey 3. It must be capable of generating personally directed imperatives. Compassion can be observed to generate personally directed imperatives throughout the story. “ She tastes what she is offered, knows the pain in it, and swallows.\" 4.It must recognize from its very roots the irreducible relationality of human existence. I have never before read a book which has so clearly demonstrated the irreducible relationality of all existence, in both time and space. “Shall we prick and twist and play 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 Page 10 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 Page 10 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 8 the braid until it yields us a place downthread, bend the fork of our Shifts into a double helix around our base pair?” 5. It must be as concerned with the promotion of satisfaction as it is concerned with the alleviation of suffering. The actions of the protagonists are increasingly concerned with both reducing suffering and promoting satisfaction. “to be honest, love confuses me. I’ve never felt it before this —I’ve had joy in sex; I’ve had fast friendships. Neither feels right for this, and this feels bigger than both.” 6. It must not degrade its object. Both Red and Blue (as well as their Shifts) are maintained as powerful, autonomous, and respected throughout the story 7. It must not be essentially comparative or competitive in nature. Though there is great competitiveness, it is not in pursuit of being more virtuous, and when a solution is presented where survival of one Shift at the expense of the other can potentially be side-stepped, that path is chosen by both Red and Blue. 8. It must not be so narrow in scope that. This story literally encompasses all of creation throughout time and space. All are considered morally worthy. Bein made his arguments well, and there is scant margin to improve on the rational merits presented in Compassion and Moral Guidance. What Mohtar, and Gladstone have done in This Is How You Lose the Time War is to bring these arguments into a poetic and deeply emotional context, so that readers may feel as well as know the value of compassion in moral guidance. In doing so, they have reinforced Bein’s second condition “It must recognize the role of affective as well as cognitive activity in moral decision making” and used that emotional impact to drive home the “irreducible relationality of all” matter in time and space (129). For this reason, I am proudly advancing compassion to the highest echelon of my personal value system. May it guide us well. 2 2 7 1 2 Page 11 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021 Page 11 of 11 - Integrity Submission Submission ID trn:oid:::1:3243771021","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
