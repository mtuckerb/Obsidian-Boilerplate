Waterman Trenton State College Those aspects of Erikson's theory of psychosocial development concerning the formation of a sense of personal identity are examined in light of research evi- dence. When the Stage 5 component is considered as a bipolar dimension, the expectation is that the transition from adolescence to adulthood involves a pro- gressive strengthening in the sense of identity. When the identity construct is expanded to include the processes by which an identity is formed, it is hypoth- esized that over time there will be progressive developmental shifts in identity status, that is, from the identity diffusion status into either the foreclosure or moratorium status, from the foreclosure into the moratorium status, and from the moratorium into the identity achievement status. The circumstances asso- ciated with progressive shifts, regressive changes, and reentry into an identity crisis are discussed. The review of the literature focuses on questions of the direction and timing of identity development, sex differences in development, and the identification of antecedent conditions relating to the choice of developmental pathways. Erikson's (1963, 1968) construct of iden- tity has become the principal tool for un- derstanding the development of personality from adolescence into adulthood: The wholeness to be achieved at this stage I have called a sense of inner identity. The young person, in order to experience wholeness, must feel a progressive continuity between that which he has come to be during the long years of childhood and that which he promises to become in the anticipated future; between that which he con- ceives himself to be and that which he perceives others to see in him and to expect of him. Individually speaking, identity includes, but is more than, the sum of all the successive identifications of those earlier years when the child wanted to be, and often was forced to become, like the people he depended on. Identity is a unique product, which now meets a crisis to be solved only in new iden- tifications with age mates and with leader figures outside of the family. (Erikson, 1968, p. 87) Erikson has identified several develop- mental issues that may become the focus of an identity crisis. There is the choice of an occupation that is both socially recognized and personally expressive. Another is the development of an ideological world view that is worthy of a personal commitment. Such an ideology may be either religious or political in nature. Other questions involve Requests for reprints should be sent to Alan S.

Here too the task is to find modes of expression that reflect intrinsic in- clinations and for which sufficient sources of social support exist within the individual's cultural milieu. Since the construct of identity was intro- duced for purposes of clinical analysis, whether of individuals or of cultures, its def- inition could remain richly associative with- out being precisely specified. The impact of Erikson's clinical interpretations rests, in part, on his capacity to persuade the reader that quite diverse forms of behavior are ac- countable for in terms of a limited number of concepts* However, the absence of a de- finitive statement of the boundaries of the identity construct has posed a problem for researchers attempting to develop opera- tional definitions that cover the range of as- pects attributed to it. The assessment in- struments that have been developed have usually focused on some combination of the following facets of identity: (a) a clear sense of self-definition; (b) the presence of com- mitments regarding goals, values, and be- liefs; (c) the existence of activity directed toward the implementation of commitments; (d) the consideration of a range of identity alternatives; (e) the extent of self-accep- 341 342 ALAN S. WATERMAN tance; (f) a sense of personal uniqueness; and (g) confidence in one's personal future. Among the global paper-and-pencil instru- ments with items tapping different combi- nations of these themes are Rasmussen's (1961) Ego Identity Scale, Dignan's (1965) Ego Identity Scale, the Ego Identity-Incom- plete Sentences Blank (Marcia, 1966), the Inventory of Psychosocial Development (Constantinople, 1969), and the Identity Achievement Scale (Simmons, 1970). Such a global approach to assessment per- mits a determination of the extent to which a person has established a clear sense of identity but does not provide information on the processes by which identity elements were developed. In writing on the processes of development, Erikson (1958) used Wil- liam James's distinction between those who are once born and those who go through a second birth or growth crisis in the shaping of their identity. The former experience no difficulties in fitting themselves into their society. They translate their childhood iden- tifications into adult experience without se- rious doubt or conflict. In contrast, the twice born undergo a crisis of purpose or faith in which their adult commitments are formed as an act of personal choice. Marcia (1966) constructed a semistruc- tured interview by which to assess both the clarity of personal identity and the process by which it develops. The classification sys- tem used is composed of four ego identity statuses: (a) identity achievement, (b) mor- atorium, (c) foreclosure, and (d) identity diffusion. These statuses are defined in terms of two dimensions: crisis and commitment. \"Crisis\" refers to a period of struggle or ac- tive questioning in arriving at such aspects of personal identity as vocational choice and ideological beliefs. \"Commitment\" involves making a firm, unwavering decision in such areas and engaging in appropriate imple- menting activities. An identity achiever is someone who has gone through a period of crisis and has de- veloped relatively firm commitments. The term moratorium is used to refer to a person who is currently in a state of crisis and is actively seeking among alternatives in an attempt to arrive at a choice. A person is classified as a foreclosure if he or she has never experienced a crisis but is nevertheless committed to particular goals, values, or beliefs. The commitments that foreclosures have made generally reflect the wishes of parents or other authority figures. The cat- egory of identity diffusion includes individ- uals who do not have firm commitments and who are not actively trying to form them. They may never have been in crisis, or they may have had a period of questioning and been unable to resolve it, subsequently emerging without having made a decision. There have been several recent reviews of the research literature on identity (Bourne, 1978a, 1978b; Marcia, 1980, Note 1) eval- uating the validity of the various assessment techniques and documenting the broad range of variables to which identity is related. The more limited focus here is on theory and re- search pertaining to questions of identity for- mation. Specifically, the issues to be dis- cussed are (a) the direction and timing of identity development, (b) sex differences in development, and (c) antecedent conditions relating to the choice of developmental path- ways. Developmental Hypotheses Direction and Timing of Development At its simplest, the basic hypothesis of identity development is that the transition from adolescence to adulthood involves a progressive strengthening in the sense of identity. It is this hypothesis that has been tested in numerous studies using paper-and- pencil measures of identity. Because Marcia's identity interview pro- cedure involves categorizing individuals ac- cording to their strategy for handling the task of identity formation and does not yield a single continuous measure, a more complex set of developmental patterns can be iden- tified. A schematic presentation of the path- ways of identity status formation consistent with Erikson's theory is given in Figure 1. A person who is in the identity diffusion status may (a) become a moratorium by beginning to seriously explore a variety of identity alternatives (D —» M); (b) become a foreclosure by latching on to the first real possibility that is presented without ever evaluating other courses of action (D —> F); IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT 343 or (c) continue indefinitely in the diffusion status, never making a serious effort to work out identity issues (D —» D). A person who is in the foreclosure status may (a) become a moratorium if the early commitments are challenged in a way that requires the consideration of alternative pos- sibilities (F —* M); (b) continue as a fore- closure, carrying into adulthood commit- ments to the goals and values that were developed prior to or during adolescence (F —» F); or (c) become a diffusion if the initial commitments gradually become less meaningful without steps being taken to re- vise or replace them (F —> D). A person who has entered the moratorium status may (a) become an identity achiever by establishing firm, meaningful commit- ments to specific goals and values (M —* A) or (b) become an identity diffusion by giving up on the efforts to find something worth- while to which to become committed (M^D). 1 A person who has become an identity achiever may (a) continue as an achiever, maintaining the commitments to the goals and values that were worked out during the identity crisis (A —»A); (b) again become a moratorium, reentering crisis if the earlier resolution proves unsatisfactory in some way (A —»M); or (c) become a diffusion if the commitments that were established gradu- ally lose their vitality without triggering a new crisis (A —> D). Of the changes in status just described, the following constitute progressive devel- opmental shifts: from the identity diffusion status into either the foreclosure or mora- torium status, from the foreclosure into the moratorium status, and from the morato- rium into the identity achievement status. Each represents movement involving either the initiation of reflective consideration of identity alternatives or the development of personally meaningful commitments, A change into the identity diffusion status from any of the other statuses can be viewed as developmentally regressive, since it involves a putting aside of identity concerns, at least temporarily, without having established a satisfactory resolution. The shift from the identity achievement to the moratorium sta- tus might more appropriately be considered M MM F Figure 1. A model of the sequential patterns of ego identity development. (D = identity diffusion; F = fore- closure; M = moratorium; A = identity achievement.) as the resumption of a crisis rather than a developmental regression. It reflects a con- tinuation of the identity formation process, an attempt to make more rewarding choices, not a renunciation of identity concerns. The above constitutes a descriptive model rather than a theory of development, since there are virtually no patterns of identity status change inconsistent with it. The utility of the model rests in the opportunity it af- fords to study the relative frequency of the different developmental paths and the cir- cumstances that influence their adoption. It thus becomes possible to compare the pat- terns of development among various groups within a population (and between popula- tions) and to identify the impact of socio- historical conditions on identity formation. The basic hypothesis of identity develop- ment may now be phrased: Movement from adolescence to adulthood involves a prepon- derance of changes in identity status which can be characterized as progressive devel- opmental shifts. There are two questions related to the direction of identity development about which little a priori theorizing has been done. One concerns the relative stability of the various identity statuses. It can be antici- ' Continuing in the moratorium status is not included here, since indefinitely maintaining an identity crisis is highly improbable (although theoretically possible). Moving from the moratorium (or achiever) status to the foreclosure status is not a theoretical possibility. Once a person has undergone an identity crisis, he or she no longer can meet the definition of a foreclosure, even if he or she goes back to the same goals and values that were held before the crisis. 344 ALAN S. WATERMAN pated that the moratorium category will be the least stable of the statuses, since it is associated with an expressed desire to make changes in one's life. Further it is difficult for individuals to sustain the subjective dis- comfort usually associated with identity crises. If a successful resolution cannot be achieved, the person is likely to eventually renounce the task as unresolvable. However, it is unclear as to which status will be the most stable. While both the foreclosure and identity achievement statuses involve com- mitments, the stability of either type of com- mitment may be influenced by a wide variety of life events. The lack of commitment char- acteristic of the identity diffusion status may or may not prove to be a relatively stable developmental quality. Further, it is possible that the relative stability of the various sta- tuses will vary by the topic area in which identity is considered. The other question best approached in empirical fashion concerns the timing of identity changes. In his discussion of the epigenetic principle, Erikson (1959) refers not only to a proper sequence of stage de- velopment but to a proper rate. Stage 5 in his theory can be presumed to cover much or all of the period from puberty through the college years. He does not, however, suggest a timetable of the ages at which particular identity issues are most likely to arise, be- come a focus of development, and reach eventual resolution. Although wide individ- ual differences in the timing of identity de- velopment may be expected, it should be of interest to determine if there are character- istic times (or developmental settings) as- sociated with the greatest probability of change. Sex Differences in Identity Development Since Erikson (1963, 1968, 1975) wrote extensively on the differences in psycholog- ical functioning between the sexes, it might be expected that he would anticipate sex differences in the patterns of identity for- mation. It is questionable, however, as to whether he intended such a hypothesis. Be- fore addressing that question, it is helpful to look at the differences that he does de- scribe. Working from his experience with the play constructions of preadolescent participants in a long-term development study, Erikson discussed differences between the sexes in the real and symbolic use of space. He drew an association between the play construc- tions and anatomically based genital modes. Males, with external genital organs, erect- able and intrusive, developed play construc- tion characterized by height and downfall, strong motion and its channelization or ar- rest. Females, with internal genital organs having vestibular access, constructed static interiors that were open, simply enclosed, and peaceful or intruded upon. However, Erikson did not conclude that intrusion and enclosing were the exclusive prerogatives of males and females, respectively. Rather, these differences were seen as ones of \"pre- disposition and prediction.\" He wrote that where cultural and historical conditions per- mit, each sex may be led \"to make use of, to share, and at times to imitate, the con- figurations most typical of the other sex\" (Erikson, 1975, p. 233). The emphasis Erikson (1975) placed on the presence of anatomically based sex dif- ferences in behavior reflects an effort to counter the assertions made by some that all sex differences are learned. He did not pos- tulate different developmental processes for males and females. Thus, while biological predispositions may be expected to play some role regarding the content of identity choices, they would not necessarily be in- volved in the processes by which identity elements are selected. Both sexes may undergo comparable experiences of crisis and commitment. It should be recognized that any sex differences observed in the fre- quency of presence in the different identity statuses can be interpreted as a function of cultural influences, not a result of the un- folding of different developmental capabili- ties. Antecedent Conditions Relating to Identity Development The choice of a developmental pathway for identity formation may be expected to be influenced by a variety of interrelated variables. The following is a summary pre- IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT 345 sentation of hypotheses relating antecedent conditions to the course of identity devel- opment. 1. The greater the extent of identification with parents prior to or during adolescence, the greater the likelihood will be of forming and maintaining personally meaningful commitments. With strong identification, entrance into, and maintenance of, the fore- closure status appears most probable. 2. Differences in parenting styles (Becker, 1964) will be reflected in differences in path- ways of identity formation. Individuals with permissive, neglecting, or rejecting parents may be expected most frequently to be iden- tity diffuse and to have difficulty in success- fully resolving identity crises should they occur. Those from authoritarian families may take either of two quite divergent paths, becoming foreclosed on parental choices or rebelling and going through an identity cri- sis, perhaps of quite strenuous proportions. The former alternative should be more com- mon under circumstances where an adoles- cent is able to earn parental respect, whereas the latter should more frequently occur where parental approval cannot be gained. Both protective and indulgent parenting styles may be expected to yield outcomes characterized either by relative insecurity (identity diffusion) or by docile conformity (foreclosure). Finally, democratic parenting should be relatively conducive to the consid- eration of identity alternatives and the form- ing of personal commitments (identity achievement). Presence in the foreclosure status may also be expected where any early decisions are functional for the adolescent and meet with parental support. 3. The greater,the range of identity al- ternatives to which an individual is exposed prior to or during adolescence, the greater the likelihood will be of undergoing an iden- tity crisis. Thus, homogeneous communities may be conducive to the forming and main- taining of foreclosure commitments, whereas more heterogeneous communities may serve to facilitate the entrance into an identity crisis. 4. The greater the availability of model figures perceived as living successfully, the greater the probability will be that a person will form meaningful commitments. This should have particular relevance for the like- lihood of successfully resolving an identity crisis, since successful adult models may serve as examples of how to cope with dif- ficulties and may suggest identity content alternatives that can be profitably explored. Similarly, the parents' own identity statuses may influence the process of identity devel- opment through the model value they have for the adolescent. 5. The nature of the social expectations pertaining to identity choices arising within the family, the schools, and the peer group will contribute to the particular identity de- velopment pathways employed. Where one is exposed to social groups that seldom ques- tion received authority, an identity crisis would appear less probable than among groups where questioning is more common and even encouraged. 6. Consistent with the epigenetic princi- ple, it is anticipated that to the extent that preadolescent personality provides an appro- priate foundation for coping with identity concerns (i.e., there are sufficient levels of basic trust, autonomy, initiative, and indus- try), the more successfully identity devel- opment is likely to proceed. Similarly, suc- cess in such other aspects of development as formal operations and moral reasoning may also contribute to advances in identity for- mation. Research Evidence Direction and Timing of Development Development prior to and during the high school years. Prior to the high school years, there appears to be little interest in identity- related questions. Ciaccio (1971) used a Thematic Apperception Test-type story-tell- ing projective instrument to assess the extent of concerns associated with each of the first five stages described by Erikson. The sam- ples consisted of males at three age levels: 5, 8, and 11 years. The results of a \"unit utterance\" scoring procedure indicated that the 11-year-old boys were beginning to ev- idence identity concerns, but the frequency of such concerns was far lower than for con- cerns associated with the earlier stage com- ponents of industry and initiative. Similarly, 346 ALAN S. WATERMAN in two studies using the ego identity inter- view with 11- to 13-year-olds (Meilman, 1979; Archer, Note 2), the identity achieve- ment status was observed in less than 4% of the topic area scoring decisions. The results of cross-sectional studies of development during the high school years using paper-and-pencil instruments have re- vealed only limited differences. Pomerantz (1979) found twelfth-grade females to score significantly higher than eighth-grade fe- males on the Rasmussen Ego Identity Scale, but the difference for males, though in the expected direction, was not significant. La Voie (1976) studied high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors of both sexes using Mar- cia's Ego Identity-Incomplete Sentences Blank and found a nonsignificant increase with increasing grade level. Similarly, How- ard (1960), in a comparison of sophomore and senior high school girls, found a nonsig- nificant increase in scores on her own iden- tity questionnaire. Cross-sectional studies involving the ego identity interview were conducted by Meil- man (1979) and Archer (Note 2). The par- ticipants in Meilman's study were college- bound males aged 12, 15, and 18 years. 2 Those in Archer's study were males and fe- males from Grades 6, 8, 10, and 12, without restriction as to future plans. In both studies, at the youngest age level virtually all par- ticipants were in the foreclosure and/or identity diffusion statuses. The foreclosure status was more frequent in the areas of sex role attitudes (included only in Archer's study), avocational choice (included only in Meilman's study), and religious beliefs (in- cluded in both studies), and the identity dif- fusion status was most frequent in the area of political ideology (included in both stud- ies). In comparison, the oldest high school samples evidenced more instances of the identity achievement status in both studies, and these increases with age were distributed across all content areas. There were corre- sponding decreases in instances of the iden- tity diffusion status, also distributed across the various content areas. The frequencies of the moratorium and foreclosure statuses did not change substantially during the pe- riod considered here. Hauser (1971) conducted a longitudinal study with a small sample of white and black male high school students from lower socio- economic status backgrounds. He used a combination of interview and Q-sort proce- dures over a 3-year period. He found the white adolescents to show a pattern of \"pro- gressive identity formation\" characterized by frequent changes in self-concept during the early high school years followed by in- creasing consistency and stability as the per- son approached high school graduation. In contrast, the black adolescents showed a general stability in their identity elements over the entire study period, a pattern Hau- ser termed \"identity foreclosure.\" He inter- preted this lack of change as reflecting a problem in development in that important developmental issues had been dodged rather than resolved. Many of the stable identity elements were defined in the negative; that is, the adolescent knew what he did not want to become rather than what alternative he actively wanted to pursue. The result was a rigid and impoverished self-definition. 3 Hau- ser speculated that these racial differences may have resulted from greater discrimi- nation directed toward poor blacks than to- ward whites from the same background. Development during the college years. It is during the college years that the greatest gains in identity formation appear to occur. College environments provide a diversity of experiences that can serve both to trigger consideration of identity issues and to sug- gest alternative resolutions for identity con- cerns. The results of numerous studies con- firm that, in general, senior men and women have a stronger sense of personal identity than do their freshman counterparts and that the identity commitments held as se- niors are more likely to have been arrived at through the successful resolution of iden- tity crises. Cross-sectional studies using paper-and- pencil measures of identity yield a consistent pattern of findings, with high scores asso- ciated with advancing age and/or years in 2 Meilman (1979) also included samples of males aged 21 and 24 years. 3 In Marcia's (1966) classification system, such in- dividuals would probably have been termed identity diffuse. IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT 347 college. Such results have been found for the Dignan Ego Identity Scale (Dignan, 1965; Stark & Traxler, 1974; Thompson, 1963) and the Stage 5 scale of the Inventory of Psychosocial Development (Constantinople, 1969; Whitbourne, Jelsma, & Waterman, 1982), though the effects were not always statistically significant. 4 Longitudinal stud- ies using the Inventory of Psychosocial De- velopment provide further evidence of iden- tity development during the college years (Constantinople, 1969, 1970; Whitbourne et al., 1982). Fry (1974) found significant gains on the Stage 5 components for a sample of college students from rural backgrounds but a retrogressive shift for those from urban backgrounds. There have been three longitudinal studies tracing identity development among college students using the ego identity interview pro- cedure. Adams and Fitch (in press) inter- viewed males and females from different col- lege cohorts at a state university in successive years. In the other studies, changes from the freshman to the senior year were assessed among male students at a technological in- stitute (Waterman & Waterman, 1971; Waterman, Geary, & Waterman, 1974) and at a private liberal arts college (Waterman & Goldman, 1976). In each of the studies, the interview covered the areas of vocational choice, religious beliefs, and political ideol- ogy. The results from the three schools were quite similar. 1. College clearly facilitates identity de- velopment in the area of vocational plans. In both studies covering the 4-year period from the freshman to the senior year, there were significant increases in the frequency of students in the identity achievement sta- tus and decreases in the frequency of stu- dents in the moratorium status. In addition, there was a decrease in the frequency of stu- dents in the identity diffusion status at the liberal arts college. In the 1-year study, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of identity diffusions and a nonsignificant increase in the frequency of identity achievers. 2. College experiences appear to under- mine traditional religious beliefs without necessarily helping the students to establish alternate belief systems. At all three colleges there were significant decreases in the fre- quency of students in the foreclosure status. At the state university there was an increase in the frequency of students in the identity achievement status, and at the technological school there was an increase in the frequency of identity diffusions. 3. Although the development of new, clearer commitments in the area of political ideology was observed to occur during the college years, a substantial proportion of the students demonstrated little interest in the topic. Significant increases in the frequency of the identity achievement status were ob- served over 1 year at the state university and over 4 years at the technological institute. At the state university there was also a sig- nificant increase in the frequency of the moratorium status. Significant decreases were found for the identity diffusion status at the state university and the foreclosure status at the technological institute. No sys- tematic changes were found for the students at the private liberal arts colleges. In both 4-year studies, more than half of the partic- ipants were approaching graduation without clear beliefs in this area and without trying to form any commitments. The patterns of identity development ob- served were relatively consistent across the three studies, but some differences were ev- ident. The differences may have been due to the distinctive characteristics of the student populations at the three schools. Differences in the timing of the studies may also have affected the results, particularly in the area of political ideology. For example, the first 4-year study was conducted at the techno- logical institute from 1968 to 1972 during the height of the antiwar protest. The second study, conducted at the private liberal arts college, took place from 1970 to 1975, with the senior-year interviews conducted after the issue of the war had largely subsided and following the Watergate scandal. It should also be noted that in all three studies, fcillow- up data were only obtained from individuals 4Protinsky (1975) found a similar difference in a comparison of junior high school students and college students for the Stage S items of the Rasmussen Ego Identity Scale. However, the broad age range of the participants in the study does not permit a determination as to the timing of development. 348 ALAN S. WATERMAN who continued at their respective schools throughout the period of the research. As yet, nothing is known about the patterns of development of those who withdraw from college. Development during the adult years. To date only limited research has been con- ducted concerning identity among adults. Waterman and Waterman (1975) compared the distribution of the identity status of col- lege males and their fathers. They found that the fathers (men between the ages of 40 and 65 years) were more frequently in the fore- closure status in the three topic areas cov- ered in the interview (vocational choice, re- ligious beliefs, and political ideology). Their sons were more likely to be in the morato- rium and identity diffusion statuses. A very high percentage of foreclosures was also found in a sample of married adult women between the ages of 23 and 50 years (Water- man, Note 3). All of the women were from middle-class communities, were in their ini- tial marriage, and had at least one child aged 17 years or less living at home. The greatest concentrations of foreclosure decisions were in the topic areas of family/career priorities, religious beliefs, and sex role attitudes. It seems reasonable to suggest that the high percentage of foreclosures among these adult men and women were a function of the so- cietal conditions that were present when they were in the stages of adolescence and youth (e.g., the depression, World War II, or the Korean War). These studies may tell us more about the impact of sociohistorical events than about ontogenetic development. O'Connell (1976) conducted a retrospec- tive study of identity synthesis in married women with school-aged children. The women were classified as traditional (full- time homemakers), neotraditional (having resumed a career after an interruption for child bearing), or nontraditional (continu- ously committed to their careers). On the Sense of Identity Inventory, women in all samples indicated they had experienced an increasingly strong sense of identity as they moved from adolescence through the periods when they were first married, had their first child, and their children were of preschool age, to the point where their children were of school age. O'Connell observed that after marriage \"traditional and neotraditional women's sense of identity seems to undergo a moratorium [i.e., a hiatus] which is not terminated until the school children stage of the life cycle, while nontraditional women develop their sense of identity in a more straightforward progression\" (p. 683). Two longitudinal studies have traced iden- tity development from the college years into adulthood. Whitbourne and Waterman (1979), using the Inventory of Psychosocial Development, conducted a follow-up with male and female college alumni 10 years after they had completed the instrument as undergraduates. A significant increase was found for the Stage 5 scale assessing identity versus identity diffusion. Marcia (1976), us- ing the ego identity interview, followed up on 30 men who had originally been inter- viewed 6 years earlier while in college. All were living within a 50-mile radius of the city in which their college was located. The results were reported in terms of changes in overall identity status, a judgment arrived at by combining information from the vo- cational, religious, and political content areas of the interview. The identity statuses, aside from the moratorium status, were fairly sta- ble (70%). The individuals in the foreclosure and identity diffusion statuses were found to be more stable than were those in the iden- tity achievement status. Six of the 7 identity achievers at the time of the first interview were committed, as well, in the follow-up. However, 3 of the men were classified as foreclosures. These must be considered as anomolous changes, since once a person goes through an identity crisis, he or she can no longer fit the technical definition of the fore- closure status.5 Five of the 7 moratoriums in college had firm commitments at the fol- low-up, and 2 had become diffuse. Only 1 of the 16 participants who were foreclosed or diffuse at the beginning of the study had become an identity achiever, while 2 others were going through an identity crisis 6 years later. Thus it appears that the adult years 5 Waterman et al. (1974) analyzed instances of an- omolous scoring and found them due to (a) respondents' failing to report some significant piece of information in one interview that was reported in another interview and (b) inconsistent application of the scoring standards. IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT 349 are a period of strengthening of identity but not a time when many new identity issues are raised or novel possibilities considered. 6 Comparative Stability of the Identity Statuses The three longitudinal studies of identity development during the college years have also provided data on the relative stability of the identity statuses. Comparisons of rel- ative stability can be made for a 1-year pe- riod at the state university (Adams & Fitch, in press) and for a 4-year period at the tech- nological institute (Waterman & Water- man, 1971; Waterman et al, 1974) and the private liberal arts college (Waterman & Goldman, 1976). Table 1 contains the per- centage of instances in which an individual was in the same identity status at both the beginning and end of the study period in a particular content area of the interview. 7 As expected, the moratorium status was the least stable of the four statuses across the period from the freshman to the senior year and was the second least stable status in the shorter study. In the two 4-year stud- ies, there were 34 instances of identity crises in particular interview areas found at the start of the freshman year. Not one of these crises was continuing during the senior year. Of these crises over three quarters ended in the formation of clearly defined, personally meaningful commitments. At the technolog- ical institute 76% of the moratoriums had become identity achievers, and the corre- sponding figure at the private liberal arts college was 85%. Considering only those in- stances in the 1-year study in which the per- son had emerged from the moratorium sta- tus, in 85% of cases firm commitments had been developed. Thus, there is a very high probability that identity crises experienced in college will be successfully resolved. The stability of the other identity statuses was generally comparable. It was evident that in instances where individuals had firm commitments at the start of the study, ap- proximately one third to one half were no longer in the same identity status by the time of the follow-up. This finding for the identity achievement status makes it clear that the successful resolution of an identity crisis does not give a permanence to the commit- ment formed. Although the achievement sta- tus is slightly more stable than the foreclo- sure status, both statuses are affected by factors leading to the initiation of a crisis or to regression. When the comparative stability data are analyzed separately for the different content areas of the interview, some differences emerged. The identity achievement and fore- closure statuses were more stable in the area of vocational plans than in the other topic areas. Conversely, the identity diffusion sta- tus was more stable in the areas of religious beliefs and political ideology than in the area of vocational plans. The moratorium status was highly unstable in all interview areas. Sex Differences in Identity Development The paper-and-pencil measures of the identity construct indicate few differences between males and females. Sex differences have not been found on the identity items of the Inventory of Psychosocial Develop- ment (Constantinople, 1969; Waterman & Whitbourne, 1981; Whitbourne & Water- man, 1979); the Identity Achievement Sta- tus Scale (Simmons, 1970); the Texas Psy- chosocial Identity Scale (Dunivant & Bieri, Note 4); the Objective Measure of Ego Iden- tity Status (Adams, Shea, & Fitch, 1979); Rasmussen's Ego Identity Scale (Pomer- antz, 1979); or Marcia's Ego Identity-In- 6 The limited number of instances in which the adult men (Waterman & Waterman, 1975) and adult women (Waterman, Note 3) were found to be in the identity achievement status for the most part did involve crises occurring during the adult years. Because these fre- quencies were small, however, the findings can be viewed as consistent with the conclusion that the adult years do not constitute a period of extensive redirection of identity choices. In this regard, the phenomenon of midlife crisis should be studied from an identity status perspective. If such crises are or become frequent within the society, and if such crises entail the reflective con- sideration of identity alternatives, the above stated con- clusion will have to be modified. 7 The relative stability percentages reported here are underestimates of the actual extent of change, since in- dividuals who went through several changes during the study period and who resumed the same status they were in initially would be counted as stable. The content of the identity elements at the second interview may have been the same or different from their initial ideas. 350 ALAN S.

Dunivant and Bieri (Note 4) did find females to score higher than males on Gruen's (1960) Ego Identity Scale and Block's (1961) Role Consistency Index. At least 10 studies have been conducted that can be used for comparisons of the dis- tribution of the various identity statuses be- tween males and females. Two involved sam- ples of high school upperclassmen or recent high school graduates (Waterman & Archer, 1979; Grotevant, Note 5); six involved col- lege samples (Adams & Fitch, in press; Hodgson & Fisher, 1979; Orlofsky, 1978; Poppen, 1974; Waterman & Nevid, 1977; Rothman, Note 6); one involved a sample of 17- to 18-year-old Danish students (Matteson, 1977); and one involved adults (Tesch, 1980). Some differences emerged in particular content areas. Vocational choice. No sex differences were observed in either high school sample or in five of the six college samples. In one college sample, males were more frequently in the identity achievement status, and fe- males were more frequently foreclosed or diffuse (Hodgson & Fisher, 1979). Also, the Danish males showed more exploration of occupational alternatives than did the fe- males (Matteson, 1977). No difference was found for the adult sample. Religious beliefs. Among the high school students, Waterman and Archer (1979) found that males were disproportionately present in the foreclosure category and fe- males were overrepresented in the identity diffusion status. Grotevant (Note 5) found no difference in this area. At the college level, two studies indicated tendencies for males to more likely be identity achievers (Adams & Fitch, in press; Hodgson & Fisher, 1979); one showed a significant ef- fect for females to be more frequently in the achiever status (Orlofsky, 1978); and three revealed no differences (Poppen, 1974; Waterman & Nevid, 1977; Rothman, Note 6). The adult sample did not yield a signif- icant difference. Political ideology. Prior to the college years, Grotevant (Note 5) found males to be more frequently in the identity achieve- ment status and females more often in the moratorium status. In contrast, Waterman and Archer (1979) found males to be over- represented in the foreclosure category and females to be more frequently diffuse. Sig- nificant differences were also observed in two of the college studies, with males more often in the identity achievement status and fe- males overrepresented in the foreclosure sta- tus (Adams & Fitch, in press; Hodgson & Fisher, 1979). No differences were found in the other four college studies, nor were any found in the study of adults. Attitudes toward premarital intercourse. In three of the five college studies that in- cluded this topic area, females were found to be more frequently reported as identity achievers than were males, whereas the males were more frequently foreclosed or diffuse (Orlofsky, 1978; Poppen, 1974; Waterman & Nevid, 1977). Rothman (Note 6) found the identity achievement status to be the most frequent for both males and fe- males, with males more likely to be in the moratorium status and females more likely to be foreclosed. No differences were found by Hodgson and Fisher (1979). Matteson IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT 351 (1977) reported that among Danish stu- dents, females were more likely than males to undergo exploration of sexual identity alternatives. Sex role attitudes. At the high school level, no sex differences were observed in either study. Only one of the college studies included the topic of sex roles, and as in the area of sexual attitudes, females were more likely to be in the identity achievement and moratorium statuses, whereas the males were more likely to be foreclosed or diffuse (Hodgson & Fisher, 1979). Tesch (1980) found a trend toward a sex difference in this area for adults, with females somewhat more likely to be in the moratorium status and males overrepresented in the foreclosure cat- egory. Psychological significance of the identity statuses for males and females. The results of these analyses for sex differences suggest that in most interview topic areas, males and females undergo similar patterns of identity development. Only in the area of attitudes toward sexual behavior was there general, though not complete, consistency among the studies, indicating the use of different pro- cesses. (Not enough research on sex role attitudes has been conducted to reach a con- clusion regarding this topic.) It is clear that males and females are more similar than different in their use of developmental pro- cesses, but there is reason to believe that the identity statuses may nevertheless have dif- ferent psychological implications for the sexes (Marcia, 1980). For both sexes, the identity achievement status is associated with relatively good adaptive capacities, whereas the identity diffusion status is often associated with difficulties in coping. For the moratorium and foreclosure statuses, how- ever, sex differences emerge. Among males, individuals in the moratorium status look generally similar in behavioral traits to iden- tity achievers, and both stand in contrast with males in the foreclosure and identity diffusion statuses. Among females the pat- terns are more complex, with women in the foreclosure and identity achievement sta- tuses looking most similar on some qualities, while on others it is the identity achievement and moratorium women who appear most similar. Marcia (1980) suggests that \"the relative adaptiveness of the Moratorium and Foreclosure status for women is a function both of the dependent variables used in a particular study and of the existing cultural supports for women's explorations of alter- natives\" (p. 175). Antecedent Conditions Relating to Identity Development A large number of hypotheses were of- fered regarding variables that may contrib- ute to determining the course of identity development, but only a few have been in- vestigated. The search for antecedent influ- ences has focused on family variables, de- velopmental characteristics believed to be hierarchically related to identity, and per- sonal activities and interests. Family variables. Considerable atten- tion has been directed toward identifying the nature of differences in family relationships and parenting styles characteristic of indi- viduals in the various identity statuses. Since Marcia (1980) has reviewed this literature in some detail, only a brief summary of the findings will be presented here. As would be expected, foreclosures have been found to have the closest relationships with their parents. Both sons and daughters evaluate their parents most favorably and describe their families as child centered. The fathers of foreclosures are seen as relatively possessive and intrusive toward their sons while being more supportive and encourag- ing of their daughters. In turn, foreclosure sons are the most willing to involve their families in making important life decisions. In contrast, identity diffusions of both sexes reported the most distance from their fam- ilies. The parents of identity diffusions were seen as indifferent, inactive, detached, not understanding, and rejecting. Both males and females in the moratorium and identity achievement statuses were relatively critical of their parents and were likely to report themselves to be in conflict with their fam- ilies. Sons in these statuses were not likely to turn to their families when making im- portant life decisions. This tension within the family appears related to ambivalence on the part of both parents and offspring over the latter's attempts at individuation. With the 352 ALAN S. WATERMAN successful resolution of an identity crisis, better family relationships may be estab- lished. Finally, there is evidence that, in gen- eral, the nature of the relationship with the parent of the same sex is more strongly re- lated to identity status than is the relation- ship with the opposite-sex parent. It is an attractive hypothesis that parental behavior contributes to identity formation, and the pattern of research results obtained provides readily interpretable links between family functioning and the various identity statuses. However, for both methodological and conceptual reasons, it cannot be con- cluded that the family variables studied ac- tually do influence the process of identity development. In most studies, the research- ers have relied solely on verbal report mea- sures obtained from adolescent or youth re- spondents. These measures are subject to errors of memory, defensive distortion, and conscious impression management. The same problems exist in those studies where infor- mation was obtained from the parents. Even if the accuracy of the reports were assumed, it would still not be possible to reach a con- clusion concerning any causal contribution of family variables. The type of behavior shown by a son or daughter may well have elicited particular responses from the par- ents, which could account for the observed relationships. It is far easier to provide a sup- portive, child-centered environment when children identify strongly with the parents and follow family traditions without ques- tioning. In contrast, the ambivalence and conflict found in the family backgrounds,of moratoriums and identity achievers may be a response to the sometimes extreme shifts in behavior engaged in by a son or daughter going through a stressful, and stressing, identity search. Similarly, it is possible that the lack of involvement shown by the parents of identity diffusions may be at least par- tially the result of a child's giving few strongly directed behavioral stimuli to which the parents can respond. It is probably not possible to entirely unravel the complex causal effects present in any relationship of long duration. Long-term, longitudinal, pre- dictive studies appear necessary if any mean- ingful evaluation is to be made of the like- lihood that parenting behaviors contribute to the process by which identity is formed. Along another line, Waterman and Waterman (1975) hypothesized that parents may serve as role models for the type of de- cision-making processes involved in identity formation. However, they found no relation- ship between the identity statuses shown by a sample of fathers and their college-attend- ing sons. Variables relating to family stability have also been investigated as possible contribu- tors to identity development with conflicting results to date. Oshman and Manosevitz (1976) found that a sample of college males who experienced father absence from an av- erage age of about 10 years had significantly lower full scale scores on the Rasmussen Ego Identity Scale than did samples from intact families and families in which the mothers had remarried. The directions of differences were the same on all Ego Identity Scale stage scales, but the effect for the Stage 5 (identity vs. identity diffusion) items was not signifi- cant. Jordan (1970) found that college males in the identity diffusion status were more likely to have come from broken homes than were those in the other statuses. In contrast, St. Clair and Day (1979) reported that in a sample of high school females, two thirds of the students in the identity achiever status came from homes disrupted by divorce or the death of one parent, whereas less than one fifth of the students in each of the other statuses were from broken homes. Also, Grossman, Shea, and Adams (1980) found that male college students with a history of parental divorce scored higher on Marcia's Ego Identity-Incomplete Sentences Blank than did males from intact families or fe- males from either divorced or intact families. Developmental characteristics. One test of the epigenetic principle—that the suc- cessful resolution of the crisis associated with each of the earlier stages of psychoso- cial development provides the foundation for the successful development of identity—is furnished by the pattern of intercorrelations among the stage scales of the Inventory of Psychosocial Development (Constantinople, 1969). This instrument is designed to assess the personality components associated with IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT 353 each of the first six stages in Erikson's the- ory. As expected, the scores on the Stage 5 scale for identity versus identity diffusion have been shown to yield significant corre- lations with each of the earlier stage scales in samples of undergraduates drawn from five colleges and a sample of adult college alumni (La Voie & Adams, in press; Water- man, Buebel, & Waterman, 1970; Water- man & Whitbourne, 1981). Marcia and Miller (Note 7), working with a sample of adult women, compared the identity sta- tuses, as assessed by the ego identity inter- view, with regard to scores from the Inven- tory of Psychosocial Development. Women in the identity achievement status had the highest scores on each of the early stage scales, whereas those in the identity diffusion status consistently had the lowest scores. Rothman (1978) conducted a similar study with a college student sample using the Ras- mussen Ego Identity Scale instead of the Inventory of Psychosocial Development. Again the identity diffusion status was as- sociated with the lowest scores on each of the early stage scales, but no clear pattern existed among the other statuses. The stage components of autonomy and industry most clearly discriminated among the statuses. Ego identity has also been presumed to rest upon a developmental foundation pro- vided by other aspects of ego functioning than those focused on by Erikson. Efforts have been made to relate progress in identity formation to Loevinger's ego stages, Kohl- berg's stages of moral reasoning, and Pia- get's stages of cognitive functioning. In each instance there is a possibility that a certain level of stage functioning may constitute a necessary but not sufficient condition for adopting a particular path of identity for- mation. A positive relationship between identity and Loevinger's ego stages was obtained by Adams and Shea (1979) in a sample of male and female college students. They reported that while 20% of individuals in the identity diffusion status were in the A stage of self- protective functioning (the lowest stage ob- served in the sample), less than 4% of those in each of the other statuses were at that level. In contrast, only 5% of identity dif- fusions were at or above the 1-4 stage of conscientious functioning; the corresponding percentages for the other status were 19% for foreclosures, 29% for moratoriums, and 37% for identity achievers. The only two in- dividuals at the 1-6 stage of integrated func- tioning were in the identity achievement sta- tus. These data suggest that the attainment of Stage 1-4 could constitute a necessary but not sufficient condition for movement out of the identity diffusion status. (The few ex- ceptions found in the study may have been a function of measurement error on either variable.) The possibility also exists that Stage 1-6 is a necessary condition for be- coming an identity achiever, but the ex- tremely small sample involved renders such a relationship highly speculative. Adams and Fitch (1981) conducted a 1- year follow-up with the sample from the pre- vious study. They found considerable change in both identity status and ego stage. Cross- lagged correlations using continuous mea- sures on both variables yielded evidence of contemporaneous change but not sequen- tially. (It should be noted that the contin- uous measure of identity did not preserve the uniqueness of the different identity statuses.) A positive relationship between identity status and level of moral reasoning was ob- tained in three studies of college samples using Kohlberg's interview procedure or a modification of it (Podd, 1972; Poppen, 1974; Rowe & Marcia, 1980). The identity achievement status was most strongly asso- ciated with postconventional moral reason- ing, whereas the foreclosure and identity diffusion statuses were overrepresented at the preconventional and conventional levels. Cauble (1976) did not find a difference be- tween the combined identity achievement and moratorium statuses and the combined foreclosure and identity diffusion statuses using Rest's Defining Issues Test as the mea- sure of moral reasoning. The study by Podd provided data in a form most suitable for determining whether the postconventional level of reasoning serves as a necessary but not sufficient condition for entering the mor- atorium and/or identity achievement sta- tuses. He found 51% of the participants in the identity achievement status to be func- 354 ALAN S. WATERMAN tioning at the postconventional level. The corresponding percentages for the other sta- tuses were 31% for moratorium, 12% for foreclosure, and 9% for identity diffusion. Thus, although a relationship between the two developmental schemes is apparent, postconventional reasoning does not serve as a necessary condition for entering or suc- cessfully resolving an identity crisis. It has also been hypothesized that formal operational thought is related to the likeli- hood of undergoing and resolving an identity crisis (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958; Kohlberg & Gilligan, 1971). However, the research results obtained to date have been largely negative. Neither Berzonsky, Weiner, and Raphael (1975) nor Cauble (1976) have ob- tained support for the hypothesis. Rowe and Marcia (1980) obtained supportive results, but their sample size was too small for mean- ingful statistical analysis. Marcia (1980) suggested that methodological problems in the earlier research may account for the neg- ative results. Since virtually all of the research on de- velopmental characteristics has involved as- sessment at only a single point in time, it is not possible to conclude that these variables actually constitute antecedents of progress in identity formation. The associations ob- served could be operating in either direction, or the change may be occurring simulta- neously rather than sequentially. Again, lon- gitudinal research is needed to establish whether any of the stage constructs are pre- dictive antecedents of identity development. Interests and activities. A large number of correlates of the identity statuses have been identified, any of which might contrib- ute to the process of identity development; however, in only a couple of instances is there reason to believe that a sequential ar- rangement may exist. In the longitudinal studies conducted at the technological insti- tute and the private liberal arts college (Waterman & Waterman, 1971; Waterman et al, 1974; Waterman & Goldman, 1976), the College Student Questionnaire-Part 1 (Peterson, 1965) was given to all partici- pants at the beginning of their freshman year. The Cultural Sophistication scale, which taps an interest in such areas as art, music, literature, and foreign films, was found to be predictive of identity formation. At both schools, freshmen who were identity achievers scored higher on the scale than did freshmen who were not identity achievers. More importantly, students who became identity achievers during their college years had more cultural interests as freshmen than did students who did not enter the status. Cultural interests may contribute either to the creation of identity crises and/or their resolution. The exposure to new ideas through cultural media may serve to challenge the views with which a person was raised and suggest more promising identity alternatives to which commitments can be formed. A possibly related variable shown to be associated with identity development is ex- pressive writing activity. Among samples of both high school and college students, males and females who wrote poetry were far more likely to be in the identity achievement status than were students who had never written poetry (Waterman & Archer, 1979; Water- man, Kohutis, & Pulone, 1977). No differ- ences were found between students who had kept a personal journal or diary and those who had not. Since expressive writing was found to have started relatively early in ad- olescence, the poetry writing activities were almost certainly antecedent to the achieving of a stable sense of identity. It had been originally expected that poetry writing and journal keeping would yield sim- ilar results. The differences may be ex- plained in terms of the ways in which the students approached the two types of expres- sion. Both groups saw their writings as help- ing to increase their level of self-understand- ing, but there were differences in the themes written about and in the perceptions of the functions the writing served (Waterman & Archer, 1979). Journal keeping appeared to be used primarily for making a record of current activities and for describing rela- tionships with friends and parents. In con- trast, poetry writing was seen as a vehicle for the creative expression of more abstract, emotional concerns. Further, poetry writers were much more likely to want to share their writings than were journal keepers. Thus, poetry writing may be a technique that is IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT 355 instrumental in working through an identity crisis by aiding in the exploration of possible identity alternatives and by serving as a means for gaining feedback from others. Rather than there being a direct, facili- tative connection between cultural interests, poetry writing, and identity formation, it is possible that all three may relate to some common underlying psychological quality involving curiosity and exploration. The im- petus to explore the realm of ideas and feel- ings through cultural media and personal emotional states through poetry writing may also be involved in the tendency to consider a variety of identity alternatives. One other variable that may serve as an antecedent of identity formation is the in- dividual's work history. Munro and Adams (1977) reported a comparison of the distri- bution of the identity statuses between sam- ples of college students and working youth of equivalent age. They found the working sample to be more frequently in the identity achievement status and the college sample to be more often in the identity diffusion status. The groups differed significantly with respect to identity status in the areas of re- ligious beliefs and political ideology but not with respect to vocational choice. Munro and Adams (1977) suggested that full-time em- ployment \"might stimulate rapid movement toward identity formation, while college at- tendance might be seen as an extended mor- atorium period\" (p. 523). Concluding Comments The basic hypothesis embodied in Erik- son's theory of identity development—that movement from adolescence to adulthood involves changes in identity that can be characterized as progressive developmental shifts—fares very well in empirical studies. Substantial evidence exists for both an in- creased probability that consideration will be given to identity alternatives and an in- creased probability that personally mean- ingful commitments will be formed. With respect to the timing of development, it ap- pears that only limited changes occur prior to or during the high school years. The most extensive advances in identity formation oc- cur during the time spent in college. (Not enough research has been conducted with noncollege samples of equivalent age to de- termine the relative contribution of ontoge- netic and situational variables to such changes.) The period immediately after col- lege appears most often to involve a consol- idation of the sense of identity rather than the continued exploration of identity alter- natives. Of the topic areas that may become the focus of identity concern, the greatest doc- umentation of progressive developmental shifts exists for vocational choice. Identity questions concerning sexual expression have not been studied longitudinally, but the high probability of the identity achievement sta- tus, at least among women, indicate similar progress in this area. Less consistency has been observed for the patterns of identity change in the areas of religious beliefs and political ideology, perhaps as a function of differences in the background characteristics of the participants in various studies or changing sociohistorical conditions. Comparisons of the patterns of identity formation shown by males and females yield far more evidence of similarities than dif- ferences. With respect to the processes of development, the sexes show generally sim- ilar probabilities of consideration of identity alternatives and establishment of commit- ments. Only in the area of attitudes toward premarital sexual activity are differences evident. Here, females appear more likely to go through a period of moratorium and achieve identity commitments; males are more likely to maintain the early commit- ments on which they had foreclosed. The similarities between the sexes in develop- mental processes do not contradict the sub- stantial evidence from other research that males and females differ in the content of their identity choices (Frieze, Parsons, John- son, Ruble, & Zellman, 1978). To date the research has yielded only lim- ited information with regard to the anteced- ents of developmental change. Although the findings concerning the relationship between parental behavior and the identity statuses of sons and daughters are consistent with theoretical expectations, there are a number 356 ALAN S. WATERMAN of alternative explanations available that do not involve a causal influence of the parental variables. Similarly, extensive data that are consistent with a hierarchical arrangement of Erikson's psychosocial stages exist, but the methodological limitations of the re- search do not permit a determination of the direction of effect. Only a couple of person- ality or activity variables have been identi- fied as predictive of the direction of future identity formation. What is needed at the present time is re- search that traces identity development over a relatively broad range of ages. In partic- ular, more information is needed about both the roots of identity in the years before and during high school and the nature of identity changes during the adult years. In addition, developmental research is particularly needed on samples that do not attend college. The use of cohort-sequential methodology (Schaie, 1965, 1970) would aid in the iden- tification of the generality of developmental patterns across cohorts. It is also recom- mended that longitudinal studies on identity development include the assessment of pos- sible predictor variables of identity change. Reference Notes 1. Marcia, J. E.
