{"path":"2025/Spring/SWO-201 - Intro to Social Work/Attachments/Final Presentation.docx.pdf","text":"SWO 201 Final Presentation (10%) Students must choose between volunteering at a social service site for 10 hours or interview a social worker about their pr ofessional experience. You must make your selection by week 3 and record your choice on the sign up sheet pr ovided by the instructor. Volunteer Experience If you choose this op tion, you are asked to pr ovide 10 hours of volunteer service at a social service agency in the community. You must inform the instructor where you will do your volunteer service, what you will be doing, and who will be your super visor (or the coordinator of volunteer services) by Week 5. You may select a site for your volunteer work based on your own interests in working with a particular popula tion or in a specific field of social work pr actice, but equally import ant is ease of access. Try to negotiate access to a site that will readily and quickly accep t volunteers. Examples include: food pan tries, donation sorting facilities, soup kitchens etc. If you need help selecting a social service agency for volunteering, please contact me early. Once your volunteer site is finalized, please send me an email with the site information and cop y your service site contact/super visor so I have their name. Please begin your volunteer hours soon after finalization so you comple te the 10 hours in time for your pr esentation in week 13 or 14. Oral Presentation (sug gested outline) - 10 minutes or less 1.

REFLECTIONS & CONCLUSION (3 poin ts) Conclude with a personal reflection regarding the lessons you learned about social services within this field of pr actice, or with the specific popula tion served. Social Worker Interview For this op tion, you will identify a pr ofessional social worker at either the BSW or MSW level and reques t their permission to interview them. You may select a social worker based on their field of pr actice, such as their work with the unhoused, in addiction/recovery treatment, health care, mental health, children and families, priv ate pr actice etc. You will also want to consider ease of access and how quickly the worker can schedule an interview with you. Once you have secured the social worker’s agreement, please send me an email and cop y them as well. You will want to conduct your interview early so that you can review their responses and pr epar e your pr esentation for either week 13 or 14.

INTERVIEW DETAILS (5 poin ts) Major areas of focus for the interview Summary of resonant responses Brief analysis of how the social worker’s report ed experience aligns (or not) with what you have learned about social work this semester 3. REFLECTIONS & CONCLUSION (3 poin ts) Conclude with a personal reflection regarding the lessons you learned about social work pr actice and whether you see yourself being able to engage in this kind of work. Other Considerations Before the interview, be sure you review the chap ter on values/confidentiality. Be certain to let your interviewees know: 1) that their names will be identified to the instructor, 2) that you will disguise their names in class pr esentation if they wish, and 3) that you are not expect ed to have any client contacts Plan to arrive 10 minutes early to observe the pr ocess of the agency in the waiting area. Here is a list of the suggested ques tions for you to ask. You undoubtedly will think of others: What is the mission and history of your agency? Who are the clients and what issues or challenges bring them to your agency? What does your agency do to meet the needs of the clients? How long have you been a social worker? How long have you worked at this agency? What motivated you to go into the field of social work? What is your job descrip tion? What do you like about working with this popula tion? How has your social work education helped you? What skills or techniques do you use? What is a typic al day like? What makes for a good day? A bad day? What qualities should a good social worker have in this setting? What are the frustrations and challenges of working in this field? What are the rewards? If you had to do it over again, would you choose social work? How do you separ ate your per sonal and pr ofessional life? What is your idea of an ideal social work job? With whom and where would you be working? If you could give one piece of advice for beginning social workers, what would it be? As soon as possible after the meeting, the interview should be summarized. Given the pr esentation time limit, you cannot include all of the information conveyed to you by the social worker, so you will need to be skillful in synthesizing what you consider to be the most import ant.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
