As your loan servicer, our goal is to help you stay on the path to successfully paying your student loans by keeping you informed. We’re happy to help you navigate your options, provide resources, and answer any questions you have as you repay these loans. Here’s a quick overview to help you get started on managing your loans. Manage your account online If you haven’t already, create your account online at Aidvantage.studentaid.gov for easy online access to your account information. Check out your loan details, sign up for eDelivery, make payments, view available repayment options, and much more. What you need to know When it’s time to begin repaying your loans, we’ll send you your billing statement along with payment instructions. Remember, if your loans aren’t subsidized, you’re responsible for paying all interest that accrues, including while you’re in school. We’ll send you quarterly interest statements to let you know how much interest your loans have accrued. All unpaid Accrued Interest will be added to the principal balance when your loans enter repayment. Sign up for eDelivery today On your Aidvantage.studentaid.gov profile page, provide your email address and indicate you want to sign up for eDelivery. What you can do now Pay a little now, save a lot later. Our goal is to be the best partner we can by assisting you in understanding and paying your student loans. We encourage you to make payments (no matter how small) to reduce your total loan cost. By making payments now, you can reduce the amount of interest paid over the life of your loan. Auto Pay enrollment Enroll in Auto Pay to have payments automatically deducted from your bank account on your payment due date. This helps you make your payments on time. During periods when you make monthly payments with Auto Pay, you will get a 0.25% interest rate reduction on those student loans. Repayment options When your student loan repayment begins, find a repayment plan that fits your needs and goals at StudentAid.gov/loan-simulator. In some cases, a repayment plan based on your income and family size can help you manage your federal student loan payments. While certain eligibility conditions apply, you could potentially reduce your monthly payment to as low as $0. Once you find a plan that works for you, you can apply for it online. Loan forgiveness In certain situations, you can have your federal student loans forgiven, canceled, or discharged. That means you won’t have to pay back some or all of your loan(s). To learn more about Federal Student Aid’s loan forgiveness programs, including Teacher Loan Forgiveness (TLF) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), visit https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation. We’re here to help If you have any questions about your account or your options, visit us online at Aidvantage.studentaid.gov or give us a call at 800-722-1300. Our hours of operation can be found online at Aidvantage.studentaid.gov/contact-us. Important disclosure(s) Electronic check conversion When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. Important Fair Credit Reporting Act Notice The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires us to notify you that we may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. Privacy Notice Federal law requires the U.S. Department of Education (Dept. of Ed) to make available to you information on how it collects, shares, and protects your personal information. The Dept of Ed’s privacy notice has not changed since it was last provided to you. You may access Dept of Ed’s privacy notice at Aidvantage.studentaid.gov/protecting-your-privacy or we will mail you a free copy upon request if you call us at 800-722-1300. Teacher Loan Forgiveness If you teach full-time for five complete and consecutive academic years in a low-income elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency, you may be eligible for forgiveness of up to $5,000 (or up to $17,500 if you meet the criteria of a highly qualified teacher) on your Direct or FFELP loans. See StudentAid.gov/teach-forgive for more information and a form you can fill out when you have completed your teaching service. Review of payment schedule Periodically, we review accounts and adjust Monthly Payment Amounts to ensure that loans will be paid off within their repayment terms. We will inform you of any such change before the new Monthly Payment Amount is due.
