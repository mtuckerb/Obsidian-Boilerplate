Keywords: access | Indonesia | institutions | livelihoods | sea space | seaweed ABSTRACT Indonesia is the world's largest producer of carrageenan seaweed, the cultivation of which is dominated by household operators and is transforming livelihoods in many coastal communities. Growing demand from the global food processing sector has rap- idly transformed Indonesian coastal sea space into a commoditized livelihood resource, where access is governed by emergent, and highly fluid, institutions. Through an extensive ethnographic study in two coastal villages in South Sulawesi, we show how a new property rights regime is being created through evolving institutions of access (both formal and informal) in continual feedback with the livelihood strategies pursued by individual households. The ability to benefit from access to sea space, during a price boom, emerges from within multiple strands of intersecting power relations, producing a range of livelihood outcomes. This study contributes to debates on how rural livelihood opportunities are infused by the politics of access to natural resources, thus reshaping processes of agrarian change in coastal regions. 1 | Introduction Access to natural resources remains vital for rural livelihoods across the world, including many who are engaged with agri- culture and fisheries. A rich body of literature has documented the dynamics of land access and property in rural areas of the Global South because of increased resource commoditization1 (e.g., see Sikor and Tuong Vi 2005; Rigg 2006; McCarthy 2007; Hall, Hirsch, and Li  2011; McCarthy, Vel, and Afiff  2012; Li 2014). Although access to sea space is an equally crucial live- lihood resource for many coastal households, research exam- ining the institutions governing access to sea space is limited. Yet, the incorporation of various marine commodities within industrialized global value chains has resulted in the increased penetration of capitalism into this realm (Campling, Havice, and McCall Howard  2012; Fabinyi et  al.  2022; Rahmat and Neilson 2023), with differentiated implications for access to sea space within local communities. Seaweed farming, mostly by household producers, has boomed in recent decades, with Indonesia responsible for an estimated 81% of global carrageenan production in 2021 (FishStat FAO 2023). Carrageenan is a gel extracted from certain seaweeds, which is now used as a thickener or stabilizer in an array of pro- cessed foods, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The expanding global food processing sector has been the key engine of global © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. 2 of 16 Journal of Agrarian Change, 2024 demand, which has led to particularly rapid industry expansion since 2000 (Langford  2024). Indonesian seaweed farmers sell dried seaweed to local traders, who have often provided them with loans for both production and personal purposes. Traders then sell to exporters, usually based in a provincial capital like Makassar, from where it is exported as either an unprocessed product (65% by volume in 2021) or processed into semirefined or refined carrageenan. Although western markets remain import- ant end- users and were responsible for initial demand creation, an estimated 83% of Indonesia's carrageenan products went to China in 2021 for further processing, and Chinese buyers have also invested in Indonesia- based processing (Zhang et al. 2024). With production increasing 10- fold from 2005 to 2021 (FishStat FAO 2023), the industry was estimated to directly support the livelihoods of approximately 62,000 producer households across Indonesia in 2021 (BPS 2022), with a similar number of work- ers estimated to be employed casually as village- based seaweed binders (Langford et al. 2024). This paper explores the evolution of institutions governing access to sea space in two coastal villages in South Sulawesi, Indonesia's largest seaweed- producing province. Such access has become an important livelihood resource, and the paper analyses the dynamic interplay between power, authority and daily practices that constitute (highly fluid) access regimes. In Section 2, we outline the theoretical framework used in our analysis and highlight our contribution to an improved under- standing of the political economy of rural livelihoods (as urged by, amongst others, Scoones  2015 and Natarajan et  al.  2022). We do this through an enhanced consideration of access the- ory (Ribot and Peluso 2003; Peluso and Ribot 2020; Myers and Hansen  2020). Section  3 describes the methods we used, and Section  4 provides a brief description of livelihood patterns in our two case study villages. Section 5 examines the shifting ac- cess mechanisms that have enabled sea space to become a criti- cal livelihood resource in these villages, highlighting its growing commoditization. Section 6 then analyses the dynamic institu- tions that are governing access to sea space and how they have evolved in response to resource conflict and the changing live- lihood strategies of households. Section 7 concludes the paper. 2 | Institutions of Access to Livelihood Resources The sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) was a helpful actor- oriented approach to understand rural development and agrar- ian change (see Chambers and Conway 1991; Scoones 1998), as a corrective to prior accounts of development that over- emphasized structural constraints in a deterministic way. It shined a light on the lived realities of the rural poor, who, rather than possessing ‘a job’ in the formal sense of the word, often pursued a range of livelihood activities, ranging from self- provisioning, petty com- modity production, small- scale trading, off- farm work, social ex- changes and as remittance recipients. However, the framework has also been critiqued for its lack of attention to agrarian polit- ical economy, resulting in calls to ‘bring the politics back in’ to a framework that was considered to overemphasize individual- ism and agency (O'Laughlin 2002; Scoones 2009; Scoones 2015; Vicol 2019; Natarajan et al. 2022). The original SLF highlighted how households assembled livelihood resources (the so- called five ‘capitals’—natural, financial, social, human and physical) to construct a ‘livelihood strategy’. Scoones  (1998, 8, emphasis added) reminded us how ‘different people clearly have different access to different livelihood resources … [and that] … a socially differentiated view to analysing livelihoods is therefore criti- cal’. In response to criticisms that assessing access as part of an ‘institutional context’ insufficiently addressed power as a rela- tional concept, Scoones (2009, 186) later conceded that a ‘more explicit theorization of politics, power and social difference is thus required’. This concern was also at the core of Natarajan et al.'s (2022), 11) recent critique that ‘[i]nfluence and access are probably the least discussed aspects of the SLF’, leading to their reformulation where the ‘politics of influence and access’ is af- forded more weight as a cross- cutting livelihood theme. Given the apparent weaknesses of the SLF in incorporating the politics of access, it is somewhat surprising that attempts to analyse access to livelihood resources within the SLF have not drawn more extensively upon Ribot and Peluso's (2003) theory of access, another influential framework where access is presented as a ‘bundle of powers’. Reviewing applications of a theory of access, Myers and Hansen (2020) identify similarities with the livelihoods framework but were ‘struck by how challenging this fit is in practice’ (p. 152) and how the SLF has ‘proven elusive to operationalization together with a theory of access’ (p. 160). Scoones (2015) similarly suggests the potential insights to live- lihood analysis offered by drawing upon a theory of access but makes no attempt to develop this conceptually or to demonstrate its practical utility. In this paper, we thus seek to contribute to the political economy of rural livelihoods by a detailed case- based consideration of how institutions of access to livelihood resources (and sea space in particular) are negotiated and con- structed in practice and to reflect on what implication this has for ‘livelihoods in flux’ (Natarajan et al. 2022). We highlight not only the dynamic nature of contemporary rural livelihoods but also how this dynamism itself is part of the matrix that feeds back to reconstruct institutions of access. This is consistent with Ribot (1998), who argued that analysis of access should be em- pirical, examining the observed practice without presuming any set of rights, structures and processes that produce this ability. Or, as expressed by Juul and Lund (2002, 4) ‘property regimes are not ‘things’ which are there or not, they are what people do’. We highlight the active role of local participants in constructing institutions of access. At the same time, many studies on local institutions are infused with ‘idealization’ of traditional and cus- tomary marine tenure arrangements (e.g., Ruddle, Hviding, and Johannes 1992; Pomeroy 1995; Cinner 2005; Syakur et al. 2012; Purnomo et  al.  2020). Although these studies have often high- lighted the potential for community- based natural resource management (CBNRM; see also Ostrom  1990; Pomeroy  1995; Allison and Ellis 2001), they often overlook the political economy surrounding resource access (adopting what Campling, Havice, and McCall Howard  2012 dismiss as a neo- populist approach). Structural and relational powers retain important roles in shaping access to resources and the ways benefits are distributed. We in- corporate these broader structural relations by building not only on the work of Ribot and Peluso (2003); Peluso and Ribot 2020) but also borrowing from Lund (2021, 2023) on legalization and authority, thus continuing a key theme (the role of the state) em- phasized by Campling, Havice, and McCall Howard  (2012) in their examination of the political economy of capture fisheries. 14710366, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joac.12617 by Moss Landing Marine Labs, Wiley Online Library on [04/03/2025].

Applied to our case, it enables us to unpack the complex power relations between different groups that characterize the growing commoditization of sea space. The concept of access is defined as the ability of actors to benefit from things (Ribot and Peluso  2003). This defini- tion is broader than the idea of property, which is based on the right to benefit from things (Macpherson  1978). Expanding Maine's (1917) ‘bundle of rights’, Ghani (1995) suggested ‘bun- dles of power’ to represent property relations, as understood within a political–economic framework. Developing the con- cept of a ‘bundle of powers’ further, Ribot and Peluso (2003) suggested a focus on specific ‘access mechanisms’, including both access rights (property relations) as well as structural and relational factors such as technology, knowledge (dis- cursive power), capital, market, labour and labour opportu- nities, social identity and authority. These are some of the ‘means, processes, and relations by which actors are enabled to gain, control, and maintain access to resources’ (Ribot and Peluso 2003, 160). These mechanisms were never meant to be an exhaustive list, and Agyei, Hansen, and Acheampong (2020) have usefully added force, moral economy, social movement and innovation to the repertoire. Relatedly, Hall, Hirsch, and Li (2011) identify four ‘powers of exclusion’ (in some ways, the inverse of access) through markets, force, regulation and dis- course. We argue that many of these structural and relational mechanisms are also analogous to the livelihood resources identified in the SLF (notably financial, physical, human and social capitals), at least when analysed relationally. The key point is that access to livelihood resources emerges from within existing, and evolving, social relations. Property relations remain a key determinant of the ability to ac- cess resources, and these too are also embedded within evolving power structures and are intimately linked to the authority and legitimacy of actors in societies. Sikor and Lund (2009, 9), how- ever, highlight how legitimacy ‘is not a fixed and finite substance’. It varies between and within cultures and is continuously (re- )es- tablished through conflict and negotiation over time. To continue ‘having access’ or ‘having property’, users need to maintain and defend their position in a process of ongoing assertion. This is especially true in contexts of legal pluralism (as in Indonesia), resulting in processes of ‘forum shopping’ and ‘shopping forums’ where actors ‘shop’ for forums for dispute resolution, and forums actively shop for disputes to consolidate their authority (von Benda- Beckmann 1981; Anying and Gausset 2017). Notwithstanding such fluidity, pluralism and the multiple access mechanisms through which power is asserted, the state often looms large as the most important source of authority. Lund (2021) stresses how formal legal rights, backed up by state power, re- main important, particularly when access is challenged. In his book Nine- Tenths of the Law, Lund (2021) explores how and why actors work to make claims stick by legalizing them. The practice of resource appropriation or ‘accessing’ within informal rules, what Lund calls ‘possession’, is not yet represented as a right. Possession might be nine- tenths of the law, but the other one- tenth still matters, driving a desire for legalization and inviting state power to protect a claim (Lund 2021, 2023). Interestingly, a diverse range of written forms of state recognition can provide an ‘air of legality’ for claimants who, as Benton (2012, 29) points out, ‘actively reference state law, however inaccurately or oppor- tunistically’. Invoking state power, however, involves consider- able risk. Under predatory states, as Lund  (2021, 3) points out, ‘law has often been the handmaiden of power and instrumen- tal in plunder’, leading to dispossession of local people. In our Indonesian case studies, the role and legitimacy of the state as an arbitrator of sea rights has been relatively suppressed to date, but there are signs that it is, almost inevitably, becoming embroiled in the institutions governing resource access. The specific characteristics of a resource will also affect the institutions of access. Sea space has a complex socio- economic and political history of access and property relations, despite often being oversimplified as open access. Campling and Havice (2014) argue that the ‘tragedy of the commons’ narrative over- looks the active role of states in shaping property relations on the sea. They highlight how the establishment of exclusive eco- nomic zones (EEZs) in the 1970s transformed coastal states into ‘state- landed property’ holders, granting them control and enabling rent- seeking through fishing access fees and quotas, with developed countries often dictating these terms through their superior economic and political power. In Southeast Asia, Butcher (2004) illustrates how intensified, market- driven fish- ing post- WWII led to resource depletion and regulatory expan- sion by the 1990s, with states implementing stricter regulations to manage fisheries—though fishers often found ways around these restrictions. Thus, Butcher (2004) argues that Southeast Asia's complex governance dynamic emerges from the dynamic interaction between state policies, local practices and ecological factors. Access and property relations in sea space are further compli- cated by the ocean's multiresource nature, seasonal dynam- ics and the difficulty of clear territorial division (Adger and Luttrell  2000; Langford et  al.  2022). Many marine commod- ities are mobile, such that the allocation and management of extraction rights are fraught (Campling, Havice, and McCall Howard 2012; Ruhon, Walyandra, and Langford 2024) and total exclusion difficult to accomplish, making especially dynamic access and property relations. Our case study is important given the relative lack of legal certainty over natural resource man- agement in these coastal environments and the highly dynamic relationship between state- backed rights, evolving community norms and livelihood change. 3 | Methods Our analysis is based on two village case studies undertaken in 2021 and 2022 in the districts of Takalar and Pangkep on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi (Figure  1). The case study approach permitted us to explore and provide an in- depth un- derstanding of the emerging institutions governing access to sea space and how this was situated in context (Yin  2012). Of Indonesia's 33 provinces in 2013, South Sulawesi was home to 11% of the nation's marine fisheries- involved households (the largest share nationally) according to the 2013 Agricultural Census (BPS 2013). Within this province, Pangkep had the high- est number. The two villages were selected because of their sig- nificant engagement in seaweed farming. 14710366, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joac.12617 by Moss Landing Marine Labs, Wiley Online Library on [04/03/2025].

Four of the authors had been collecting data on seaweed- related topics in the villages 6 months before specific questioning on resource access commenced. A total of 122 semistructured interviews were conducted in the two villages. Interviewees were 74% male and 26% female, whose age structures, socio- economic status and livelihood activities were proportional to the village populations. Some interviews were con- ducted in group settings, but most were individual, and repeat in- terviews were common. The interviews were conducted through face- to- face interactions at the homes of the interviewees, at the beach, pier, seaweed tying places and other small gathering places. Additionally, we use data from a survey we conducted in 2021 covering 273 seaweed farming households (177 in Laikang and 96 in Pitu Sunggu) selected through random sampling tech- niques (the results of which are reported in Langford et al. 2024). We reviewed relevant documents such as government policies, regulations and reports, as well as industry reports and online news to understand formal institutional arrangements on the management of sea space and its evolution and how they in- teract with industry actors. Interviews with 10 government of- ficials and large industry actors were conducted, many in the provincial capital of Makassar, to understand the intent and im- plementation of these regulations. 4 | Case Study Sites 4.1 | Laikang Laikang is the southernmost village of Takalar Regency, situ- ated in a productive bay with waters opening to the Flores Sea (Figure 1). The village land area is 19.6 km2 with a coastline of approximately 8 km, along which three of the village's six ham- lets (dusun) are located (BPS Kabupaten Takalar 2020). In 2020, almost 2000 resident households were recorded in the adminis- trative village, most of whom were ethnic Makassar (Laikang Village Profile  2021). We were told how the village was once ruled by a local nobility known as karaeng, who claimed own- ership over land resources in the village, which were worked by ‘commoners’. Following Indonesian independence, and notwith- standing nationalist pressures to abolish ‘feudalism’, this nobil- ity continued to retain control over significant land resources. Even after the establishment of a formal village administration (the smallest unit of state control), village heads in Laikang con- tinued to be chosen from the karaeng. The introduction of dem- ocratic village elections in 2005, coupled with increasing market integration and livelihood diversification, has partially shifted the power from the karaengs to wealthy individuals (the two categories are no longer perfectly aligned). In 2022, the village leader was the first non- karaeng who had been elected, but his family are some of the largest seaweed traders in the village. Seaweed farming and small- scale commercial fishing (mainly for blue swimmer crab) now perform crucial roles in sustaining livelihoods, alongside fishing for own consumption. As recently as the 1990s, however, land- based farming (rice, corn, cassava, sweet potatoes) was the main livelihood activity in the village, but it was deeply intersected with unequal class positions. Not all households owned land and sharecropping was common. Bayside residents were required to walk several hours each day and some built semi- permanent houses at these farms, whereas those who could afford it bought bicycles to better combine farming with fishing. Households living near the shore, where soils were less fertile, would balance farming with subsistence- oriented fishing. Fishing activities were only pursued in the three coastal hamlets and fishing activities required (relatively minor) investments in basic wooden boats or fish traps (dis- cussed further in Section  5). Landless households generally sustained their livelihoods through capture fisheries combined with on- farm labouring and seasonal migration to urban areas (mostly as becak drivers and construction workers). In the late 1980s, a select few households (mostly landown- ers) became engaged in brackishwater aquaculture (known as tambak), where they farmed shrimp and milkfish, with a small number becoming relatively wealthy as a result. These affluent households were also amongst the pioneers who first claimed sea space and adopted seaweed farming during its early development in the 1990s. Our 2021 survey of sea- weed farmers found that half started seaweed farming before 1999. Although it eventually became more profitable than land- based farming, it was adopted by households living in the three coastal hamlets only. Even in areas adjacent to the bay, seaweed farming was not accessible to all and required the right combination of access mechanisms (discussed in Section 5). Many households who missed the seaweed boom sustained their livelihoods through capture fisheries, including crab, pelagic fish and sea cucumber (alongside nonfishing activities). Diving for sea cucumber was an activity pursued by some of the poorer households as it entailed the least capital but involved consid- erable health risk (such as loss of hearing). Commercial crab fishing (blue swimmer crab) is another important livelihood ac- tivity that requires limited capital. Crab fishers sell to local col- lectors and processing units, who then sell on to exporters and into global value chains. In practice, there is considerable liveli- hood diversification within households. For diversified middle- income households, income from crabs (and other fish) is used for daily consumption, whereas income from seaweed is used for accumulation and for consumption on larger items like house renovations and vehicle purchases. More recently, the better- off households in Laikang (including many seaweed pioneers) have started to diversify again, into activities such as seaweed trading, crab processing and lobster mariculture. Furthermore, gaining access to state- funded development projects was being vigor- ously contested amongst village elites during our fieldwork. A 2014 Village Law legally mandated a significant increase in the value of cash transfers into Indonesian villages and this has in- tensified power contestation within the community. In 2021 and 2022, Laikang village received cash transfers of 2.58 billion IDR (Indonesian Rupiah, around 164,000 USD) and 2.36 billion IDR (around 150,000 USD) from the central government.2[Correc- tion added on 14 January 2025, after first online publication: In the last sentence of sub-section 4.1, the phrases ‘rupiah (around 164,000 USD)’ and ‘rupiah (around 150,000 USD)’ have been changed to ‘IDR (Indonesian Rupiah, around 164,000 USD)’ and ‘IDR (around 150,000 USD)’, respectively.] 14710366, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joac.12617 by Moss Landing Marine Labs, Wiley Online Library on [04/03/2025].

It consists of three hamlets: one adjacent to the shore, the second further in- land but with access to the sea via a small river, and the third nearer the highway. All hamlets have a history of agricultural production. The village covers a smaller land area of 3.65 km2 (BPS Kabupaten Pangkep 2020) and a coastline of approximately 800 m . In 2020, the village was inhabited by 642 households (Pitu Sunggu Village Profile 2020), most of whom were ethnically Bugis. By the end of 2022, an estimated 181 of these households were farming seaweed, the majority living in the coastal hamlet. Households with access to land previously pursued livelihoods from farming. Similar to Laikang, rice, corn, cassava and sweet potatoes were the main crops cultivated, but rice farming was dominant. Rice fields were unequally distributed amongst the villagers (and even held by non- residents), and wealth status was closely aligned with land own- ership. Many of these landowners resided in the inland hamlet of Bonto Sunggu, whereas landless households were concentrated in the coastal and river- facing hamlets, where their livelihoods could be supported by fishing activities. Many worked as farm labourers and sharecroppers. Involvement in rice farming was pursued alongside fishing, mainly for subsistence or for the local market, with some better- off households engaged in interisland trading (the heavily populated Spermonde archipelago is located a few kilometres offshore). Poorer households, with less access to land and other capital, sustained their livelihoods mainly from fishing for rebon shrimp (processed into shrimp paste) and clams (sold to local restaurants) in shallow coastal waters (with or without a boat, often using homemade traps). Women (and children) provided both unpaid labour for various tasks (crafts, maintaining fishing gear, processing fish and selling to neighbours or local markets) and as paid labour for other farmers and fishermen. Some boat owners would also catch fish using trawl nets (pukat), although declining stocks made this less profitable over time. Villages recounted how, during earlier periods, incidents of fishermen losing their lives to currents or succumbing to large waves were common, rendering their family (usually wives and children) vulnerable. Some men from poorer households migrated to other regions, mostly to resource frontier areas such as Kalimantan or Papua while their wives stayed behind. When individuals in Laikang started to farm seaweed in the mid- 1990s, Pitu Sunggu was experiencing a shrimp boom (black tiger shrimp). A dramatic transformation of the village landscape took place, starting in the 1980s, driven partly by salinization of rice fields, which were converted to tambak ponds (mainly for shrimp). With each conversion, the seepage of saltwater spread, eventually making large areas ill- suited for rice. The shrimp boom was fuelled by global demand, driven primarily by increased seafood consumption in the United States and Japan, and gener- ated windfall profits during the 1997/98 Asian Financial Crisis (because of rampant currency devaluation). However, this boom was largely enjoyed by landowners. As a result, these households accumulated wealth, rebuilt or renovated their houses, purchased vehicles or more land, sent their children to university or ful- filled social and cultural aspirations (ceremonial activities, haj pilgrimage). The village leadership class today typically comes from well- educated tambak households. The conversion to tam- bak, however, increased livelihood precarity for landless house- holds who had relied on farm labouring for subsistence. Suharsih, the widow of a man who died at sea, recounted losing such labour opportunities, such that she subsequently relied on the harvesting of wild marine resources, particularly rebon shrimp and clams. Migration became an important alternative strategy for others, particularly for younger men during the fishing off- season. Unsustainable tambak practices subsequently led to disease out- breaks and environmental deterioration. Although tambak were quickly abandoned in Laikang, tambak farmers in Pitu Sunggu have continued to cultivate new disease- resistant species (L. vannamei) and it retains some livelihood importance. Seaweed cultivation was taken up in Pitu Sunggu later than in Laikang (starting around 2007, with two- thirds of cultivators commenc- ing after 2010). Although tambak farmers were amongst those pioneers who adopted seaweed farming, 80% of seaweed farm- ers (in our 2021 survey) reported that they were previously en- gaged in capture fisheries, with the largest number of cultivators found in the predominantly nonlandowning coastal hamlet of Pungkalawaki. The muddy shoreline and mangrove barrier pre- sented a greater access challenge than in Laikang, and seaweed farmers typically needed a small motorboat to access seaweed locations, such that the transition was easier for existing fishers. At the time of fieldwork, livelihoods in Pitu Sunggu were thus varied and dynamic, with individual households often involved in diverse activities. As seaweed cultivation became more prof- itable over time as prices generally increased (notwithstanding considerable price fluctuations in a still immature global mar- ket), cultivators reduced their capital and labour allocations for other activities, such as crewing long- distance fishing boats, tam- bak farming and migration. During 2021–2022, shrimp farming was declining as seaweed farming grew in response to a post- COVID- 19 price boom that lasted from mid- 2021 to mid- 2023, and the most affluent tambak households had diversified into trading (shrimp, crab, seaweed and household goods), transforming it into their primary income source, whereas many of their children (who benefitted from higher education) had secured off- farm jobs. The poorest households, who lacked access to both land and sea- weed cultivation areas, depended predominantly on wild- caught fisheries in the shallow coastal waters (crabs, clams and rebon shrimp). Although crabbing can be pursued by poorer households, it was also maintained by many seaweed cultivators who found it complementary with seaweed farming. Seasonal migration had declined as seaweed production created significant local demand for labour (discussed more in the next section). Another grow- ing labour opportunity within the village during 2021–2022 was casual employment at crab processing facilities. As is common across rural Indonesia, increased overall wealth levels in both vil- lages have stimulated demand for basic service provisioning and livelihood opportunities for kiosk and food store operators, mobile phone providers, beauty salons, mechanics and others. Our discussion of livelihood strategies in the two villages sug- gests considerable change over time determined largely by ac- cess to a range of material and non- material livelihood assets. We have sought to present these strategies as reflecting general- ized wealth categories (poorer, middle- income, better off) based 14710366, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joac.12617 by Moss Landing Marine Labs, Wiley Online Library on [04/03/2025].

A summary of the various types of livelihood strategies pursued by households from different wealth categories, and their evo- lution, is presented in Table  1. Better- off households typically have access to productive land assets, financial capital and bet- ter education and knowledge and possess social and political influence that frequently facilitates access to other resources. Middle- income households are still likely to have access to some land or sea space, whereas poorer households are often landless, miss out on opportunities to access sea space and have limited access to other resources. As a result, they depend heavily on coastal and marine commons and on their own labour to meet subsistence needs amid restricted economic opportunities. The evolution of household livelihoods is not always linear. A few middle- income households successfully moved up the socio- economic ladder by capitalizing on early boom periods in seaweed and crab trading, facilitated by timely access to market knowledge and networks. 5 | Mechanisms of Accessing Sea Space This section reviews the historical development of access to sea space following the fluctuations of global seaweed prices, then analyses different access mechanisms used by villagers, as identified by Ribot and Peluso (2003), including social identity, market, knowledge, technology, labour and labour opportuni- ties, capitals and authority. In so doing, we also show how these mechanisms relate to the livelihood resources (human, physical, natural, social and financial capitals) widely used in the SLF. Prior to the cultivation of seaweed, sea space in the villages was generally considered a common property, to which all villagers had access for fishing and collection of other marine resources. Informants in both villages were unanimous that there were no restrictions on such activities and, as already highlighted, these activities were generally pursued by poorer households with few alternatives. There were, however, some important instances where villagers asserted more exclusive claims over sea space. In Laikang Bay, the morphology of the coast allowed villagers to build semi- permanent fish traps made of bamboo and nets called serobila (Figure 2) and bagang (Figure 3), requiring areas of ap- proximately 100 and 50 m2, respectively, both usually located within 200 m from the shore (accessible by rowboats or wading). Other more temporary sea uses included crab traps or gill nets, which were commonly left overnight or moved around to follow fish migration flows. A ‘first come first served’ principle applied to these uses, and bagang and serobila were constructed by any villager with the resources (mainly their own labour) to do so. Within the community, investments of labour (and capital) were legitimate mechanisms to claim access rights, and this socially sanctioned practice became an entrenched social institution. As argued by Scoones (2015, 54), ‘practices create institutions, just as institutions create practices’. Although there was no formal recognition of these claims by the state or village administra- tion, in daily speech, villagers used words like ‘own’ (milik) or ‘have’ (punya) when referring to these claims. Indeed, labour and capital remained the most important mechanisms in access- ing sea space in the following years, as we shall see. Rules around bagang and serobila were extensions to the rela- tively open access right to collect marine resources. They were also important institutional precursors to seaweed cultivation claims, which followed the same principles and discourse of rel- ative open access. However, in practice, access was not entirely open and, in both villages, it presupposed a social identity as a ‘local’, or what Blaikie (1989) referred to as ‘access qualifications’. An estimated 90% of seaweed cultivators across Indonesia say that their main seaweed cultivating location is within their own village (BPS 2022), although in some areas it is also common to cultivate in non- native villages. Although in the early years, migrants found it possible to claim sea space, social identity as an access mecha- nism became more important in recent years as access to sea space became increasingly valuable. Ribot and Peluso (2003) also identi- fied social identity as one of their structural and relational access mechanisms (see also discussions on social identity during com- mons enclosures by Menzies 1988). In our case studies, latecomers (and some outsiders) who sought access had to negotiate their way through community social structures, as we shall see.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License8 of 16 Journal of Agrarian Change, 2024 During this early period, the market value of the catch from fish traps, which was either used for direct consumption or sold into local markets, was low compared with the investment (particu- larly labour) required. Competition and conflict over sea space were rare. Although a fuller examination of downstream sea- weed market dynamics is beyond the scope of this paper (it is examined in Waldron et al. 2024 and Zhang et al. 2024), grow- ing demand for seaweed was fuelled by growth in demand for gelling, thickening and stabilizing additives by the global food processing sector (Zhang et  al.  2024) as well as significant re- duction in seaweed processing costs with the introduction of low- cost semirefined carrageenan processing technologies in the 1990s (Langford  2024). In Laikang, in the 1990s (later for Pitu Sunggu), a few people, often owners of bagang or sero- bila, started to cultivate seaweed using floating bamboo rafts. These efforts were highly speculative, as recorded by Hatta and Purnomo (1994), the price of seaweed during this time was only 450-600 IDR per kilogramme in harbour cities (~25 US cents). Since then, prices have risen dramatically but not consistently (Langford et al. 2023, 29), with a notable increase during 2012– 2014, followed by a period of fluctuation, before jumping again in the late 2017 with the opening of a large Chinese carrageenan processor in South Sulawesi (Jasuda 2024). Subsequently, price declined gradually through the 2020–2021 COVID- 19 pandemic FIGURE 2 | Top view of serobila (top); close- up (bottom).

They fell again throughout late 2022 and early 2023 and, by mid- 2023, had fallen to levels not seen since 2017. By 2014, villagers at both sites were vying to establish lokasi or pondasi (the local terms used somewhat interchangeably to refer to a claim; Figure 4). Many migrants returned to the villages. Each subsequent price hike fuelled further attempts to establish lo- kasi or to secure benefits from prior claims and those with better access to capital and labour were at a distinct advantage. In the mid- 2000s, changes in farming technology altered mech- anisms of accessing sea space. Introduced by District Fisheries Offices, stretches of rope were being used to cultivate seaweed (replacing bamboo rafts), making it easier to grow and allowing expansion further offshore. Labour and capital, however, were the essential inputs and could initially be met through household labour and locally sourced/purchased materials (such as wood), although boats greatly aided physical access. As the scale of production grew, increased access to capital (to purchase ropes, seed and to pay seed- binding labour) was needed to claim larger or multiple areas of sea space and to put these into production. Although wealthier households were best positioned to exploit this opportunity, many fishers in the coastal hamlets were also assisted through loans provided by downstream traders (who they were subsequently expected to supply with seaweed) and participation was reasonably broad (see Neish et  al.  2017 for nationwide trends). As it became clear that seaweed cultiva- tion could be profitable, there were some reports of speculation, whereby lokasi were claimed with foundations but not brought into production. Indeed, many of the claimed locations were un- derutilized because of lack of labour, whereas others were sim- ply in unfavourable natural environments. Household labour is generally sufficient to set out the lines, maintain boats and FIGURE 3 | Bagang (1) and lobster cages (2) with floating houses for nightwatch (3) next to a seaweed lokasi (4).

However, seed needs to be carefully tied to lines prior to laying them out in the sea, and this needs to be undertaken immediately after the prior harvest to avoid seedling damage. During 2022, paid village labour was no longer sufficient to satisfy demand for seaweed binding and seaweed was being sent to neighbouring villages further inland for binding (often facilitated by labour agents). Almost all (94%) seaweed farmers in Pitu Sunggu reported using paid labour to complete binding work, and these opportunities became an im- portant livelihood activity within the village, particularly for women who preferred working in groups in the shade rather than on the water or in the fields. By around 2014, the most productive and accessible seaweed loca- tions in both villages had been claimed and sea space was fast be- coming a valuable asset, where initial claimants were controlling access for others. This involved a process of ongoing commoditiza- tion through three main mechanisms: selling, leasing and share- cropping. Villagers generally use the term ‘compensation’ (ganti rugi) when selling. Samsul (male, mid- 50s and a Laikang seaweed pioneer) explained, ‘we are not selling the sea because the sea is owned by the state. We only have rights to use it. But we must pay compensation to those who invested capital and labour to create the location in the first place. I think this is fair’. Nevertheless, the value of this ‘compensation’ does not simply correspond to invest- ment costs. Rather, it relates to the market value of the lokasi as determined by its distance from the shore, historical yields and susceptibility to disease, and fluctuating market prices. Moreover, these access claims were considered permanent by some respon- dents, who expressed their confidence that their children would inherit their lokasi. As we shall see, however, this was contested by others. Social identity was not a strict requirement for participation in these markets, but social networks remained important. Nurdin (male, early 40s and an outsider married to a local woman in Laikang) bought a lokasi for 3 million rupiah in 2017 (100 lines, compared with the village average of around 300 lines). There was no written evidence of this transaction. He and his wife also worked as seaweed binders for their neighbours. Nurdin told us: ‘I used to work as a rice farmer in my village but it was so hard to earn money and it was so much effort. After I got married, I decided to stay in Laikang because of seaweed farming. Earning money from the sea is much easier than earning money from land.’ Those present at the interview agreed that Nurdin's lokasi could (in 2022) be sold for four to five million IDR. [Correction added on 14 January 2025, after first online publication: ‘rupiah’ has been changed to ‘IDR’ in the preceding sentence.] Another better- off outsider (Idris, from Kalimantan) moved to Laikang in 2018 to purchase seaweed locations with the help of distant rel- atives in Laikang. Idris brought six nephews and nieces (mostly late teenagers) to live with him. He then instituted a sharecrop- ping mechanism with them on his lokasi, involving contributions (from Idris) of labour, ropes, plastic bottles and seed. Bahar (male, late- 30s), meanwhile, now prefers to work off- farm (driving his own car), whereas a neighbour cultivates seaweed on his lokasi, providing his own labour and ropes (Bahar provides propagules). They share the proceeds. Those lacking initial resources (or those who returned to the villages after the boom) thus had to negotiate access to the benefits of seaweed through purchasing, leasing or sharecropping, or simply working as labourers. Others obtained temporary access through ‘borrowing’ mecha- nisms, often from family or by maintaining relationships with ear- lier claimants. Acts of lending (or gifting) lokasi were considered an act of ‘helping’ that instilled a sense of gratitude in the receiving party, often establishing a patron–client relationship. Dirman ex- plained, ‘I lent my location to others because maybe I will need their help someday in the future’, and Yusuf, ‘I lent some of my lo- kasi to a relative and he sometimes give me seed or dried seaweed even though I never ask’. A related theme during interviews was the strength of social values within the villages. An early pioneer, Irfan, stated that ‘everyone in this community is indeed family’, whereas Samsul told us that ‘we [the community] help each other. I had some locations that I did not use so I shared them with my family and relatives who needed it’. Although such values do in- deed appear to be strong in these communities, a mid- 50s seaweed farmer living in an earthen- floored house complained that ‘the rich get richer because they get most benefits [from seaweed farm- ing] but we are not going anywhere’. His income from seaweed farming was just enough to cover basic necessities because of its small size and his lack of capital to purchase good quality seed, pay seed- binding labour and to properly dry his harvest. Based on our 2021 survey, sea space was unequally distributed in the two villages (albeit moderately so), with the top 25% of seaweed farmers (by lokasi size) producing 51% of the seaweed, whereas the bottom 25% produced just 6%. As sea space became increasingly commoditized and seaweed farming became more capitalized, it contributed to social differentiation within the com- munity. Pioneers with historical claims were at a distinct advan- tage and were able to benefit when prices soared. A small number of pioneers with larger holdings began employing others not only for seaweed binding but to also work their seaweed farms, while they diversified into higher value activities, typically trading. Most, however, remained focused on expanding their cultivated area, sometimes through purchasing new lokasi. Indeed, our sur- vey found that the livelihoods of 73% of respondents became more specialized after adopting seaweed, with medium to larger farm- ers tending to be more specialized, whereas smaller scale farmers combined a bricolage of livelihood activities. By 2022, seaweed farming had become the main income source for most seaweed farming households in both villages, and it was also providing opportunities for labour within the villages with multiplier effects for local services and shops, increasing incomes more broadly. Labour opportunities in seaweed farm- ing were particularly important for those without access to land or sea space, mainly women working as seaweed binders. Access to these labourers, in turn, contributed to maintaining sea space access amongst larger farmers, who otherwise would not be able to fully utilize their lokasi (i.e., having property without access). Lack of access to these labourers also posed significant risks for farmers as labour needs often occurred suddenly (e.g., after a period of rainfall which typically led to a pathobiotic syndrome known as ‘ice–ice’). This process demonstrates the complemen- tary and constitutive relations between those who control access (lokasi owner) and those who maintain it (labourers), and ‘it is in the relation between these two that the division of benefits is ne- gotiated’ (Ribot and Peluso 2003, 159). However, these two roles are neither exclusive nor permanent; they are temporary social positions that can be held by the same person or shared amongst cooperating or competing individuals, and they solidify around 14710366, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joac.12617 by Moss Landing Marine Labs, Wiley Online Library on [04/03/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License11 of 16 the means of access (Ribot and Peluso 2003). Indeed, as seaweed prices rose through 2022, binding labourers sought to increase the price of their labour and there was talk of farmers having to ingratiate themselves to binders to secure access to their labour. So far, we have emphasized how access to prior ‘capitals’, or strands of power, was a key factor in gaining initial access to sea space. However, it is equally important to recognize the role of social identity and labour and indeed how serendipitous a lot of these outcomes were. During the initial phase of the industry, there was no certainty that seaweed would become profitable, and many pioneers were poor fishermen (some with simple sea trap claims) who were able to gain initial access when capital re- quirements were relatively minimal and access relatively open. In numerical terms, seaweed cultivators in Pitu Sunggu were over- whelmingly from the coastal hamlet, Pungkalawaki, where resi- dents were previously engaged in low- value capture fisheries and farm labour, and they were followed by residents of the riverine hamlet. Far fewer cultivators came from the major landowning hamlet (which did not have direct access to the sea), although those that did tended to be relatively wealthy tambak owners who secured larger sea claims. In this analysis, we have attempted to demonstrate how there are parallels between many of the access mechanisms identified by Ribot and Peluso (2003) and the live- lihood resources (human, physical, natural, social and financial capitals) widely used in the SLF. We now take this forward to ex- amine how institutions regulating access have been partially in- formed by the livelihood practices of village households. 6 | Emergent Institutions: Conflict, Livelihood Practice and Authority The analysis in the previous section demonstrates how access to a livelihood resource (sea space) was initially mediated through a range of structural and relational mechanisms. Over time, institutions (as ‘regularized patterns of behaviour be- tween individuals and groups in society’, Mearns  1995, 103) have continued to evolve through episodes of conflict, man- aged initially within the villages, often involving appeals to village- level authorities. As argued by Leach, Mearns, and Scoones  (1999), making conflicts explicit helps us better un- derstand the complex set of institutional relationships in a particular arena of resource use. In turn, our exploration of dynamic institutions seeks to infuse a more socially differen- tiated perspective into the livelihood framework's ‘analysis of institutional organisational influences on access to livelihood resources’ (Scoones 1998, 4). [Correction added on 14 January 2025, after first online publication: the phrase ‘of institutional’ has been removed in the preceding sentence.] Power and influence over institutions of resource access can arise from diffuse sources, including locally powerful dis- courses and social norms. Peluso  (1992, 1996) demonstrated how access can be shaped by an informal ethic of access, aris- ing within communities to serve social and cultural purposes in addition to economic ones. She emphasized, however, that any such ethic ‘is a moment in a temporal zone of a larger property process’ (Peluso 1996, 515) and should certainly not be equated with any romantic notion of a timeless customary tenure regime or assume the existence of a unified community. In Peluso's West Kalimantan case study, access to the durian fruit harvest was determined by an individual's position within a descent group, mediated by an ethic of access and a desire to maintain social harmony. In coastal Indonesia, we observe the existence of such an ethic in both discourse and as a regularized pattern of behaviour, albeit one embedded within a dynamic constellation of power. When people are not conforming to expected social ethics, others attribute them with ‘greedy’ behaviour (serakah), with this social stigma a strong motivation for ‘sharing lokasi’. As already noted earlier, there was a widespread (but not uni- versal) discourse regarding strong community values within the villages that drove instances of access sharing. There is, further- more, an understanding within the communities that conflict management reflects the leadership capacity of the village or dusun leaders, where failure to resolve conflicts, and maintain harmony, affects their legitimacy and authority. These leaders claim that conflict is rare and always resolved peacefully in a ‘family way’ (secara kekeluargaan). One dusun leader explained, ‘most of us are still family after all, so even if there is a conflict, we resolve it amicably’. In practice, however, this is not always the case. Ensuring ‘peace within the community’ (as one village leader explained) may be the main objective of village govern- ment, which often means maintaining the status quo, but it is also through processes of conflict that new institutions emerge. In the early days of seaweed farming in the 1990s, conflict be- tween seaweed farmers and fishers could escalate to violence. Burhan, a seaweed pioneer in Laikang, described heated conflicts where he and others had to stay up at night and watch over their lokasi to prevent damage by fishers. From the fishers' perspective, seaweed farming was interfering with fishing activities because it blocked access to the sea and could entangle nets, such that sea- weed lines would be deliberately damaged by fishers. Both par- ties insisted that the sea was common property, accessible to all. Despite attempts to resolve the conflicts peacefully, sometimes with mediation by the village government, the conflicts only abated in the late 2000s when many fishers also began cultivat- ing seaweed. Indeed, pukat fishermen (many suffering from re- duced catch volumes due to over- exploitation) were early seaweed adopters and so were responsible themselves for commons en- closure (in a process akin to ‘intimate exclusion’, as described by Li 2014). New institutions arose out of livelihood practice change. Net- based crab fishing, however, remained important in both vil- lages long after seaweed cultivation commenced and net entangle- ment with seaweed lines continued. As most crab fishers (except the poorest ones) began cultivating seaweed, these conflicts also subsided. As seaweed came to dominate livelihoods in the villages, its economic importance (and its higher levels of investment) be- came the basis of conflict resolution. The poorest households, re- liant on the collection of crabs, clams, and rebon, had generally made lower capital investments and became marginalized when in conflict with seaweed farmers. Rusman, a middle- aged crab fisher who lives in a semipermanent house, lamented: ‘What can we do. Seaweed farming does have higher economic investment than crab fishing. It is cheaper to cut crab nets than seaweed lines.’ By the time of our fieldwork, seaweed farmers finding crab nets entangled in their lines would simply cut the nets and dump them at the pier. Nurman (male, mid- 40s seaweed cultivator) explains: ‘No one came to ask for restitution because they know they were in the wrong. They should not be setting up the nets too close to 14710366, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joac.12617 by Moss Landing Marine Labs, Wiley Online Library on [04/03/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License12 of 16 Journal of Agrarian Change, 2024 the seaweed lines.’ As argued by Ribot and Peluso (2003, 158), ac- cess relations are ‘always changing, depending on an individual's or group's position and power within various social relationships’. However, these poor crab netters were not entirely ‘losing out’ as they also benefited from collecting fallen seaweed in their nets, as evident particularly in Pitu Sunggu. Conflicts between fishers and seaweed farmers became less frequent as the number of seaweed farmers grew, but conflict amongst seaweed farmers emerged. A 50- year- old female sea- weed binder told us that not all conflicts were being resolved ‘in a family way’: ‘there are lots of conflicts over lokasi here. Sometimes brothers fight with each other; fathers fight with their sons’. Overlapping claims were the most common conflict and usually happen on uncultivated lokasi or when one party tried to extend their lokasi. In 2012, Ridwan went to work on a shrimp farm in Kalimantan. Before he left, he allowed another farmer (Hamid) to use his location with a verbal agreement that, when he returned, he would take it back. Verbal agreement, usually witnessed by neighbours, is a normal means to transfer lokasi rights, whether it is renting, borrowing, sharecropping or selling (‘talking claims’ according to the schema provided by García and van Dijk 2020). When Ridwan returned in 2018, Hamid's son was cultivating the lokasi. Ridwan confronted Hamid, who asked him to share some of his location with his son. Ridwan reluctantly agreed, ‘I was being kind’ he said resentfully, conforming to social pressure. Competing claims also occur along boundary markers. Ilham explained, ‘some people move their lines [and anchors] little by little until it crosses the boundaries of others' uncultivated lokasi. When the owner of that lokasi complains, they say it's been there all along’. Indeed, there are inherent difficulties in grounding claims at sea. Mediation of overlapping claims by the village government can sometimes be needed and this is based on testimony from neighbours. However, even if there is a con- sensus amongst such testimonies, one- sided rulings are often eschewed in favour of lokasi- sharing outcomes (attempting to maintain harmony). Those with larger holdings subsequently forced to ‘share’ their claim considered their forfeit as a sign of benevolence, whereas the smaller claimant considers the redis- tribution fair based on an ethic of access. Another type of conflict amongst seaweed cultivators is the vi- olation of common space. The community generally acknowl- edges that uncultivated space between locations, and near the pier in Pitu Sunggu, is needed for boatways. However, as sea- weed prices increased in 2021–22, some farmers expanded into these boatways. They were quickly rebuked by others and this social pressure was initially sufficient to ensure compliance. Throughout 2022, however, we observed lokasi were becoming denser and directly adjacent to the pier. Observing a violation of this community norm, one seaweed farmer approached the uncle of the perpetrator and reported to us: ‘I told him that I wouldn't be responsible if his nephew's ropes are damaged in the future because it stands on the boatways. Then, he was angry.’ This resulted in a physical fight the next evening, which re- quired mediation by the Dusun leader, such that eventually the conflicted space remained an open boatway. The enforcement of community ethics has its limits, however, particularly when conflicts involve local elites, and the ability to forcefully assert the claim also requires a degree of bravado. Marginal groups typically avoid conflict and confrontation, such as when their crab nets became entangled with seaweed lines. Often, this was intimately linked with unequal client relationships with elites (seaweed and crab traders, or employers of labour) and a fear of later social exclusion affecting their livelihood. Although claims were thus legitimized through informal norms and discourses, dispute resolution also involved appeals to authority. The village governments in both our sites, despite lacking a clear legal mandate, have been actively involved, sometimes effectively, in resolving conflicts. [Correction added on 14 January 2025, after first online publication: the word ‘and suggests’ has been removed in the preceding sentence.] This has created a fluid relationship between informal institutions and authority. In 2019, the village government in Laikang attempted to further assert authority over sea space by drafting a Village Regulation to formalize (and adjust) the informal rules pertain- ing to access. As suggested by the conflict between Hamid and Ridwan above, uncertainty over the permanence of claims had become a source of conflict. A former member of the village council (responsible for the draft) explained: Once someone invested labour and capital to mark the ‘lokasi’ at sea, it is [considered] forever theirs, whether they use it or not. Some of them left the ‘lokasi’ vacant for years and this creates problems over and over again because other people need to use it. [But] in principle, sea space should be accessible for everyone and therefore we created a ‘compensation’ scheme for the vacant ‘lokasi’ to be used by other people. But we need to regulate it more formally so that similar conflicts do not keep recurring in the future. The draft regulation proposed progressive reforms whereby any lokasi abandoned for three consecutive years would return to the common resource pool such that others have the right to exploit it. This, however, would require consultation with both the vil- lage government and the previous ‘owner’ of the lokasi to pro- duce a win–win solution through a ‘compensation’ mechanism. These proposed rules, challenging the permanence of rights held by lokasi owners, were intensely debated within the community. Those with smaller lokasi generally favoured the new rule as a fairer redistribution of resource access, whereas others (often those with larger or multiple lokasi) claimed it violated existing practices in the community. Most villagers were content to fol- low the will of the leaders who, at the time, were relatively well- educated elites not dependent on seaweed farming. A subsequent change in village leadership, apparently with economic and po- litical interests in maintaining the status quo, however, resulted in a decreased commitment to these reforms, demonstrating the importance of ‘practical political economy’ (Li 1996). This draft village regulation was an attempt to represent claims or de facto rights through a legalization process, putting the bur- den of enforcement on the state (the village authority). As this regulation was not actually based on statutory law and was in fact contrary to the law, but still involving the lowest rung of the state hierarchy, it would have provided what Lund  (2021) referred to as an ‘air of legality’. Although poorly understood within local communities, a legal framework for the use of 14710366, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joac.12617 by Moss Landing Marine Labs, Wiley Online Library on [04/03/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License13 of 16 coastal space does exist in Indonesia. National Law No. 27/2007 on Coastal and Small Islands Management provided a legal basis, mandating regional governments to develop marine and coastal zoning (spatial) plans within the coastal zone in their jurisdictions.3 A 2019 provincial zoning plan4 stipulates that the coastal waters in our study villages be dedicated for fish capture and seaweed farming activities. The 2007 law also introduced a new property right known as the coastal waters commercial use right (or HP- 3), which allows individuals or corporations to utilize sea space (and to transfer their rights to another party). This, however, was subsequently ruled inoper- ative by the Constitutional Court, following concerns it would encourage commoditization of sea space and control by power- ful corporate actors, and the Law was amended in 2014. It still, however, required permits issued by district and provincial gov- ernments (not village administrations) for any use of sea space (with exceptions for recognized customary adat communities). These permits were nontransferrable. No respondent in our vil- lages, however, was aware of any such permit requirements. The Provincial Department of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, meanwhile, knew of the use and commoditization of sea space by local communities and told us that ‘in the future, we are hoping that they will get permits. Currently, we are focusing on large- scale enterprises which mostly conduct activities beyond four miles from the shore’. In 2022, we were told by government authorities that several large- scale companies (including a state- owned enterprise) were interested in seaweed production in South Sulawesi, and two had already been granted a location permit. However, they had not commenced operations because of resistance from local commu- nities demanding a fairer redistribution of the benefits. Agreement with local communities is a requirement of such permits, and the government stipulated that large- scale seaweed farming would only be permitted four miles offshore to avoid competition with small- scale fishers and seaweed farmers. When asked about the prospects of an enhanced management and permitting role for the provincial government, village respondents were hesitant and unsure whether this would result in increased protection of their property rights, backed up by the full authority of the state, or dispossession. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated how greater involvement of the state in resource management has led to reduced access by local community and the transfer of these access rights to powerful external actors (e.g., Hall, Hirsch, and Li 2011; Boelens, Hoogesteger, and Rodriguez de Francisco 2014; Cramb  2016). In practice, access to sea space within our case studies remained controlled by a hybrid arrangement of informal institutions within the communities and the state as a source of authority. This hybrid arrangement was built upon dynamic, often ambiguous, informal rules that are continuously negotiated and reconstituted through episodes of conflict, embedded within so- cial and ethical practices and informed by changing livelihood practices. These institutions were also deeply intersected by un- equal social structures and power relations both within the com- munity and throughout the seaweed value chain. 7 | Conclusion Integration into a global market has created a new commod- ity out of sea space and the emergence of fluid institutional arrangements governing access, as seaweed cultivation came to dominate village economies and local livelihoods in Indonesia. Sea space has become an important livelihood resource (‘nat- ural capital’ in the schema used by Scoones  1998), access to which was influenced by a range of other resources available to individuals (finance or capital, social identity and relationships, know- how, labour, infrastructure, technology and the ability to control discourse around social norms). Its importance, more- over, only emerged following the active creation of a market for seaweed itself by powerful downstream actors. For some sea- weed cultivators, access to finance from local traders was an important mechanism enabling them to benefit from sea space. Access to sea space, particularly within the shallow coastal wa- ters, has continued to be governed by local social institutions, albeit embedded within a broader political economy and the var- ious structural and relational mechanisms outlined above. Local communities devised rules on access and management of sea space, where investment of capital and labour were key elements legitimizing claims (following earlier norms applied to the con- struction of semi- permanent fish traps). The seaweed boom, however, increased the scale of commoditization, as lokasi came to be sold, leased and sharecropped. Sometimes, lokasi were also shared based on an ethic of access. What was once common property has been progressively transformed into individual- ized assets, and the legitimacy of this process has largely gone unchallenged within the communities. There was some initial conflict with crab fishers, but these individuals either took up seaweed farming themselves or were forced to accept its eco- nomic importance to livelihoods in the village. As sea space use intensified, conflicts arose with overlapping boundaries, encroachment on boatways and uncertainty over the permanence of claims. These occurred because of a lack of clarity over the representation of claims and possibly ex- acerbated by the lack of a legal framework of property rights. Institutions and social norms emerged endogenously from within the communities to resolve these conflicts, with an ethic of lokasi- sharing being partially effective in maintaining a de- gree of social harmony. Individuals, however, soon turned to the strongest authority in the community—the village adminis- tration consisting of village and dusun leaders and representing the lowest rung of the Indonesian state. This suggests a tenta- tive move in our case studies to turn claims into rights, with the burden of enforcement shifting from claimants to the state. Instead of enforcing higher level laws, the village administra- tions attempted to ‘legalize’ informal institutions and to intro- duce a redistributive reform. Even in a context where the legal framework is fragmented (indeed currently inoperable), and the state has limited capacity to effectively enforce rights, individ- uals still attempted to legalize their claims by invoking state authority and producing ‘legal’ documents (village regulations). In this case, the intersection between formal and informal insti- tutions is complementary in the sense that the ‘rules in use’ are rooted in social norms and practices, and these were being legit- imized by the authority of the village administration. The ‘air of legality’ (Lund 2023), referring in our case to the recognition of claims by the village administration, and its role in conflict res- olution, is particularly important in this context. Resource com- petition and conflict in these cases seemed to inexorably invite state involvement, albeit contained (so far) within the village 14710366, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joac.12617 by Moss Landing Marine Labs, Wiley Online Library on [04/03/2025].

We found that invoking this level of state authority did not necessarily reduce the legitimacy of informal institutions, as these were generally reinforced by the village administration. The involvement of higher levels of the state (District or Provincial level), potentially through a permitting system or enforcement of spatial plans and zoning regulations, may ultimately be neces- sary, but it has the potential to result in a more disruptive influ- ence on current access arrangements and subsequently livelihood outcomes. Current arrangements, it should be highlighted, have not guaranteed fair and equitable resource distribution as both formal and informal institutions are infused by the structural and relational mechanisms highlighted in Section 5. As a result, earlier claimants over sea space have benefitted disproportion- ately and have thus been in a better position to subsequently shape emergent institutions regulating access for themselves and others. Those without seaweed claims, but dependent on net or trap- based capture fisheries (such as crab fishers and rebon shrimp collectors) for their livelihood, were losing out from these institutions, although some of them also benefitted through paid work or the collection of fallen seaweed. There was, however, some evidence that informal institutions, when embodying an ethic of access, for example, have moderated the potential harm- ful livelihood impacts of resource commoditization. It has en- abled a degree of resource- sharing and has limited the excessive accumulation of sea space by a few wealthy households, while so far preventing the involvement by large- scale corporations. A key contribution we have sought to make in this paper has been to demonstrate how access to sea space and the emergence of institutions regulating it have been strongly influenced by broader structural mechanisms as well as local social norms and the agency of coastal households themselves. Households and individuals have responded to changing livelihood opportuni- ties over time, and their day- to- day practices, infused to be sure by unevenly distributed access to livelihood resources, have been critical to these institutional outcomes. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the compatibility of the SLF framework with a theory of access, whereby the latter generates sharper insights into the political economy of rural livelihoods.

Endnotes 1 Commoditization refers to a process where production and so- cial relations increasingly become governed by market principles, transforming goods, labour and the means of production into com- modities that are bought and sold. Rooted in a neo- Marxist critique of capitalism, commoditization represents a shift from subsistence- based production to dependency on market relations, often resulting in re- duced control for local producers and an erosion of traditional social structures (Vandergeest 1988). 2 The amount of this village fund, as mandated by this law, could be less or more than the oft- quoted one billion IDR depending on the popula- tion size, administrative area, poverty rate and geographical difficulty (Government Regulation No.60/2014). The amounts for Laikang (in 2021) includes a cash transfer of 1.68 billion IDR from the national government and 900 million IDR from the city/regency government. The village head leader in Pitu Sunggu declined to share this informa- tion with us. 3 Regional Government Law No.23/2014 subsequently enhanced the authority of provincial governments (instead of district governments) to manage sea space for areas 0–12 miles offshore, and the provincial Department of Fisheries and Marine Affairs established branch offices in each coastal district. When the lead author visited the Pangkep branch, it was a small office at the harbour with limited resources. 4 Initially dedicated for coastal areas and small islands, named Rencana Zonasi Wilayah Pesisir dan Pulau- Pulau Kecil (RZWP3K), the zon- ing is now integrated within the regional spatial plans (Rencana Tata Ruang Wilayah or RTRW), encompassing both land and water.
