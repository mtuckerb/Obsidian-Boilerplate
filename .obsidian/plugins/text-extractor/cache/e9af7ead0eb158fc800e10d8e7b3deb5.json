One aspect that may shed light on how the field engages the construct of social justice is through understanding more about recognition of privilege. This study examines how demographic differences, psychosocial predictors, and social work program variables may be related to increased levels of heterosexual and cisgender privilege awareness among social work students. In the heterosexual privilege model (N = 585), increased privilege awareness was associated with identifying as a cisgender woman, a more liberal political orientation, com- pleting a course on power, privilege, and oppression, a critical endorsement of social justice, and being a 2-year MSW or doc- toral student. In the cisgender privilege model (N = 758), pre- dictors of increased privilege awareness included identifying as a cisgender woman, identifying as gay, a more liberal political orientation, completing a course on power, privilege, and oppression, a critical endorsement of social justice, and being a 2-year MSW or doctoral student. The findings demonstrate the importance of understanding social justice from a critical per- spective and for educators to effectively communicate the con- nections between social justice and social work practice. Effective strategies to do this are discussed. KEYWORDS critical social justice orientation; cisgender privilege; heterosexual privilege Social injustice is insidious, pervasive, and harmful to individuals and communities (Popay et al., 2010). Further, the recent political context of increased hate crimes, overtly hateful demonstrations (e.g., Charlottesville, NC; University of Florida), the normalization of oppres- sive rhetoric (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2018), support for removal of protective policies for LGBTQ+ people (American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU], 2021), and the increase in anti-transgender related policies (Ronan, 2021) underscore the need for the social work profes- sion and educational system to examine how the field is preparing students to operationalize the connection between social work practice CONTACT Brittanie Atteberry-Ash Brittanie.ash@colostate.edu School of Social Work, Colorado State University, 450 W Pitkin St, Fort Collins, CO, 80521, USA JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN SOCIAL WORK 2023, VOL. 43, NO. 4, 449–474 https://doi.org/10.1080/08841233.2023.2246155 © 2023 Taylor & Francis and social justice. A clear, concrete, and explicit connection grounding practice in the concept of social justice is needed to effectively fight these all too common injustices (Hayes et al., 2016). While social justice is commonly understood in everyday vernacular as the promotion of social equality through the reduction of barriers to services and goods, scholars have concluded that within the social work discipline, multiple definitions of social justice exist and that, as a concept, it is not well under- stood or clearly articulated (Atteberry-Ash, 2023). Even as the profession has yet to come to a consensus on its meaning (Finn, 2016), the term has become increasingly popular in that it is used in everyday conversations, in schools’ mission statements, and by government and community leaders, often without a concrete delineation of what the user actually means. A recent conceptual review of the construct of social justice within the social work literature suggests that, although several differing definitions do cur- rently exist, the discipline could be better served through a definition that is broadened to explicitly include the acknowledgment of (a) historical and current inequities, (b) role of advocacy, (c) recognition of personal agency, and (d) integration of access to rights and opportunities (Atteberry-Ash, 2023). These additional components are themes that not only exist in the discipline’s body of scholarship about work toward increased equity but are also central to the profession's Code of Ethics from a critical theory lens. The 2022 Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) introduce a new competency (Competency 3: Engage Anti-racism, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Practice) which states that social work students must understand social injustices, including comprehending the mechanisms that perpetuate those injustices (Council on Social Work Education [CSWE], 2022). This is a shift from the 2015 EPAS which neither included an explicit requirement of an examination of the processes of marginalization nor the processes of privileging dominant populations. This is an important distinction in the EPAS since multicultural and anti-oppression scholars have argued that content on diversity and traditionally marginalized populations is not the same as preparing social workers to address structural inequality (Atteberry-Ash et al., 2019; Longres & Scanlon, 2001; Razack, 2002). Failure to explicitly address power, privilege, and oppression may, in fact, reinforce stratification (Miller et al., 2004), while educating about privilege is paramount in attenuating the negative out- comes experienced by marginalized communities (Swenson, 1998; Walls et al., 2009). Unfortunately, many courses that focus on oppressed popu- lations fail to mention or examine corresponding issues of privilege (Case, 2013b; Ferber et al., 2007), and without making the connection explicit in course content, students may leave programs unaware of the existence of privilege and its role in maintaining inequity (Case, 2013a; 450 B. ATTEBERRY-ASH ET AL. Case et al., 2012; McIntosh, 2012). Underscoring this gap, clinicians have noted feeling unprepared to address issues of power in work with clients since neither training nor supervision typically deals with privilege and its impact on interventions (Hays et al., 2007). With the addition of this competency, programs can now ensure the inclusion of content about privilege to new and existing social work courses that address prejudice, discrimination, and inequities, representing an opportunity to provide a fuller and more well-rounded view of systems of oppression (Case, 2013a; CSWE, 2022). The importance of privilege Privilege – the system of unearned advantages enjoyed by members of dominant social groups, based solely on membership in those groups (McIntosh, 1993) – “gives some people the freedom to be thoughtless at best, and murderous at worst” (Bailey, 2003, p. 308). Helping social work students to see the “embedded forms that members of the dominant group are taught not to see” (McIntosh, 1993, p. 37) can lead to transformation that changes the way future social work practitioners can address systems of oppression (Allen, 1995), helping them to explicitly connect their personal privileged identities with broader contextual and structural issues (Parker, 2003). Social work education has not, however, historically done an adequate job of addressing issues of power – including that which is embedded in privilege – either in the curriculum or in practice (Almeida et al., 2008; Etiony, 2007), leaving future practitioners often confused on how to address these concerns with clients (Miller et al., 2004). Increased awareness and knowledge about privilege not only leads to greater awareness of inequality and improved attitudes of dominant mem- bers toward oppressed groups (Becker et al., 2014; Blumenfeld & Jaekel, 2012; Case, 2007; Ellison et al., 2019; Stewart et al., 2012), but also to greater social justice action (Ancis & Szymanski, 2001; Goodman, 2011; Lawrence & Bunche, 1996; Lewis et al., 2012; Stewart et al., 2012). Awareness of privilege can lead to privilege investment – that of using one’s privilege to work against the oppression of others (Perrin et al., 2014). The relationship between witnessing discrimination and willingness to engage in collective action for justice, for example, appears to be driven primarily through the pathway of greater awareness of privilege (see Ulug & Tropp, 2020 on racial privilege). Some recent findings suggest that the relationship between privilege awareness and social justice may, however, vary depending on the type of privilege awareness (Garrett-Walker et al., 2018), and while many mental health clinicians have some awareness of the existence and impact of privilege, fewer recognize the impact of privilege on the ther- apeutic alliance and therapeutic outcomes (see Whitman & Han, 2016 on cisgender privilege). JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN SOCIAL WORK 451 Predictors of privilege awareness While research on privilege awareness is fairly recent to the existing body of scholarship, what research does exist finds some differences in the level of awareness of privilege based on different social identities. In this section, we take a look at gender, age, religion, political orientation, and contact with minoritized people as predictors of privilege awareness. Gender, which existing research on privilege has most frequently (and problematically) conceptualized in a binary male/female model, appears to play a role in how aware someone is of the privileges they embody. White women, for example, are significantly more likely than White men to report a willingness to confront White privilege and to have higher levels of White privilege remorse (Ellison et al., 2019; Todd et al., 2015). Factors such as masculinity, economic pressures, and a sense of independence may act as barriers for White men to acknowledge White privilege (Scott & Robinson, 2001). Cabrera (2014) suggests that living at this intersection of White race and male gender may result in hyper-privilege, making it difficult for White men to acknowledge the role that advantages due to privilege have in shaping access to resources and improved life chances. Similarly, due to the in-group advantage men have because of their gender, some men simply are likely to deny the existence of male privilege (Case, 2007). Predictors of privilege awareness based on age or perceived age are not examined in the existing literature. Additionally, privilege based on age can vary among cultures wherein some view older adults as assets who often are consulted for counsel, support, or advice (Black & Stone, 2005), while in other cultures they are devalued. While older adults may experience some degree of privilege (either culturally or due to other privileged identities), they can also experience oppression based on ageism, their physical health, mental health status, and/or loss of independence (Black & Stone, 2005). Religious variables – including affiliation, importance, and religiosity – have been examined primarily in exploring prejudice and disadvantage experienced by minoritized populations rather than having a focus on advantages experi- enced by dominant populations (Tranby & Hartmann, 2008). In that arena, there is consistent evidence that those who are religiously affiliated tend to have more negative attitudes toward outgroup members compared with those who are not religiously affiliated (Shariff et al., 2016) and that higher levels of religiosity are associated with more prejudicial attitudes (Johnson et al., 2012). This includes prejudice toward LGB persons (Anderson & Koc, 2015; Whitehead, 2014) as well as transgender people (Campbell et al., 2019). The scholarship that does exist on religion and attitudes toward dominant populations similarly finds religious affiliation (Davis & Smith, 2008; Verkuyten, 2007) and religiosity (Dunkel & Dutton, 2016; Johnson et al., 2012) to predict more favoritism for one’s in-group, 452 B. ATTEBERRY-ASH ET AL. a central aspect of the manifestation of privilege. White conservative Protestants, for example, are less likely to be aware of White privilege (Tranby & Hartmann, 2008) and are much more likely to report experi- encing “reverse racism” – claims that effectively ignore systemic advan- tages for White people – than other religious groups (Mayrl & Saperstein, 2013). On the other hand, sanctification of social justice – religious/spiritual significance of working for social justice and struc- tural change (Todd et al., 2014) – a feature of more liberal religious traditions (Todd et al., 2015), is associated with increased White privi- lege awareness, behavioral intention to address White privilege, and with White privilege remorse (Todd et al., 2015). These differences in part may be due to the tendency of religious conservatives to explain inequality in terms of individual-level factors (e.g., morality, work ethic, parenting practices) rather than systemic explanations (e.g., historical patterns, discriminatory practices, differential access) (Emerson & Smith, 2000), while religious liberals are more likely embrace systemic explana- tions of inequities (Todd, 2011). Individuals who report being more politically conservative tend to score high on measures of right-wing authoritarianism (Altemeyer, 1988) and social dominance orientation (Pratto et al., 1994) both of which promote commit- ment to existing privilege structures among historically powerful groups (Whitley, 1999). Similarly, research has found that Republican party identifi- cation is associated with a lack of understanding of White privilege (Hartmann et al., 2009). Many contemporary conservatives go further and deride the idea of White privilege as an example of political correctness (see, for example, Adams, 2016; Schwartz, 2016). Recent findings, however, suggest that political orientation’s relationship to privilege awareness may vary depending upon generational cohort (Egan Brad et al., 2019). The contact hypothesis (Allport, 1954) argues that intergroup contact – under the right conditions (e.g., equal status and common goals) – can reduce prejudicial attitudes and behaviors. While research findings have supported the central premise of the idea with various minoritized groups (African Americans: Brown et al., 2003; LGB individuals: Smith et al., 2009; Muslims: Novotny & Polonsky, 2011; Savelkous et al., 2011), others have challenged the idea arguing for different underlying mechan- isms (Bertrand & Duflo, 2017) and even positing the idea that contact can increase prejudicial attitudes (Paolini et al., 2010). Further, little extant research has examined the relationship between intergroup con- tact and privilege awareness (for an exception, see Nordstrom, 2015), but scholars have argued that social interaction and friendships can raise awareness of the importance of challenging one’s own privilege as a means to addressing oppressive grievances (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2014; Jones & Brewster, 2017). JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN SOCIAL WORK 453 Heterosexual and cisgender privilege While there has been increased attention in the scholarly literature to issues of privilege (Manglitz, 2003), the majority of research over the last couple of decades has focused primarily on White (Pewewardy, 2007; Rodriguez, 2000) and male (Coston & Kimmel, 2012; Farough, 2003) privilege, with lesser attention paid to heterosexual (Blumer et al., 2013; Montgomery & Stewart, 2012), Christian (Blumenfeld, 2006; Blumenfeld & Jaekel, 2012) and social class (Kivel, 2004; Williams & Melchiori, 2013) privilege. Other types of privilege – such as cisgender, settler, and able-bodied privileges – have rarely been examined in depth (Case et al., 2014; Israel, 2012). In terms of heterosexual privilege awareness, while most heterosexuals understand that LGBQ individuals experience oppression, they frequently do not understand the advantages they experience due to their non-minoritized sexual orientation (Simoni & Walters, 2001). However, some pedagogical approaches have been found to be effective in increasing heterosexual privilege awareness (see, for example, Case & Stewart, 2010; Case et al., 2014; Nunn & Bolt, 2015; Walls et al., 2009). An understanding of one’s heterosexual privi- lege has been found to be one source of motivation for engagement in LGBQ- supportive behavior (Mohr, 2002; Russell, 2011) and in the development of an LGBQ ally identity development (Duhigg et al., 2010). In one study that examined LGBQ activism, women scored higher on heterosexual privilege awareness than did men, and while heterosexual privilege awareness was associated in the sample with LGBQ activism for women, it was not for men (Montgomery & Stewart, 2012). Even less is known about cisgender privilege awareness than about heterosexual privilege awareness, although at least one study has found an increase in cisgender privilege awareness through participating in participatory action research on the inclusion of transgender students (Case et al., 2012). Schope and Eliason (2000) argue that internalized beliefs from dominant cisgender discourses can influence how mental health clinicians view and evaluate LGBT clients, and Saltzburg (2015) suggests that unlike many cultural groups, social work practice with LGBT people is influenced by the “socially constructed, moral order of traditional religious culture,” (p. 206) making educating about transgender and nonbinary people (as well as LGBQ people) particularly challenging. These hegemonic and privileged narratives can become unknowingly integrated into social workers’ professional knowledges, making education about cisgender privilege essential for social work practitioners (Knochel et al., 2017). Research questions To add in the understanding of privilege among social work students, this study examined three research questions about the correlates of heterosexual 454 B. ATTEBERRY-ASH ET AL. privilege awareness among social work students in the U.S., and the same three questions regarding cisgender privilege awareness. First, what demographic differences (i.e., gender, race, disability status, and age) are correlated with increased levels of heterosexual/cisgender privilege awareness? Second, what psychosocial predictors (i.e., political orientation, having LGBQ/transgender friends, religious affiliation, religious importance, and religious attendance) are correlated with increased levels of heterosexual/cisgender privilege aware- ness? Third, what social work program variables (i.e., programmatic focus [macro/micro/both], degree level [BSW/MSW-advanced standing/MSW-2 year/doctoral], having taken a course on power, privilege and oppression, personal endorsement of a critical social justice orientation, having had an intergroup dialogue experience, programmatic endorsement of a critical social justice orientation) are correlated with increased levels of heterosexual/cisgen- der privilege awareness? Methods Measures Dependent variables To capture the dependent variables of heterosexual privilege and cisgender privilege, two scales were adapted from The White Privilege Scale (Swim & Miller, 1999), to independently measure heterosexual and cisgender privilege on a five-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). The scales each consist of five items that measured recognition of privilege (my status as a heterosexual/cisgender person grants me unearned privileges in today’s society), acknowledgment of advantages (I feel that being heterosexual/cisgen- der person in the United States opens many doors for heterosexuals/cisgender people during their everyday lives), and the assets that both cisgender and heterosexual identity provide (my sexual orientation/gender identity is an asset to me in my everyday life). Factor analysis and examination of the scree plot indicates that all of the items of the heterosexual privilege-scale load onto one factor. The scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86 in the heterosexual subsample. Using the same process, a one-factor solution was found to be the best fit for the cisgender privilege scale which had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.88 in the cisgender subsample. Independent variables Several demographic variables were examined in the models. Age was cap- tured in an open-ended manner, by asking: What is your age? Gender identity was gathered with the question: What is your gender? with a response set of woman, female, trans woman, transfeminine; man, male, trans man, transmas- culine; nonbinary, genderqueer, gender fluid; agender; another gender not listed. JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN SOCIAL WORK 455 Students were given the ability to select multiple answers, however no students selected multiple genders, and therefore no recoding was needed. Because of the size of some of the response sets, the variable was recoded to include three categories: 1) woman, female, trans woman, transfeminine; 2) man, male, trans man, transmasculine; and 3) nonbinary, genderqueer, genderfluid, agen- der. A question inquiring if students were transgender, nonbinary, or gender- queer was included and asked: Are you transgender, nonbinary, or genderqueer (for this study “transgender” includes anyone whose current gender is different than the one assigned at birth), response options were yes, no, unsure, and decline to answer. For this question, no one who selected unsure was included in the final analytic sample, therefore it became a dichotomous (yes, no) response set for purposes of analyses. Sexual orientation was obtained by asking the question: What is your sexual orientation? Response options included lesbian, gay, queer, bisexual, pansex- ual, asexual, heterosexual, other – fill in the blank. Respondents could provide multiple responses. Due to small numbers of certain responses, the response set was recoded to gay, lesbian, bisexual/pansexual, queer, heterosexual, and asexual/other, with bisexual and pansexual becoming a combined variable, and asexual being combined with other. (Examination of the combined categories indicate no significant differences in the relationship with the cisgender privilege scale.) Students’ race/ethnicity was collected, and response options included Black/African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American/ Alaska Native/Indigenous, Latino/a/x, White/Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Multiracial, and Other – fill in the blank. Respondents could provide multiple responses. Due to sizes of certain responses, the several responses were recoded to include the following: Black/African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Latino/a/x, White/Caucasian, multiracial (for students who selected multiple options), and Other (Native American/Alaska Native/Indigenous, Middle Eastern, Other). Social context data collected included political ideology, which was gathered with the question: In general, how do you characterize your political views? Response options were on a scale of 1 through 7 (1 = extremely conservative, 7 = extremely liberal). Two questions inquiring about social contact were asked: Thinking about your social/friend network or family members, how many lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer people do you know? and Thinking about your social/friend network or family members, how many transgender, genderfluid, genderqueer, nonbinary, or agender people do you know? Both questions had the following response options: none, 1, 2 to 4, 5 or more. Information on religious affiliation and religiosity, both the frequency of attending religious services (1 = never, 6 = more than once a week) and the importance of religion in one’s life (1 = not important at all, 4 = very impor- tant), were examined in the study. Responses of religious affiliation included 21 response options based on options from the 2019 Cooperative Institutional 456 B. ATTEBERRY-ASH ET AL. Research Program (CIRP) Freshman Survey (see Stolzenberg et al., 2019). Religious affiliation responses were recategorized according to a modified version of Steensland et al. (2000) religious tradition schema to include six traditions based on analyses with the dependent variables and sample size of each religious tradition: unaffiliated, Catholic, other religious beliefs, Evangelical Christian, Mainline Christian, and Jewish. The Critical Orientation to Social Justice Scale (COSJS) relies on the updated definition from the conceptual review of the definition of social justice in the social work literature (Atteberry-Ash, 2023). From the dimen- sions identified in the review, a scale was created, relying on 12 statements which examine the three major parts of the updated definition (access to rights, acknowledging current and historical inequities, and the various roles of advocacy as it relates to social justice) and was measured on a 5-point Likert scale (from not necessary at all [1] to always necessary [5]), asking students to what degree the following concepts are necessary to their personal definition of social justice. For access to rights, an example statement is: Everyone having the same rights (for example: civil rights); for acknowledging current and historical inequities and example statement is: Acknowledging that historical inequalities exist; and an example statement for the role of advocacy as it relates to social justice is: Advocating to end institutional inequities. In the current sample, the COSJS (personal) scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.92, indicating strong internal consistency. Additionally, respondents were asked to indicate whether those same aspects of social justice were incorporated into their coursework in their current social work program with a 5-point Likert scale from [1] never incorporated to [5] always incorporated. The COSJS (programmatic) scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.94. Procedure Data for this study came from a 2019–2020 national sample of social work students throughout the United States. First, an e-mail was sent to chairs/ directors/deans of 522 schools of social work asking for their program’s participation in the study by forwarding the survey to their student body via student listservs or e-mails. Next, a follow-up e-mail was sent 2 weeks later to all schools who had not yet participated (n = 485), with an additional reminder sent to 458 schools 2 weeks after the second reminder. Overall, 76 schools of social work had students who activated the survey. (The current study received an exemption from the first author’s home institution.) Missing data After removing respondents that answered no questions, a few questions, or only the first portion of the online survey, the sample size for the study was 957. We examined missing data for the variables of interest in the survey. The JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN SOCIAL WORK 457 percentage of missing data on these variables ranged from a low value of 0.63% (n = 6, for gender identity) to a high value of 7.94% (n = 76, for age). Given that all variables had less than 10% missing, we used listwise deletion in line with recommendations on missingness (Bennett, 2001). Next, we examined the amount of missingness on the scales central to the study’s research questions. In this case, mean composite scores were calculated with a 75% cut- point for each of the scale variables. That is, students had to have completed at least 75% of the items on a composite scale to receive a scale score (Bono et al., 2007; Downey & King, 1998; Gottschall et al., 2012). This process removed 158 additional cases bringing the final analytic sample to 790. Scale scores were calculated by adding up the individual items answered and dividing by the number of scale items answered. Analytic approach Following the examination of missingness, bivariate, and multivariate statis- tical analyses were run. All analyses were conducted using Stata 15. Descriptive statistics were generated for all variables (see Table 1). Separate multivariate analyses were then performed to individually examine correlates of hetero- sexual and cisgender privilege. Results Descriptive statistics The full analytic sample consists of 790 respondents who were students enrolled in social work programs in the United States. Descriptive statistics are reported on the full sample (found in Table 1), while inferential statistics reported represent sub- samples that experience the type of privilege examined in the regression models. For example, for models predicting heterosexual privilege awareness, LGBQ-identified respondents are excluded as they do not experience heterosexual privilege and were therefore not asked questions about heterosexual privilege in the original survey. Similarly, for the models predicting cisgender awareness, transgender, and nonbin- ary respondents are excluded as they do not experience cisgender privilege. The sample consists of respondents aged 18 to 72, with a mean age of 27.5 years (SD = 8.4). In terms of gender, 88.6% (n = 700) are female, 8.9% (n = 70) are male, and 2.5% (n = 20) are transgender/nonbinary. Racially, 74.6% (n = 589) are White, 7.6% (n = 60) are Latinx, 8.2% (n = 65) are African American/Black, 5.1% (n = 40) are bi/multiracial, 3.2% (n = 25) are Asian American, and the remainder are Native American/Alaskan Native (1.0%, n = 8) and Middle Eastern (0.4%, n = 3). In terms of sexual orientation, 73.9% (n = 584) are heterosexual, 18.6% (n = 147) are bisexual/pansexual, 3.8% (n = 30) are lesbian, 1.8% (n = 14) are gay, and the remainder are asexual (1.1%, n = 9) or some other sexual orientation (0.8%, n = 6). Of the respon- dents, 16.0% (n = 126) reported having a disability. 458 B. ATTEBERRY-ASH ET AL. Table 1. Sample characteristics (N = 790).

Secularly identified respondents (i.e., agnostic, atheist, and no affiliation) were next with 40.3% (n = 318), followed by other faith traditions (i.e., Buddhist, Islamic, pagan, and other Eastern faith traditions) at 12.0% (n = 95) and Jewish at 3.3% (n = 26). In terms of importance of religion, the mean of 2.5 falls between somewhat important and not too important. The vast majority of respondents indicated that they rarely or never attend reli- gious services at 70.4% (n = 556), with the remainder indicating that they attend monthly or more frequently. Politically, most students identified on the liberal end of the spectrum (74.5%, n = 591), with 17.7% (n = 140) identifying as middle of the road or apolitical, and the remainder (7.5%, n = 59) on the conservative end of the spectrum. The vast majority reported having at least 1 or more people in their social network who is LGBQ (99.4%, n = 785), with most (75.1%, n = 593) reporting have 5 or more LGBQ people in their networks. Fewer, but still a majority (81.9%, n = 647) reported having at least 1 or more TNB (trans- gender or nonbinary) people in their social network, with the largest group (38.2%, n = 302) reporting have 2 to 4 TNB people in their network. Turning our attention to social work educational variables, slightly more than a third (35.6%, n = 281) were in BSW programs, 17.5% (n = 138) were advanced standing MSW students, 44.8% (n = 354) were in 2-year MSW programs, and 2.2% (n = 17) were in either PhD or DSW programs. In terms of practice focus 56.8% (n = 449) reported having a micro-level focus, with 23.3% (n = 184) a macro-level focus, and the remainder at 19.9% (n = 157) reporting a mixed micro-macro focus. Most respondents at 93.4% (n = 738) had taken a course on power, privilege, and oppression. The Critical Social Table 1. (Continued).

ATTEBERRY-ASH ET AL. Justice Orientation scale had a range from 2.1 to 5 with a mean of 4.7 (SD = 0.48) suggesting that many respondents identified most of the characteristics included in the survey as always necessary in their personal definition of social justice. In fact, the largest group (42.7%, n = 337) reported all of the character- istics as always necessary. In terms of whether their perception of their social program endorsing the characteristics of critical social justice, the range was slightly lower, ranging from 1.2 to 5, with a mean 4.3 (SD = 0.76). In terms of dependent variables (both of which had a range of 1 to 5) with higher scores indicating greater awareness of the specific type of privilege. On the hetero- sexual privilege awareness scale, the mean was 4.2 (SD = 0.77) suggesting agreement with the statements acknowledging heterosexual privilege. For cisgender privilege awareness, we found a similar pattern with a mean of 4.3 (SD = 0.84). Inferential statistics Heterosexual privilege Three OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression models were run to examine correlates of heterosexual privilege awareness. For all three models, the sample included only heterosexually identified respondents for a total sample size of 585. The first model is a demographics – only one that includes only gender and race. Neither disability status nor age were significant in any models tested and were therefore not maintained. The second model adds psychosocial variables that are frequently found to be predictors of attitudes toward minor- itized groups and includes the importance of religion, political orientation, and the number of LGBQ friends. Religious affiliation and religious atten- dance were all tested in this second block of variables and were not found to be significant in any models tested and were therefore excluded from final models. The final model adds social work educational variables, including programmatic level (BSW, MSW-advanced standing, MSW-2 year, doctoral), having taken a course on power, privilege, and oppression, and the personal endorsement of a critical social justice orientation. Variables capturing inter- group dialogue experience, programmatic focus (micro, macro, or both) and whether the social work program attended incorporated a critical social justice orientation were not maintained in any models as they were not found to be significant correlates of either type of privilege examined. In the demographics-only model (Table 2, Model 1), cisgender female students scored 0.29 points higher (on a 5-point scale) on heterosexual privilege awareness than cisgender male students (p < .05), while transgender and nonbinary students were not significantly different than cisgender male students. In terms of racial differences, African American respondents scored 0.66 points lower than White students (p < .001), while no other racial groups were significantly different. This model explains almost 7% of the variability in heterosexual privilege scores. JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN SOCIAL WORK 461 In the model adding psychosocial variables (Table 2, Model 2), each 1-point increase in the importance of religion variable (on a 4-point scale ranging from very important (1) to not at all important (4)) is associated with a 0.08 increase in awareness of heterosexual privilege. This suggests that those who note that religion is not at all important on average score, 0.26 points higher on hetero- sexual privilege awareness than those who indicate that religion is very impor- tant. Political orientation (on a 7-point scale ranging from very conservative (1) to very liberal (7)) is associated with a 0.20 increase in heterosexual privilege awareness. As such, controlling for all other variables in the model, the average respondent who is very liberal politically scores almost 1 point higher (on a 5-point scale) on heterosexual privilege awareness than the average respondent who is very conservative. Increases in the number of LGBQ people in one’s social network is not associated with significant differ- ences. Both the gender and racial differences maintained significance with the addition of the psychosocial variables. This model explains slightly more than 23% of the variability in heterosexual privilege scores. In the third model, which adds social work educational variables (Table 2, Model 3), we find doctoral social work students scored 0.47 points higher (p = .05) and 2-year MSW students scored 0.18 points higher (p < 01) on heterosexual privilege awareness than BSW students, while advanced standing MSW students were not significantly different than BSW students. Those who had completed a course on power, privi- lege, and oppression scored 0.36 points higher (p < .001) on heterosexual privilege awareness than those who had not had such a course.

This suggests that students with the highest endorsement of critical aspects in their personal defini- tion of social justice scored 1.03 points higher than students with the lowest endorsement of critical aspects in their personal social justice definition. Significant findings on gender, race, and political orientation from the previous two models maintain their level of significance in the final model, while religious importance loses its statistical significance. This model predicts slightly more than 32% of the variability in hetero- sexual privilege awareness scores. Cisgender privilege Three OLS regression models were run to examine correlates of cisgender privilege awareness. For all three models, the sample included only respondents who did not identify as transgender or nonbinary for a total sample size of 758. The three models included the same variables that were examined in those predicting heterosexual privilege awareness, with the addition of sexual orientation in the current models, and the loss of the transgender/nonbinary identity category on the gender identity variable as no transgender/nonbinary respondents are included in the models predicting cisgender privilege awareness. In the demographics-only model (Table 3, Model 1), cisgender female students scored 0.29 points higher (on a 5-point scale) on cisgender privilege awareness than cisgender male students (p < .05). Students who identified as gay scored 0.83 points higher (p < .001) and those who identified as bisexual/pansexual scored 0.22 points higher (p < .01) than those identified as heterosexuals. Lesbian and asexual/students with another sexual orientation were not significantly different than heterosex- ual students. In terms of racial differences, African American respondents scored 0.71 points lower (p < .001) and those who were Latinx scored 0.23 points lower (p < .05) than White students on cisgender privilege aware- ness. No other racial differences emerged. This model explains slightly more than 9% of the variability in cisgender privilege scores. In the model adding psychosocial variables (Table 3, Model 2), each 1-point increase in political orientation (on a 7-point scale ranging from very con- servative (1) to very liberal (7)) is associated with a 0.21 increased in cisgender privilege awareness. As such, controlling for all other variables in the model, the average respondent (who is very liberal politically) scored slightly more than one-half of a point higher (on a 5-point scale) than the average respon- dent (who is very conservative) on cisgender privilege awareness. Every categorical increase in the number of TNB people in one’s social network JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN SOCIAL WORK 463 (from 0 to 1 to 2–4 to 5 or more) is associated with a 0.07 increase (p < .05) in cisgender privilege awareness. On average, those respondents with 5 or more TNB people in their social network scored approximately 0.25 points higher on cisgender privilege awareness than those who reported having no TNB people in their social network. The gender, sexual orientation, and racial differences found in the previous model maintained significance with the addition of the psychosocial variables. This model explains slightly more than 22% of the variability in cisgender privilege awareness scores. In the third model, which adds social work educational variables (Table 3, Model 3), compared to BSW students, 2-year MSW students scored 0.26 points higher (p < .01) and doctoral social work students scored 0.57 points higher (p < .01) on cisgender privilege awareness while advanced standing MSW students were not significantly different than BSW students. Respondents who had taken a course on power, privilege, and oppression were 0.24 points higher (p < 05) on cisgender privilege awareness than those who had not. For every 1-point increase in score on the personal Critical Social Justice Orientation scale, we found a 0.35 increase in cisgender privilege awareness. This suggests that students with the highest endorsement of critical aspects in their personal definition of social justice score more than one-half point higher than students with the lowest endorsement of critical aspects in their personal social justice definition. All significant differences from previous models maintained their significance with the exception of having transgender/nonbinary people in one’s Table 3.

This loss of significance suggests that some aspect captured in the social work educational variables are undergirding the differences found in the previous model. This final model explains almost 29% of the variability in cisgender privilege awareness scores. Discussion Overall, social work students in this study largely acknowledged both heterosexual and cisgender privilege. The high rates of acknowledgment of both privileges may be a result of the integration of social justice content on LGBTQ+ issues in programs, a product of the types of students social work programs attract (i.e., an awareness of social justice issues prior to entering the program), or some combination of the two. Similar to previous research, however, differences in awareness of privilege differed by several contextual factors. Demographic and psychosocial variables For the most part, demographic and psychosocial variables functioned in a manner consistent with prior research on awareness of privilege with gender and political orientation emerging as the most consistent predictors across models. We found mixed results regarding racial differences in heterosexual and privilege awareness. Given both the mixed results found in existing litera- ture, our current results, and the smaller sample sizes of racial subsamples and the collapsed categories in our models, the relationship between racialization and privilege awareness warrants additional research. We also found mixed support of the contact hypothesis (i.e., number of friends in one’s social network) with some evidence suggesting having trans- gender/nonbinary people in one’s network is correlated with increased cis- gender privilege awareness, while having LGBQ people in one’s network was not correlated with increased awareness of heterosexual privilege awareness. This difference in findings may be a result of the limited variability across our sample with the vast majority of respondents having numerous LGBQ friends and family members, which may have limited our ability to detect differences across the models. In terms of the religious variables tested, our results are different than the general literature in these areas with only religious impor- tance being significant for predicting heterosexual privilege awareness, and neither religious affiliation nor religious attendance reaching a level of sig- nificance. In terms of the religion-related constructs, previous scholarship has demonstrated that college students’ personal values and beliefs are often at odds with their faith tradition’s teachings when denominational beliefs are not affirming of same-sex sexuality such that religious affiliation and religiosity variables diverge from the typical patterns on attitudes about LGBQ people found among the general U.S. population (see Woodford et al., 2013). JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN SOCIAL WORK 465 Social work educational variables Students who had taken a course with PPO content and those who endorsed higher levels of personal CSJO, were more likely to acknowledge both their heterosexual and cisgender privilege. Compared to BSW students, 2-year MSW students, and doctoral students indicated higher levels of both types of privilege, while advanced standing MSW students were not significantly dif- ferent than BSW students. The educational context variables are of particular interest since social work educators have control over how to infuse content that may positively impact students’ understanding of their privileges and therefore impact their willingness to embody the social justice values of the discipline. Our findings underscore the importance of introducing such con- tent, through courses that contain a discussion of power, privilege, and oppres- sion, and doing so particularly at the BSW level. Specific pedagogical strategies have been identified that show promise in moving students toward privilege recognition. Intergroup dialogue and techniques (e.g., power mapping and fish bowls) are increasingly used as methods to increase such privilege awareness. These can be incorporated through courses for credit (see https://igr.umich. edu/topic/courses-and-minor), or as tools in a specific course (Blumer et al., 2013; Dessel et al., 2013). Similarly, the use of caucusing to explore and grapple with privilege in single-identity caucuses appears to be a promising pedagogi- cal strategy as well (Walls et al., 2010). Classroom strategies to specifically address cisgender and heterosexual privilege might include role-playing and activities that challenge students (through active and passive statements and readings) to recognize privilege due to sexual orientation or gender identity, with follow-up assignments (Blumer et al., 2013) as well as additional caucus- ing (Walls et al., 2010) have also demonstrated effectiveness. Our findings additionally demonstrate that it is crucial that students under- stand social justice from a critical theory perspective – not at a superficial level, or in name only. Given that social justice is a foundation of social work (CSWE, 2022; National Association of Social Workers [NASW], 2017; Uehara et al., 2013) it is imperative that we are effectively communicating the meaning of social justice throughout social work educational programs while making clear connections between social justice and social work practice, including how our understanding of privilege is related to practice. This goal can be achieved not only through class discussions and readings, but also explicitly incorporating and connecting social justice to course assignments, providing explicit feedback on how students may or may not make clear the connection to social justice (Atteberry-Ash et al., 2019) and in internship supervision. Future studies as well should examine the effectiveness of the strategies mentioned above in both students’ identification of the privileges they hold and also how they understand social justice. The more effective educational strategies that programs integrate, the more dynamic and 466 B. ATTEBERRY-ASH ET AL. strategic programs can be in their course offerings in order to best promote a critical theory approach to social work education. Without the infusion of such strategies, as mentioned in the introduction, we may very well be perpetuating the biases and – isms we believe we are teaching against. Limitations As with much survey research, this study used cross-sectional data, meaning that these data are representative of one point in time. As such, findings are correlational and claims of causation cannot be made. The instrument captur- ing the endorsement of a critical orientation toward social justice (i.e., COSJS) is a recently developed scale that emerged from a conceptual review of the construct of social justice within social work scholarship (Atteberry-Ash, 2023). While the instrument has initially demonstrated good psychometric properties, further examination of the scale is warranted. Constructs included in the models examined in this study, such as political orientation, are captured solely using single items. For such multidimensional constructs, psychometrically tested scales would be preferable. Also, there may be an element of self-selection bias for those who took the survey; social work students who may be more familiar with LGBTQ+ individuals and causes may have been more likely to have decided to participate in the survey. Finally, some of the cell sizes for the categorical variables are small, indicating the need for future research with larger subsamples, which is particularly true for some racial/ethnic and sexual orientation cohorts. Conclusion Understanding privilege is important in preparing social workers to ade- quately address oppression, a critical element in the practice of social work and one that sets the profession apart from other social science and practice- focused disciplines. In examining awareness of heterosexual and cisgender privilege, this study above all offers support for inclusive pedagogical practices, including having a course that incorporates issues of power, privilege, and oppression and the infusion of social justice – with clear delineation of what exactly social justice means and how it is connected to social work, especially at the BSW level.
