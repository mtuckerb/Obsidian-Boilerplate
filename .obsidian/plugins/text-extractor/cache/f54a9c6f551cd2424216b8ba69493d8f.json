Explicit memory: Example(s): Implicit memory: Example(s): Part II: Tradi0onal Three-Stage Model of Memory vs. Working Memory Model Stage 1 of Three-Stage Model = DescripEon of this stage: DuraEon (how long can we hold informaEon in this stage?): Capacity (how much informaEon can we hold in this stage?) How do we move informaEon to the next stage?: Stage 2 of Three-Stage Model = DescripEon of this stage: DuraEon (how long can we hold informaEon in this stage?): Maintenance Rehearsal: Capacity (how much informaEon can we hold in this stage?) Chunking: How do we move informaEon to the next stage?: Elabora0ve Rehearsal: What is a serial posiEoning curve? Primacy Eﬀect: Recency Eﬀect: DETOUR to talk about the Working Memory Model What are some limitaEons of the 3-stage model? How is the idea of Working Memory diﬀerent from the 3-stage model? What are some of the proposed components of Working Memory? Stage 3 of Three-Stage Model = DescripEon of this stage: DuraEon (how long can we hold informaEon in this stage?): Capacity (how much informaEon can we hold in this stage?) Proposed Types of Long-Term Memory: • Declara0ve: Example: o Seman0c: Example: o Episodic: Example: • Procedural: Example: Part III: ForgePng What is the diﬀerence between recogni0on and recall? A memory has to be both ___________ and ____________ for us to be able to remember it. What reﬂecEons do you have based on our (or the book’s) discussion of the accuracy of memory? Types of forgePng • Decay theory: Example: • Amnesia: o Retrograde: Example: o Anterograde: Example: • Interference: o Proac0ve interference: Example: o Retroac0ve interference: Example: • Cue-dependent forgePng: Example: • Mo0vated ForgePng: Example:","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
