Tucker Bradford Sandra Dutkowsky PHI-275 2025-03-16 Gallagher's Argument In \"The Grounding of Forgiveness: Martha Nussbaum on Compassion and Mercy,\" Paul Gallagaher presents two contrasting views on the nature of compassion as a vehicle for extending Nussbaum's 4 conditions for compassion’s triumph over the Stoic virtue of mercy. Gallagher positions the pro-mercy (anti-pity) position of the Stoics against the pro-pitty or compassion position that Nussbaum defends, and then takes Nussbaum's argument further to explain how faced with one of the greatest atrocities in human history, the people of Hiroshima chose compassion over vengeance. The pro-mercy position (Stoic) In the Stoic (pro-mercy) position, the chief concern is that compassion is inadequate grounds to achieve forgiveness and that compassion while capable of driving judgment is incapable of determining correct judgments due to several factors. (Gallagher. p237). Further, the Stoics argue, pity ultimately leads to vengefulness, whereas mercy does not. The Stoics believe that \"ephemeral external goods, including friendship\" are unnecessary to ﬂourish (achieve Eudaemonia), and in fact, an alignment with such passions are demonstrably responsible for the human experience of tragedy, when deprived of such objects (e.g. ephemeral external goods). (Gallagher. p238). In a statement that is oddly reminiscent of Buddhist non-attachment, Gallagher posits \"The Stoic sage is therefore immune to tragedy, since nothing that would rob her of happiness can happen to the Stoic sage.\" (Gallagher. p238). According to Nussbaum, the Stoic believes that there are two fatal ﬂaws of compassion as a ground for ethical guidance. First, compassion will inevitably lead to vengeance against the perpetrator of wrongdoing. Rather than forgiving those who do harm to those I feel love and compassion for, my love for the victim that I know will more likely convert into a desire to inﬂict revenge on the unknown or little known victimizer, the Stoic has argued. The ironic outcome is that compassion is then the mother of war, both small-scale and large-scale (Gallagher. p238) Second, Simply because I believe that compassion has no value, I am subsequently inclined to also believe that it is never an appropriate response, \"Compassion is never an appropriate response insofar as it is grounded in giving value to what in fact has no real value.\" (Gallagher. p238) The pro-compassion position (Nussbaum) Nussbaum's position arises from an Aristotelian school of thought in which reason regulates emotions and that both are factors in achieving eudaemonia. Gallagher challenges the eudaemonistic judgment of the Aristotelian (and subsequently Nussbaumian) position, arguing that it lacks necessity and promotes locality. In other words \"there is no need that I make the judgment that the well-being of someone at work who I don’t particularly like is necessary for my own well-being.\" (Gallagher. p244) The work that Gallagher must therefore do is to extend Nussbaum's 4 conditions of compassion—1. The judgment of seriousness 2. The judgment of nondesert; 3. The judgment of similar possibilities. 4. The eudaemonistic judgment (Bein. p44).—to accommodate and overcome the Stoic assertion that such alignment with pity can only lead to vengeful action (which is not virtuous). Nussbaum (contends Gallagher) concedes that \"forgiveness is more at home with mercy\" as it promotes a \"hierarchical role reversal in the act of forgiveness inasmuch as the aggrieved party now must stand over the wrongdoer who has previously laid him or her low in order to grant forgiveness from above.\" (Gallagher. p246) It would be understandable for any considerate person 1 to concede, as Nussbaum has, that forgiveness, is of lesser value to ethical pursuit than compassion. However this would leave unanswered the insightful question Gallagher proposed in the thesis statement; why would the survivors of Hiroshima commit their energy to peace rather than vengeance. Gallagher resolves this seeming discrepancy between a mercy based forgiveness and a compassion based forgiveness: What is different in this compassion-based account of forgiveness is that it has come to pass through the three conditions of compassion being met. The suffering is recognized as severe; it is recognized as disproportionate to the wrongdoing; and, most signiﬁcantly, through the condition of similar circumstances, we recognize that we, too, but for a throw of the socioeconomic dice, could have been in the same condition as the wrongdoer. Furthermore, the eudaimonistic judgment has made the judgment that this person, simply as a fellow member of the human race, matters to me, and that to see an injustice perpetrated is to damage my own eudaimonia. And in all likelihood, it is at least in part my education, which has expanded my imagination by my understanding of what it means to live in tragic 1 This appeal to belief fallacy is just a cheeky skirting of the academic writing standard of not writing in the first person. circumstances, that has resulted in this inclusion. (Gallagher. p249) Here, Gallagher has expertly pulled the thread of compassionate response from Aristotle, through Nussbaum to (without explicitly specifying it) a quasi-Daoist position reﬂecting the ultimate interconnectedness of all things. In doing so he has resolved the Stoic arguments against pity (compassion) and the limitations of the essential-self that Western philosophy is encumbered by. An Evaluation As alluded to at the end of the last section, the path that Gallagher takes to extend Nussbaum's position is one that closely resembles the ﬁeld-of-selves model. Gallagher uses \"imagination\" as the vehicle for expanding one's concept of self, saying: The eudaimonistic judgment can expand its range and thereby expand the range of compassion by our cultivating other mental capacities that act to break down various impediments that hamper one portion of humanity from seeing that it shares similar possibilities with another portion of humanity. (Gallagher. p245) Embedded in the above is the invocation of a concept similar to \"authoritative personhood,\" (Bein. p71) that Gallagher presents in the following: Nussbaum’s primary suggestion for how the imagination would assist the eudaemonistic judgment in expanding its orbit to simulate the equality and dignity of all attained by the Stoics at the expense of emotion, is through education (Gallagher. p246) Bein's contrasting of Eastern and Western schools of thought established a polarity that seemed antagonistic and insoluble. Gallagher's article provides a simple extension of Nussbaum's philosophy of compassion which gracefully adds a westernized take on two core tenets of the Confucianist and Daoist traditions; that of the anātman and authoritative personhood. Given the foundational question of how a peace-centered practice arose from an abominable tragedy in an Eastern contextual landscape, the elegance of this merging of Eastern and Western philosophy is particularly potent. Would the outcome have been the same if the context of the atrocity was focused on a Western landscape and people? It is hard to imagine, but perhaps with a bridging philosophy such as Galllager presents, we inch closer to that ideal.
