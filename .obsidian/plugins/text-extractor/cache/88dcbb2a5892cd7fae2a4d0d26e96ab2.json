Miller The University of North Carolina at Charlotte Richmond D. Wynn and Kristine W. Webb University of North Florida Prior research related to both LGBTQ identities and disability in education has considered the role of identity management strategies including passing and selective disclosure, though little research has addressed the experiences of queer students with disabilities who manage multiple marginalized iden- tities. This qualitative study analyzes the disclosure processes enacted by 31 LGBTQ students with disabilities at two universities in the southern United States. Themes included students’ descriptions of (a) disclosing identities for self/others, (b) disclosing identities indirectly, and (c) passing for privileged identities. Findings suggest implications for higher education institutions and leaders seeking to support queer students with disabilities. Keywords: LGBTQ, disability, disclosure, passing, identity management Though some scholarship has addressed identity disclosure de- cisions of students with disabilities and queer students as separate groups, thus far, research has not explored the disclosure decisions of students who live at the intersections of these identities. This study considers the following research question: How do self- identified LGBTQ students with disabilities at two universities in the South describe the purposes of disclosure and nondisclosure of their disability and LGBTQ identities? This article first reviews literature on queer and disability identity disclosure and invento- ries the study’s methods before recounting findings of students’ processes of disclosing identities for self/others, disclosing iden- tities indirectly, and passing for privileged identities. The article concludes with implications for practice and research. This article distinguishes between concepts of identity and dis- closure of identity. Tajfel’s (1981) social identity theory posits social identity as “that part of the individual’s self-concept which derives from their knowledge of their membership in a social group (or groups) together with the value and emotional signifi- cance attached to that membership” (p. 255). Disclosure refers to communicating or sharing one’s identity with others. Particular social identities, including some disabilities (Kerschbaum, Eisen- man, & Jones, 2017), trans \u0002 identities (Singh, Meng, & Hansen, 2014), and LGB identities (Meyer, 2013), may be concealed or disclosed by individuals in particular contexts. Thus, one’s internal sense of social identity may vary from one’s decisions to exter- nally share that identity and claim group membership. For exam- ple, Fassinger and Miller (1997) distinguished between aspects of individual and group identification of sexual minority status among lesbians and gay men. It must be noted that the terms LGBTQ and disability encom- pass enormous diversity and varied experiences and identities (see Kimball, Wells, Ostiguy, Manly, & Lauterbach, 2016; Renn, 2010). Studies that address specific identities within these larger umbrella labels will be identified as such. Some studies use broader labels if they recruited and included participants across identities. However, there are limitations to such an approach, an issue noted by Nicolazzo (2015), who pointed out that many LGBTQ studies include few trans \u0002 participants. Such studies may attempt to generalize findings as though they are equally applica- ble to trans \u0002 and lesbian, gay, and bisexual participants. Literature Review This section reviews research on the disclosure and identity management strategies of students with disabilities and LGBTQ students, followed by consideration of identity intersectionality and the limited literature on identity disclosure approaches of self-identified queer students with disabilities. Disability and Disclosure An individual may be considered as having a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (2008) in any of the three circumstances that encompass the legislative definition of an individual with a disability: (a) Individuals have an impairment that substantially limits a major life function (e.g., eating, learning, speaking, walking), (b) Individuals who have a record of history of such an impairment, and (c) Individuals who are regarded as having such an impairment. Particular types of disabilities may be more or less visible. According to a report on This article was published Online First August 2, 2018. Ryan A.

Journal of Diversity in Higher Education © 2018 National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education 2019, Vol. 12, No. 4, 307–318 1938-8926/19/$12.00 http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dhe0000083 307 college students with disabilities, nearly three fourths of students had diagnosed disabilities such as learning disabilities, attention disorders, psychiatric conditions, or chronic health conditions (Raue & Lewis, 2011), conditions commonly characterized as invisible disabilities. As early as 1963, invisible disabilities were described as those disabilities that are not generally observable or apparent, and as a result, individuals have the choice to disclose or not disclose their disabilities (Clair, Beatty, & Maclean, 2005; Goffman, 1963; Matthews & Harrington, 2000). Students with invisible disabilities have less difficulty “passing” than their peers with visible disabilities or those who use assistive devices (Mills, 2017). A synthesis of the literature on students with mental health problems revealed difficulties with disclosure (Markoulakis & Kirsh, 2013). Students with cognitive, psychiatric, and physical disabilities in Olney and Brockelman’s (2003) study demon- strated awareness that disclosure of a disability would change others’ attitudes toward them. Olney and Brockelman reframed denial and passing as nondisabled from a negative frame of reference that indicated shame or fear to a positive or neutral set of interpersonal skills students could choose to deploy. Students often referred positively to their disabilities while expressing knowledge that those without disabilities viewed them nega- tively (Olney & Brockelman, 2003). Managing perceptions became one way that students with disabilities asserted their agency and independence. In a study about students with learning disabilities, Troiano (2003) proposed that time of diagnosis, per- ceived support, level of stigmatization, and personality attributes all influenced students’ self-styled understandings of disability. Students’ relationship to their learning disability affected their ability to self-advocate, level of self-determination, and willing- ness to disclose. Students with visible disabilities, such as many physical disabilities, may not have the option of passing as nondisabled (Kimball, Moore, Vaccaro, Troiano, & Newman, 2016). Those with less visible disabilities may be better able to adopt various degrees of disability disclosure depending on context (Collins & Mowbray, 2005) but may also be less likely to seek help and use available services (Kimball et al., 2016; Kranke, Jackson, Taylor, Anderson-Fye, & Floersch, 2013). Gill (1997) framed “coming out” as a person with a disability as “integrating how we feel with how we present ourselves” (p. 39). Disclosing a disability in higher education may be necessary to receive particular accommodations, while disclosure in the working world may be viewed as a detriment to career success or even being seen as competent (Riddell & Weedon, 2014). Riddell and Weedon (2014) asserted that self-identification as disabled, particularly for those whose disabilities are not readily appar- ent, involved balancing the advantages and disadvantages of disclosure. In one study, college student activists with disabil- ities described disclosing their disabilities in the course of their activism and attempting to reduce disability stigma (Kimball et al., 2016). Through the lens of ableism, Hutcheon and Wolbring (2012) noted students with a variety of disabilities in their study disclosed their disability in ways that may or may not have aligned with their self-identifications given the university’s view of disability as an individualized, medical phenomenon. LGBTQ Identities and Disclosure The ubiquitous need to “come out” as LGBTQ via a linear disclosure process has been critiqued (Klein, Holtby, Cook, & Travers, 2015). Klein et al.’s (2015) participants “described the ways in which coming out is complicated by forms of privilege and oppression and by other contextual factors such as levels of social support, financial independence, one’s relationship with one’s family, and one’s geographical location” (p. 320), leading the authors to conclude that linear models of development errone- ously assume “a final queer subject who is out, proud, and nor- matively happy” (p. 320). Klein et al. (2015) found LGBTQ youth regarded disclosure as an ongoing, dynamic, and contextual pro- cess. Orne’s (2011, 2013) work on strategic outness and identity management complicated the assertion that all LGBTQ people should necessarily disclose their identities regardless of context. A study on the visibility management strategies of LGB students revealed that students used a careful decision-making process and often employed nonverbal strategies to control identity disclosure, including passing, silence, and selective disclosure (Lasser & Wicker, 2007). LGB youth may deploy such visibility manage- ment strategies in an effort to cope with discrimination, harass- ment, and other forms of minority stress (D’haese, Dewaele, & Van Houtte, 2016; Dewaele, Van Houtte, Cox, & Vincke, 2013). Rather than advocating that LGB youth come out in all circum- stances or remain completely closeted about their sexual identities, the researchers advocated a more holistic view of visibility man- agement that includes an evaluation of context, benefits, and risks (D’haese et al., 2016; Dewaele et al., 2013). A study by Patton (2011) in which gay and bisexual Black men at a historically Black college were “selectively out” (p. 87) also helped to complicate the traditional “coming out” narrative. Men in Patton’s study disclosed their sexual orientation differently depending on context, rele- vance, and relationships, and pushed back against traditional no- tions of disclosure, asserting, “coming out was not a public pro- cess” (Patton, 2011, p. 86). In addition, research has described the energy and emotional labor of disclosing trans \u0002 identities and passing as cisgender in higher education (Catalano, 2015; Nicolazzo, 2016a, 2016b). Cis- gender refers to a person whose assigned sex matches self- identified gender. Catalano (2015) described the “contradictory terms” through which trans men in his study viewed passing: “On one hand, passing was seen as an achievement, on the other, passing resulted in silencing and invisibility” (p. 421). Disclosure and Intersecting Disability/ LGBTQ Identities Considerations of identity disclosure have rarely considered disability and LGBTQ identities in tandem. Intersectionality is one prominent lens through which to examine the experiences of individuals who live with multiple marginalized social identities (Torres, Jones, & Renn, 2009). Through the lens of intersection- ality, researchers consider individuals’ experiences in the context of multiple, overlapping systems of oppression, and social identi- ties “are interdependent and mutually constitutive” (Bowleg, 2008, p. 312). Though research incorporating intersectional frameworks in higher education has increased (e.g., Abes, 2012; Jones & Abes,ThisdocumentiscopyrightedbytheAmericanPsychologicalAssociationoroneofitsalliedpublishers.Thisarticleisintendedsolelyforthepersonaluseoftheindividualuserandisnottobedisseminatedbroadly. 308 MILLER, WYNN, AND WEBB 2013; Stewart, 2009), studies specifically highlighting intersec- tions of LGBTQ and disability identities remain rare. Apart from the present study, one study in higher education reports findings from a gay undergraduate male with a physical disability, who said he experienced less discrimination based on sexual orientation, positioned as an invisible identity, than he did based on a readily visible disability (Henry, Fuerth, & Figliozzi, 2010). A study on British lesbians and gay men with disabilities found experiences of marginalization within both disability and gay communities (Shakespeare, 1999). Participants in the study reflected on a long and complex coming out process related to disability and queerness (Shakespeare, 1999). Samuels (2003) critiqued the problematic tendency to analogize the two identities, highlighting in particular comparisons related to disclosure and passing between nonvisible disabilities (e.g., chronic illness) and nonvisible queer identities (e.g., lesbian-femme): While there are a number of queer accouterments... that I could (and often do) choose to wear to signal my lesbian identity, a very different cultural weight is placed on any attempt to signal a disabled identity, as suspicions of fraud attach to any visible sign of disability that is not functionally essential. (pp. 240 –241) In Samuels’ view, comparisons of “coming out” about disability and queer identities are oversimplified. Retelling the story of an undergraduate student and cautioning against the simplistic appli- cation of analogies among social identities, Samuels (2003) re- flected on the shifting and contested meanings of disability; the uneasy, often self-destroying tension between appearance and identity; the social scrutiny that refuses to accept statements of identity without “proof”; and, finally, the discursive and practical connections between coming out—in all the meanings of the term—as queer and as disabled. (p. 233) Little research has addressed disclosure decisions of LGBTQ students with disabilities. Miller, Wynn, and Webb (2017a) de- scribed students’ decisions to disclose contextually, disclose stra- tegically, avoid disclosure, and compare processes of queer/dis- ability disclosure. Queer students with disabilities also expended significant time and energy managing their online presence and identity, often opting to disclose their identities in virtual venues (Miller, 2017). Methodology We used a qualitative approach in this study, given our research question that sought to uncover the purposes of students’ disclo- sure and nondisclosure of disability and LGBTQ identities. Qual- itative methods provided an outlet to understand participants’ experiences in depth (Jones, Torres, & Arminio, 2014). Such methods can be particularly illuminating in studying the experi- ences and centering the voices of members of diverse populations (Lyons et al., 2013). Specifically, the principles of constructivist grounded theory guided this research (Charmaz, 2014). In line with constructivist grounded theory, we used an inductive ap- proach to guide our work rather than relying extensively on prior theories, sampled participants for theoretical purposes, used com- parative data analysis methods, and developed provisional catego- ries used to report on our research. We prioritized capturing participants’ meaning of their identity management experiences in their own words, an approach well matched for qualitative research methods, including our use of intensive, one-on-one interviews (Charmaz, 2014). We do not present an objective reality of our research findings, but rather, emphasize that this product is a construction of the research process itself and the lenses we as researchers bring to this project. Data Collection and Analysis This study draws upon secondary analysis of two projects. The first study (University 1) included interviews with 25 LGBTQ students with disabilities, while the second study (University 2) included 6 LGBTQ students with disabilities (see Table 1). Both universities are public, predominantly White institutions in the Southern U.S. The second study was conducted after data collec- tion from the first study concluded. The researchers collaborated on development of the second study, with methods mirroring those used in the first. Thus, we report on the projects’ methods collec- tively and refer to the secondary analysis of both projects as “the study.” We sought participants who were at least 18 years old, presently enrolled as graduate or undergraduate students, and who self- identified both with a disability of any kind (an approach taken by Hutcheon & Wolbring, 2012, to avoid relying on medicalized definitions of disability) and as LGBTQ. Participants were re- cruited by using the electronic mailing lists of the disability and LGBT resource centers on both campuses, and emails were sent to students by staff at the disability and LGBT resource centers. At this point in the study, the researchers did not have access to student identities or emails. Follow up emails were sent to poten- tial participants by the centers. We also recruited participants via listservs and social media pages of campus-based disability and LGBTQ student organizations and academic programs. Students contacted the researchers by phone or e-mail if they were interested in participating. During this initial contact, stu- dents were presented with the study inclusion criteria (18 years old, disability, LGBTQ) and asked if they met these criteria. Participants who met the study criteria scheduled a meeting to complete a consent form and take part in an interview. Each interview lasted approximately one to two hours, and students were informed they had the option of participating in a follow-up interview if they needed to finish the first interview. All interview sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and entered into qual- itative data analysis software. Intensive interviewing entails “a gently-guided, one-sided conversation that explores research par- ticipants’ perspective on their personal experience with the re- search topic” (Charmaz, 2014, p. 56). Successful intensive inter- views recruit information-rich participants, explore experiences in depth, and use open-ended questions to produce detailed responses (Charmaz, 2014). One-on-one interviews also offered the benefit of protecting participant confidentiality. We reflected on the inter- view process itself as a performance and/or a possible site for identity work, rather than as a reflection of an objective reality (Alvesson, 2011; Charmaz, 2014). We sought to maximize flexi- bility and openness in our conversations with participants. Flexi- bility meant allowing participants to determine the interview time and location. While 29 participants chose to meet at the research-ThisdocumentiscopyrightedbytheAmericanPsychologicalAssociationoroneofitsalliedpublishers.Thisarticleisintendedsolelyforthepersonaluseoftheindividualuserandisnottobedisseminatedbroadly. 309THIS REALLY INTERESTING JUGGLING ACT er’s office, one chose a library room and one chose a departmental conference room. As a team, we developed interview questions that would help us answer the research question. We conducted two pilot interviews to test and refine these questions and incorporated feedback from the pilot interviewees. The interview protocol addressed partici- pants’ lives as students on campus, including their personal and social identities. We asked students open-ended questions: “How do you describe or identify yourself to others?” “How would you describe the relationship among your multiple identities?” “What are some key moments that you would say led to how you currently identify yourself?” In the course of answering these questions, participants frequently elaborated about whether and how they disclosed particular identities. We engaged in several coding techniques consistent with con- structivist grounded theory methods in developing the findings presented here. First, each researcher reviewed transcripts individ- ually and engaged in initial line-by-line coding to surface possible patterns within interviews and in vivo coding to emphasize par- ticipants’ own words (Charmaz, 2014; Saldaña, 2009). Then, we compared initial codes across transcripts and arrived at more than 100 initial codes for the collective interview data. After additional reflection and research team meetings, we regrouped these initial codes into focused codes. As a subset of the larger study, findings and categories presented come from the “performing identities contextually” focused code. We identified three themes presented in this article that encapsulated the patterns related to disclosure of disability and LGBTQ identities. All three researchers participated in all phases of data analysis and reached consensus on the find- ings presented in this article. Trustworthiness and Researcher Positionalities Strategies for achieving trustworthiness in qualitative research, as outlined by Williams and Morrow (2009), include ensuring integrity of the data, balancing researcher interpretations and par- ticipants’ meaning, and clearly communicating and applying find- ings. We sought to promote integrity of the data and communica- tion of findings by clearly explaining our methods, sharing multiple examples and quotations that illuminate our findings, and documenting each phase of the study via research memos, partic- ipant transcripts, codebooks and applied codes, and article drafts.

We engaged in member checking by first sharing transcripts and later sharing emerging findings with participants. Participants provided clarification or corrections to portions of the interview transcripts. Some participants also offered feedback on the emerg- ing findings of the study and participated in campus events where we presented this research, including at a research presentation at University 2 and a disability conference at University 1 where four participants shared their experiences on a panel. As another strategy to balance researcher and participant mean- ing, we reflected on our own backgrounds and positionality throughout all phases of the study (Jones et al., 2014). We share some facets of our identities to position ourselves in relation to this research: Kris is a Caucasian woman who identifies as female and heterosexual, has two diagnosed disabilities, and is married, middle-aged, and middle class. She is a professor in special education and has years of experience interacting with individuals who have disabilities. Rich- mond is African American, gay, cisgender, male, and does not have a disability. He is a married, middle-class, assistant professor and di- rector of an academic program in clinical mental health counseling with several years of experience as a practitioner in the field. Ryan is a faculty member in a higher education program with a background in student development and diversity affairs at several institutions. He is a white, middle-class, cisgender, queer person without a diagnosed disability and is a first-generation college graduate. (Miller, Wynn, & Webb, 2017b) Authors wrote scholarly personal narratives that addressed our relationships to the study, as well as our own disclosure experi- ences (see Miller et al., 2017b). For example, the first author reflected upon his formative experiences in queer organizations and communities that prioritized the value of disclosing queer identities, a value which he internalized and continues to unpack in his personal and professional life. Our varied personal and profes- sional backgrounds strengthened the design and analysis of this study, in which all researchers participated equally in all phases. Our team approach also increased the possible interpretations of the data and thus aided in balancing participant subjectivity and researcher reflexivity (Williams & Morrow, 2009). Through re- flective memo writing and frequent research team meetings, we made it a priority to discuss the impact of who we are on our design choices, participants, analysis, and write up of results. Findings This section addresses the three themes of this study that relate to participants’ goals for and decisions about disclosing identities. Students described processes of (a) disclosing identities for self/ others, (b) disclosing identities indirectly, and (c) passing for privileged identities. In presenting findings, we note two important caveats. First, participants described disclosing or concealing their identities differently according to context, highlighting the nonbi- nary nature of disclosure (i.e., disclosure was not a one-time decision). All 31 students described their disabilities as hidden or invisible and remarked that they could occasionally pass as non- disabled, depending on context. Participants also claimed that they did not consistently present or read as queer to others, also en- abling them to pass as cisgender and/or heterosexual. This ability to determine whether to disclose significantly shaped the findings of our study, as people with more highly visible disabilities and/or queer identities would likely think differently about how they manage expression and visibility or their identities. Second, though study participants lived at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities, their descriptions of disclosure processes often drew upon additive or singular approaches to identity (i.e., participants described disclosing disability or LGBTQ identities in isolation). By contrast, intersectionality positions identities as “in- terdependent and mutually constitutive” (Bowleg, 2008, p. 312), yet such an intersectional perspective is not often evident in participants’ words. Disclosing Identities for Self/Others: “Being out Is a Way of Being There for People” Participants shared examples of disclosing strategically and contextually in ways that would benefit others and/or themselves. Benefits to disclosing for themselves might be connecting with others and being able to focus on other topics by getting disclosure out of the way. Thus, potentially disclosing one’s identities to others could become a strategy to benefit oneself. Miranda, who identified as being on the autism spectrum, summed up this posi- tion, pointing out she was better able to concentrate when she avoided eye contact in conversation: I have had an easier time because I do not have to hide things that I had to hide in my master’s program, which makes it easier to focus on my work and get stuff done. It’s not a huge deal. I do not worry about eye contact with people here, because I figured out after a month or so, nobody cares. They really do not. They do not care, and nobody is trying to diagnose me here, and nobody thinks any less of me for whatever characteristic I’m showing at the time that they happen to know about. So that’s nice. When she was able to clear her mind from worrying about disclosure, she could focus more on her work. Will, on the other hand, described a decision to come out as gay to others that would benefit himself: “I guess at a certain point I realized, like, if I don’t come out before I go to college, then I’m going to have a really shitty time at college,” he explained. Abby outlined a balancing act between being out for others and ensuring her own safety. I decided really early on that part of the reason I think that I struggled so much with my sexuality was not having people that I could relate to....Tome, it’s just like being out is, in part, a way of being there for people. I try and make it a point of being out whenever possible, whenever it’s safe and makes sense to do so. That sort of practice of doing it, not just doing it for myself, but also for other people, I think, factors in somewhat with disclosure about the disability stuff. I think that one is just a lot more dicey still, especially when thinking about applying to jobs and stuff. Abby’s process involved weighing factors such as safety for herself and how her disclosure could benefit others. Other strategic disclosures for self involved concerns about mental and emotional health. While Brad chose to disclose his gender identity to people with whom he had already developed some degree of trust, the timing of his disclosure was based on his desire to prevent what he observed as worsening depression.ThisdocumentiscopyrightedbytheAmericanPsychologicalAssociationoroneofitsalliedpublishers.Thisarticleisintendedsolelyforthepersonaluseoftheindividualuserandisnottobedisseminatedbroadly. 311THIS REALLY INTERESTING JUGGLING ACT I tried to deny it to myself like, nah, it’s just a phase, I’ll eventually feel comfortable once I’m finished, you know, puberty and growing and everything. I’ll eventually figure out I’ll be okay with my body and it never happened and then I kind of felt more and more out of like sync with my body and I’m like okay then I started becoming even more depressed. I just started going into severe depression trying to pretend to be a girl. It was not until the summer I was like, I cannot do this anymore and I came out to a couple of my friends who I knew would be accepting and they were like oh, one of them knew me from high school and was like, yeah, I kind of already knew this. Other participants described occasionally disclosing identities expressly for the benefit of others. Sebastian said: “If someone comes out and tells me that they have a disability, I’ll generally tell them that I have one as a form of solidarity or something. I am a good guy, and I try to be supportive.” Marie said she might wait to find out if someone was in the community (either LGBTQ or disability communities) and then disclose: “If someone tells me that they’re in the community, I have no problem saying, ‘Hey, me too.’” Several participants talked about participating in panel dis- cussions or public events on disability and sexuality, which neces- sitated disclosure but benefitted others. Though Madison usually only disclosed identities if she considered it relevant, she ap- proached these events differently, sharing that she disclosed dis- ability while serving on a panel in a course promoting diversity in science fields. Dani discussed disclosing her sexuality in front of a class in her professional program, based on a question about the ring she was wearing. I realized it was the first time I have come out to a group of people all at once. That was actually kind of scary for me. I was not expecting it to be. I absolutely would have come out to anyone of them one on one. Just standing in front of a full classroom of students and the professor and everyone and talking about my fiancé, who is a she, as I always do. Dani felt some anxiety approaching the moment of disclosure in front of a large group, but preferred to disclose rather than having others wonder or mistakenly assume she was with a man. For Dani, being a person who did not “look gay” resulted in the need to “come out over and over” so that she could avoid assumptions of heterosexuality that made her uncomfortable. Similarly, Haley said that talking about disability in a class could “out” her as a person with disabilities. She described a willingness to speak about disability publicly if it could prevent another person from facing a negative reaction: “I’ve always been the magnet for discrimination and hate on purpose, because I have this arrogant idea that I can take it. I would rather it be me than someone else.” Haley desired to take on hostile reactions so that others might not have to do so. Jason also discussed altruistic reasons for disclosing his trans identity: One of my classmates... kept asking me questions like...Iwas the spokesperson for every trans person. I mean, I know he’s just not as well educated and he’s a really cool guy but I just kinda work with what I can and not be mad and just try to work with and educate him. Jason expressed similar experiences related to his disability identity saying, “I’ve actually met really good friends and I’ve helped educate them on vision stuff, along with my bipolar.” Other students reported having feelings of isolation from their peers when they disclosed their disabilities. Lauren remarked, “No matter how big the crowd is, I’m in the room by myself. Always.” She discussed how she felt segregated because of her disability and her family’s history of disability. Literally, I was held back because my speech didn’t—I was not at the age appropriate levels as my peers, and growing up in a Deaf house- hold, we spoke ASL as our primary language and no one at my school spoke ASL so they didn’t have that sort of connection to myself and my parents. So, growing up I felt segregated and had to interpret a lot of parent-teacher meetings as a kid. Students realized that performances of queer, disabled, and intersecting social identities could help them accomplish goals such as providing visibility to disability and queer communities and reassuring others struggling with their identities. These bene- fits did not erase the downsides of repeated disclosures, but per- haps helped temper the drawbacks. For Diego, his disclosure of identities in various contexts was strategic and offered a way for him to be an activist. Diego described the strategic desire to become the “face” of disability in a meeting with administrators when the topic was addressed: I was with the dean in a meeting last week and I brought up the issue of my disability.... That was a moment that I felt like this had to be brought to the table to be public, that a face had to be put on it. That was a strategic decision, and I didn’t think about it as a strategic decision, I just felt like, you know, as the conversation was developing that I had to say something. But I didn’t go into the room the first time and say, “I’m a representative from [disability services] and a grad- uate student.”... When I started seeing this conversation turn in a way that was going to curtail or you know keep it from moving forward that’s when I chose you say, well hold on, this was a moment when I realized that I needed to say something. Especially because there are people in that room who do not understand the challenges that a lot of students face. He used the opportunity to educate the dean on the treatment of disability at the university and contrasted the university’s approach to physical/mobility impairments with engagement of “invisible” disabilities. Diego decided when he wanted to publicly identify as a person with a disability and, more so, as an advocate for people with disabilities. It also offered a way for Diego to be true to his passions as an activist using tempered strategies: “Even though... I’m not like in front of a tower with a sign, I’m still doing it constructively.” Disclosing Identities Indirectly: “If You Know Me, You Can Tell” Disclosing identities indirectly involves the use of symbols and aids also known as signifiers that convey information about a person’s identity. Students shared several examples of potentially disclosing their queer identities indirectly, two of which involved wedding rings as signifiers, including Dani’s experience, noted in the prior section about others noticing her wedding ring, which led to a direct disclosure of her identity. Rodney recalled “times when people have seen my wedding ring and said something about my wife” rather than husband, and he did not correct them. He used that approach for “one-shot interactions” rather than ongoing re- lationships with people. Some aspects of Jason’s gender expres-ThisdocumentiscopyrightedbytheAmericanPsychologicalAssociationoroneofitsalliedpublishers.Thisarticleisintendedsolelyforthepersonaluseoftheindividualuserandisnottobedisseminatedbroadly. 312 MILLER, WYNN, AND WEBB sion and physical appearance functioned as indirect disclosures of his transgender identity in interactions with his mother: “She asked me why do you wear guys’ underwear and I’m like, what, they’re comfy...and she’s like oh okay whatever she writes that off and then the time before that I was wearing a binder, a chest binder, and she didn’t know what it was and I said well it makes my chest look flat and she was okay that’s fine and whatever and uh I have my hair short and everything else.” The vast majority of examples students shared of disclosing identities indirectly focused on disability, which students often viewed as riskier than disclosing queer identities, particularly in university settings. Participants noted the importance of under- standing how their identities mattered in various spaces and how they were being read, seen, or interpreted by others. For some, even declaring an identity became contextual, as Diego explained: “Typically, I don’t outwardly proclaim an identity. And, it’s some- thing that I feel you have to—you either have to get to know me or you have to—I have to feel comfortable around you.” He made decisions about identity expression that might vary from person to person and setting to setting. He gave an example of wanting his roommate to know why he took medication—a symbol through which he may have indirectly disclosed disability. A relationship needed to be in place, Diego explained: “You either have to get to know me or I have to feel comfortable around you before I’m willing to engage certain topics or areas of my identity with you.” Most participants in this study identified with disabilities that would traditionally be labeled as hidden or invisible, but they also pointed out that particular symbols or actions would make their disabilities visible. Typically, a medical aspect of disability such as fatigue, pain, or a panic attack might prompt students to use or display a signifier. The signifier then heightened students’ aware- ness of how they presented themselves and were in turn perceived by others, at times leading students to engage in or avoid conver- sation about disability. Though students often expressed avoidance of or fatigue with such conversations, some also expressed relief that their disabilities would be perceived as legitimate with the aid of a signifier. At times, Sandy used a service dog on campus, and she realized that she lost her ability to pass as nondisabled when she did. She weighed the risks of daily life on campus without her service dog against the benefits of not “having people look at you all day long.” Side effects from medication, such as trembling while teaching in Elijah’s case, could also make a disability visible. Jackie said she knew that scars from cutting herself could prompt questions or stares from others. Miranda, who prided herself on dressing fashionably, became frustrated with the appearance of a cane that she occasionally needed to walk: When I put together a certain look, I like to look a certain way sometimes. I will get very upset if I’ve got my cane, and I’m like, “No, it throws off my whole look. I hate this.” I’m not necessarily trying to pass as nondisabled. I just do not want it to mess with my look. I’m like, this does not go....Alot of times people who haven’t noticed it before, are like, “Oh my God, did you hurt yourself?” and I have to go ahead and explain, no. Miranda also shared that she tended to rock back and forth while intently reading or typing—“the more I get into it, the more it looks like I’m about to take flight”—which she believed others noticed. She noted happily that peers still talked with her and included her, a feeling of belonging that she did not experience in previous schooling experiences. For Eva, a calorie-counting application on her phone made her conscious about whether others thought she had an eating disorder. Assistive technology revealed Dani’s visual disabilities, as she used an application on her laptop to read textbooks that she felt classmates perceived as unusual. She noticed that while studying on campus, she preferred to position herself and her computer screen so the application might be less visible to others. The other people in my study group have been very observant of the fact that I have a learning disability. It is visible to them in a way that I do not think it’s ever been visible to people in my life. I read slowly. I miss words. They can see it, so I do not feel as self-conscious about it because it validates the accommodations I receive. I also think just people being older, there’s an understanding that I wouldn’t be using this very slow computer program compared to how everyone else reads if it was not a real thing. Dani had mixed feelings about her disabilities becoming visible. The visibility gave her the sense that accommodations were justi- fied and thus legitimized disability. Disability could also become visible in interpersonal settings. For almost all participants, particularly undergraduates, securing and navigating disability accommodations in class served as a process that could make disability apparent. Students who lived with depression and anxiety and faced occasional days when they could not get out of bed struggled with how to explain their absences to professors without appearing to be lazy. Abby, Diego, and Sebastian all described wanting to avoid the impression that they might fall asleep when energy waned or pain occurred. All three were graduate students and discussed the impact of long classes and days. Sebastian said, “if you know me, you can tell. The eyelids start drooping. You can tell when I’m having a not-great day.” A coffee cup in Diego’s hands became ubiquitous, while Abby grudgingly accepted a daily medication regimen. Abby noted that she always turned down evening and late-night social invitations from peers, as having narcolepsy dictated her sleep schedule. Marie also found herself turning down invitations from friends, as deviating from her routine increased her anxiety. Will, who identified as having Asperger’s, discussed needing to leave early from social situations or meetings if he became over- whelmed and needed alone time. If they were going to be sick, Adrianna and Jackie said they left classes abruptly and knew others wondered why. Passing for Privileged Identities: A “Double-Edged Sword” Students in this study reflected on the notion of passing for another social identity, particularly on passing as nondisabled, heterosexual, and/or cisgender. Several participants voiced aware- ness that the potential to pass as another identity could be regarded as a privilege in some instances. Zachary viewed his ability to pass at most times as not having a disability or being queer as a privilege, but with its own drawbacks: I can pass as straight if I need to. It’s something that I have learned as a survival instinct when I was younger. Because of that, people interpreted me as not being in people’s faces, is what they like to use as far as the words. It can be kind of bittersweet. I do not want toThisdocumentiscopyrightedbytheAmericanPsychologicalAssociationoroneofitsalliedpublishers.Thisarticleisintendedsolelyforthepersonaluseoftheindividualuserandisnottobedisseminatedbroadly. 313THIS REALLY INTERESTING JUGGLING ACT annoy people with my identity, but at the same time I do want to have space to explore my identity if I want to. I do not like the idea that people look down upon those who are more flamboyant or in your face or whatever. Madison referred to herself as an expert at passing for nondis- abled, particularly at times when she had more physical energy to participate in activities: Right now, I do not need a cane to walk, and because I ride my bike every day, it’s helped me be better in general. I can go for walks with people, I can do activities with people, and for the most part, even if I get exhausted, I can push through it. I can evade the disability identity here pretty well, and I think most people have no idea that I’m queer, so I definitely can pass that way. In terms of the autism spectrum stuff, I’ve been dealing with it long enough that I feel like I can pass, for the most part....I’m an expert at passing. For Madison, passing functioned as a way to make a positive impression on others and as a way to maintain social relationships that she felt might otherwise diminish. She would rather “pass and have people not have any idea that there’s anything wrong” with her. On the other hand, Lauren did not want to feel excluded from social gatherings, but intentionally removed herself from activities such as concerts to avoid directly addressing that she was hard of hearing: As far as having a disability, for me, that’s easy to hide. I do not have to tell anyone and they’ll never know....I mean, there are still some things that I do not enjoy going to—live concerts and things like that because it’s sensory overload for me and I cannot hear things properly and then I feel excluded. So socially, I do not like doing those things but I do not think I identify with it. I just say, “I don’t like doing them.” Likewise, Kristen said that she sometimes found it easier “just to pretend you’re straight and not have to out yourself if you don’t have to,” particularly in an employment context, as she noted employment discrimination was still legal in the state. Similarly, Brad acknowledged that when meeting people, “the first time I introduce myself as Brad, and they’re like ‘Oh, okay,’ and they see me as a guy,” and did not necessarily see him as transgender. The orientation toward passing as needed was not shared by other students in the study who perceived themselves as less able to convincingly pass, often depending on their gender expression, disability signifiers, and whether they were viewed as fulfilling particular stereotypes of LGBTQ people or people with disabili- ties. For example, Madison and Miranda sometimes used a cane to walk, and at those times they felt unable to pass as able-bodied. While acknowledging that being able to pass for a nonmargin- alized identity was beneficial at times, participants noted that it also enacted a burden to continually manage the appearance and disclosure associated with an identity—which both Marie and Taylor labeled a “double-edged sword.” This burden could lead to the perception that one’s identities were erased at times, as Taylor elaborated on regarding their queer and nonbinary identities: “It’s hurting me because my identities are being erased. Because I’m with a man doesn’t mean that I’m not queer and all this other stuff, and because I dress like a woman doesn’t mean I’m a woman, these sorts of things.” Likewise, while Marie acknowledged ben- efits of passing, she also noted that she did not feel as connected to LGBTQ communities: I know I’m not a target a lot of the times for... slurs and violence, but also, working my way into these communities can be really hard. I walk into these LGBTQ spaces and I sometimes feel like people assume I’m like the gay guy’s best friend and I’m the straight girl. You know, dating’s been really hard because people assume that I’m straight. Marie, who identified as lesbian and experienced anxiety and depression, explained how she approached the ongoing task of deciding whether and how to disclose her multiple identities, including whether to attempt to pass or hide particular identities: While I like to sort of pretend that I can pull out my magic tricks and say, “OK. Right now, I’m just going to be this version of myself,” and those other parts of me that I want to sort of put to the side are going to be put to the side. Sometimes, it’s really unrealistic to expect that I can do that because all of that is always going to be played out when I’m interacting with someone. I think to some extent that also pre- cludes me from getting close to some people or makes it even more difficult to get close to people because I cannot truly act like myself because I’m trying to hide these things or I’m trying to make sure that they do not slip through. But when you’re spending all your time trying to do that, you’re not being honest or acting the way you normally would in normal situations. It’s this really interesting jug- gling act. Marie recognized that her shifting disclosure decisions—at- tempting to “pull out [her] magic tricks”— demanded significant time and energy and could be difficult to manage on a daily basis. Discussion and Implications Previous research about queer students with disabilities in higher education described students’ decisions to disclose contex- tually, disclose strategically, avoid disclosure, and compare pro- cesses of queer/disability disclosure (Miller et al., 2017a). The present article examined how LGBTQ students with disabilities approached disclosing their queer and disability identities for self and others, signifying identities indirectly, and passing for privi- leged identities. Participants highlighted the ways in which they disclosed particular social identities contextually and managed the perceptions of others at various times and spaces. Students’ rela- tionships to passing and being (in)visibly queer/disabled undoubt- edly affected the way they approached disclosure decisions—and whether they viewed disclosure as a decision to be made at all or a foregone conclusion due to a disability signifier or their gender presentation. Mills (2017) found that students with highly visible disabilities and/or who use assistive devices will be less likely to pass as nondisabled, exemplified by the participant in Henry et al. (2010) who identified as a gay man with a physical disability. In the present study, students noted that even if their identities could temporarily be concealed, their identities often became highly visible at times; for instance, on days Sandy needed to use a service dog on campus or when Dani used assistive technology that revealed her visual disability. Participants implicitly and ex- plicitly challenged the notion that identities must be performed and communicated in consistent ways across contexts. Thus, this work confirms and extends previous research on selective outness (Pat- ton, 2011) and strategic outness (Orne, 2011), concepts exploredThisdocumentiscopyrightedbytheAmericanPsychologicalAssociationoroneofitsalliedpublishers.Thisarticleisintendedsolelyforthepersonaluseoftheindividualuserandisnottobedisseminatedbroadly. 314 MILLER, WYNN, AND WEBB within the context of queer identities that could also be extended to disability disclosure. Further, as we noted at the start of the findings section, students primarily relied upon additive or singular descriptions of identity disclosure (i.e., disclosing a disability or queer identity, but not both simultaneously). This is consistent with previous intersec- tional research concluding that overall, it is “difficult for partici- pants to fully articulate intersectional identities” (Torres et al., 2009, p. 589). Previous research also suggests that students may perform their identities in ways that reflect salience and context (Harper, Wardell, & McGuire, 2011; Miller, 2018; Nicolazzo, 2016a; Stewart, 2009). For example, participants in this study expressed motivation for disclosing their identities as a way of “being there for others”; as such, they highlighted a singular identity which might help to facilitate connection with others, despite personally understanding themselves in a more complex, intersectional way. Embracing a nonintersectional approach to identity expression may also serve as a coping strategy to manage the effects of living with multiple oppressed identities especially when those identities are viewed as oppositional (Miller, 2018). Passing for privileged identities also highlights a significant chal- lenge to participants expressing themselves through an intersec- tional lens. In these instances, the advantages of passing outweigh the benefits of fully expressing one’s identity and support students’ decisions to minimize or deny aspects of themselves. Perhaps a larger issue in students articulating their identities in one dimen- sional or cumulative ways has to do with the theory of intersec- tionality itself. Nash (2008) offered a critical analysis of intersec- tionality and questioned “whether intersectionality actually captures the ways in which subjects experience subjectivity or strategically deploy identity” (p. 11). While interpreting students’ disclosures and nondisclosures through an intersectional lens was not the focus of this article, additional inquiry could explore the relationship between intersectionality as a theory and college stu- dents’ self-descriptions and performances of their identities, which may not necessarily be intersectional. Students named a variety of reasons for and approaches to directly disclosing queer and disability identities that functioned to benefit both themselves and others. Students shared their identities with others to relieve burdens they experienced, build more au- thentic relationships, add visibility to queer and disability causes, and to serve as educators or role models who are “out” to others, among other reasons. Disclosure to benefit oneself often ended up serving a purpose for others who received the disclosure as well. It would be difficult to draw a bright line between disclosure for self and disclosure for others, as disclosure often served both purposes. Because students in this study believed they could, at least temporarily, conceal their queer and/or disability identities, students were faced with constant decisions about whether to disclose, directly or indirectly, a finding echoed in previous research (Klein et al., 2015; Kranke et al., 2013; Shakespeare, 1999). Students commented that disclosing disability and LGBTQ identities in certain contexts could lead to exclusion, harassment, and marginalization. These concerns and fears were often based on students’ prior experiences in which they had experienced such marginalization after their identities be- came visible or known. Overall, students viewed disability disclosure as more risky in university contexts than LGBTQ disclosure. Disclosing disability could be interpreted as a sign of weakness or that one was incapable of academic work (Clair et al., 2005; Matthews & Harrington, 2000). Students may have also felt more pressure to disclose disability in academic con- texts, especially if they used academic accommodations, in which they might not otherwise feel the need to disclose queer identities. In some contexts, students recognized that they only indirectly disclosed identities and preferred not to make more public pronouncements of their identities. While students of- fered a few examples of such indirect disclosures related to sexual orientation or gender identity, these indirect disclosures were most often of disability and mental health. Use of symbols and aids such as medication, canes, service animals, lack of consistent eye contact, or assistive technology could “out” students as disabled and these aids also heightened students’ awareness of others’ perceptions. However, these signifiers also helped to validate that disability and any associated accommo- dations they received were legitimate. These aids often served important functional purposes as well, which helped students navigate campus with a disability. In addition to indirectly disclosing, students recognized that they sometimes passed for less stigmatized identities, either intentionally or unintentionally. Students saw the passing phe- nomenon as a “double-edged sword” that could help them avoid discrimination and social exclusion but that could also reduce their visibility, make it harder to be legible to others who shared their identities, and lead to a continual decision-making process about whether to disclose. Participants described expending emotional labor and, at times, becoming fatigued by continually managing their identities. This complicated relationship to passing is echoed most directly in prior higher education re- search on trans\u0002 students’ identity management experiences and strategies (Catalano, 2015; Nicolazzo, 2016a, 2016b). Beyond higher education, research has also highlighted that the contin- ual decision-making process of whether to disclose LGB iden- tities plays a role in minority stress (Meyer, 2013). Studies have shown that this stress compromises mental and physical health and can lead to diminished self-worth, impaired functioning, and suboptimal behavioral, social, and educational outcomes (Caceres et al., 2017; Kelleher, 2009; Lehavot & Simoni, 2011; Oswalt & Wyatt, 2011). Reducing these identity management strategies to a binary of in the closet/out of the closet would fail to capture the complexity of the students’ lived experiences. Students engaged in an assessment process of new situations, contexts, and relationships to determine how they might enact and express their identities, strategic choices that might be viewed as the use of interpersonal skills (Olney & Brockelman, 2003) and weighing the relative costs and benefits of disclosure (Lasser & Wicker, 2007; Riddell & Weedon, 2014). Rather than seeing themselves as closeted or ashamed when they chose not to disclose, students viewed their decisions as strategic, contextual, and ongoing. However, students also described fatigue associated with continually managing perceptions of stigmatized identities, building upon previous work on disability identity man- agement among college students (Olney & Brockelman, 2003) and LGB identity management (D’haese et al., 2016; Dewaele et al., 2013).ThisdocumentiscopyrightedbytheAmericanPsychologicalAssociationoroneofitsalliedpublishers.Thisarticleisintendedsolelyforthepersonaluseoftheindividualuserandisnottobedisseminatedbroadly. 315THIS REALLY INTERESTING JUGGLING ACT Implications for Practice The findings of this study offer implications for student affairs educators, faculty members, administrators, and students in higher education. Overall, this study emphasizes the need to view stu- dents’ intersectional identity management processes in a complex, multifaceted manner. Single-identity developmental theories may fail to account for students’ nuanced experiences of multiple identities, experiences that might not be shared by any two stu- dents. As participants pointed out, disclosing identities or “coming out” about any identity was an ongoing experience characterized by strategic decisions in multiple environments. To assume that a student had universally disclosed an identity, or never disclosed it, would miss the mark. In addition, students may indirectly signify a queer/disability identity, whether intentionally or unintention- ally, but this does not mean that students would like to directly disclose their identities. Care should be taken not to intentionally or unintentionally “out” students in different contexts, but rather, to follow a student’s lead with respect to identity management and visibility. Several implications relate to the work of campus offices and departments, particularly those offices that interface with students. Professionals should take part in regular training and professional development opportunities related to students’ identities and iden- tity management strategies, and also seek to translate this learning into policy where possible. For example, counseling centers could seek to increase the multicultural competence of counselors on multiple facets of identity and identity intersections in all aspects of service delivery including assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning, and outreach and consultation. Residence life depart- ments that take gender or sex into account in room assignments should consider how student (non)disclosure of gender identities influences the process. Campus departments, particularly those that aim to meet specific needs of queer students and students with disabilities (e.g., disability services offices, LGBTQ resource cen- ters) should carefully evaluate whether they place a premium upon public identity disclosure and which students they might be failing to serve given that stance. These offices might also seek to develop intentional, long-term collaborations focus on various identity intersections. It would be a mistake for faculty and administrators to assume that universal identity disclosure is possible or even desirable for all students. Students shared a variety of reasons— safety, comfort, wellness, mental health, and preservation of rela- tionships and group memberships—that they might not consis- tently disclose an identity. Student choosing not to routinely disclose queer or disability identities should not automatically or categorically be viewed as less mature than their peers who dis- close. Those students who may pass for a more privileged, less stigmatized identity often recognize the benefits and drawbacks of passing and approach the task differently according to context. Such passing may be intentional or unintentional and, again, may serve a variety of purposes. In addition to campus offices and resource centers, the class- room functioned as a particularly fraught and high-stakes site for choosing to disclose disability/queer identities. Several students who participated in this study suggested that faculty members ask students to confidentially share any information they will need to know about students in the first week of classes. This information might include particular identities, gender pronouns in use, and areas where students may need flexibility or support, in addition to the formalized disability accommodation process. Students empha- sized the importance of a confidential outlet to share these con- cerns with faculty members, such as a survey or e-mail message. Limitations and Future Research As an interview-based project, this study only includes the voices of students who decided to participate and to share their identities and experiences with the researchers. Though we inten- tionally defined disability and queer identities broadly in this study, the self-selecting group that ultimately chose to participate in this study primarily included those who felt they could, at least occasionally, conceal their queer/disability identities. Participants in this study primarily regarded these identities as only partially visible or legible in most contexts without a direct disclosure; therefore, those who view their queerness and/or disability as less easily concealed likely experience identity management differently and adopt divergent strategies. The identity management strategies enacted by students who do not routinely disclose queer/disability identities or would not participate in a research study on this topic are not addressed. Students’ identity management strategies related to race, class, religion, and other intersecting identities also de- serve further exploration. Lastly, this study is limited by its exam- ination of students at two predominantly White universities in the South. Students at other types of institutions and in other regional contexts might experience disclosure differently. These limitations suggest opportunities for continued research at the intersections of queer and disability identities. In particular, we suggest that scholars should seek to study the experiences of people whose disabilities and/or queer identities are highly visible or apparent, and how these individuals choose to manage and express their identities. For those with highly visible identities, identity management may be less a matter of choosing to disclose or pass, and might focus more on issues of highlighting or down- playing specific aspects of their identities, or the phenomenon that Yoshino (2007) referred to as covering. Beyond these specific identities, the identity management strategies of students with other intersections of identities warrants exploration, as research on student identities has historically considered only one identity at a time but has begun to shift to a fuller examination of multiple identities. Lastly, while this study includes experiences of partic- ipants related to both sexual orientation (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisex- ual) and gender identity (i.e., trans \u0002, genderqueer, nonbinary), additional inquiry on the specific identity management strategies employed by trans \u0002 participants (including the nine trans \u0002, gender- queer, and nonbinary participants in this study) is needed. Conclusion Growing bodies of research in higher education and student development have considered the identities of LGBTQ students and students with disabilities as distinct groups and some of this research has addressed the identity disclosure decisions of each population. However, few studies have addressed the experiences of queer students with disabilities. This study begins to fill a gap in understanding how students approached disclosure decisions connected to both disability and queer identities. Thirty-one stu- dents at two universities in the southern United States describedThisdocumentiscopyrightedbytheAmericanPsychologicalAssociationoroneofitsalliedpublishers.Thisarticleisintendedsolelyforthepersonaluseoftheindividualuserandisnottobedisseminatedbroadly. 316 MILLER, WYNN, AND WEBB their processes for disclosing queer/disability identities both for themselves and others; disclosing identities indirectly through sig- nifiers; and passing for privileged (cisgender/heterosexual/nondis- abled) identities. The findings presented from this study suggest that higher education faculty members, administrators, and student affairs professionals should adopt a more multifaceted view of students’ identities and their complex identity management pro- cesses. In addition, findings point to the need for additional re- search exploring identity and visibility management strategies at the intersections of multiple identities. References Abes, E. S. (2012).
