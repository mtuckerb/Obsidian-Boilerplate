{"path":"2025/PHI-275 - The Nature of Compassion/Attachments/Pitty's Pathologies Protrayed.pdf","text":"PITY'S PATHOLOGIES PORTRAYED Rousseau and the Limits of Democratic Compassion RICHARD BOYD University of Wisconsin-Madison Jean-Jacques Rousseau is renownedfor defending the pity of the state of nature over and against the vanity, cruelty, and inequalities of civil society. In the standard reading, it is this sentiment of pity, activated by our imagination, that allows for the cultivation of compassion. However, a closer look at the \"pathologies of pity\" in Rousseau's system challenges this idea that pity is a pleasurable sentiment that arises from a recognition of the identity of our natures and leads ulti- mately to communion with ourfellow-creatures. Instead, pity rests inexorably on a sense of dif- ference, is fueled by an aversion to suffering, and is more likely to yield a world of \"reluctant spectators\" than one of simple souls eagerly rushing to the aid of others. Because compassion is unlikely to encourage the moral equality and willful agency requisite to democracy, trying to make compassion central to democratic theory may very well prove counterproductive.

Compas- sion is frequently heralded as one of the foremost accomplishments of mod- ern democracy.

Liberal democracy rightly \"puts cruelty first,\" in the words of Judith Shklar, when it sides with compassidn against a pitiless disregard for humanity.' And yet, ironically, this idea that democracy equals compassion has been advanced more often by democracy's critics than by its defenders. In the midst of his criticisms, Alexis de Tocqueville admitted that in democratic ages men rarely sacrifice themselves for another, but they show a general compassion for all the human race. One never sees them inflict pointless suffering, and they are glad to relieve the sorrows of others when they can do so without much trouble to themselves.2 Treating this \"general compassion\" as a vice, rather than a redeeming virtue of modern democracy, Friedrich Nietzsche diagnosed pity as a kind of demo- cratic \"sickness\" or \"nausea.\"3 Carl Schmitt similarly complained that the excessive \"humanity\" of modern democracies sapped them of the will to uphold the \"friend-and-enemy distinction\" even to the point of obliterating the concept of the political altogether.4 Notwithstanding these and other noteworthy criticisms of democracies as indiscriminately compassionate, paralyzed by their sensitivity to the point of being kind when they should be cruel, and consequently cruel when they should be kind, remarkably few contemporary democratic theorists have actually appealed to compassion.5 As Nancy Hirschmann has observed, \"the concept of sympathy is not a major player in the world of political theory, which is generally more concerned with justice, freedom or rights.\"6 Influen- tial democratic theorists like Jtirgen Habermas, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson, and Benjamin Barber say little about the place of compassion in a democracy, and indeed seem suspicious of the role of affect or emotion in political life more generally.7 Among the few who explicitly make compas- sion central to democratic theory and practice are feminist theorists like Carol Gilligan or Joan Tronto who envision an \"ethic of care\" as an alterna- tive to an overly rationalistic emphasis on legalism or justice.8 And certain \"communitarian\" critics of liberalism seem to call for a more compassionate society, if only by implication, when they fault the liberal individual's alleged indifference to fellow citizens and lack of deeper emotional commitments to public life.9 This disconnect between our intuitive sense that democracies are, or at least ought to be, distinguished by their compassion and the apparent neglect of compassion by democratic theorists proper brings to mind the case of Jean- Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau is widely hailed for his commitments to both compassion and political democracy.'0 However, like so many other para- doxes of Rousseau's political theory, we should be wary of assuming that This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Boyd / ROUSSEAU AND THE LIMITS OF DEMOCRATIC COMPASSION 521 these two values are easily combined with one another. His ambivalent treat- ment of compassion serves as a starting point for this article's two main lines of analysis. The first is to draw attention to the problematic, indeed \"pathologi- cal\" status of pity in Rousseau's system. This essay challenges the dominant scholarly view that pity is a pleasurable sentiment that inclines us to the aid of our fellow man; instead, insofar as pity collapses back into self-preservation, it leads just as easily to aversion and avoidance. Rather than a pathway to the rediscovery of our natural wholeness, pity serves as a dispiriting reminder of the profound dependency of the human condition.\" These ambivalent aspects of pity make it, in Rousseau's view, unsuitable for grounding the democratic political theory he develops in the Social Contract (SC). The second and broader claim is that, following Rousseau's lead, we too should be cautious about trying to incorporate compassion more formally into contemporary democratic theory. If we think of liberal democracy not so much as a set of political institutions circumscribed by the limits of human sympathy, but rather, following George Kateb, as premised on an implicit recognition of moral equality, and in terms of the valorization of will and individual agency, as Richard Flathman has suggested, then Rousseau's idea of compassion comes up short on both counts.2\" Although it is founded on the apprehension of the identity of our natures as fellow-creatures (semblables), even in Rousseau's account pity is inevitably bound up with relational differ- ences that are the very antithesis of natural equality. Trying to make compas- sion central to democratic theory reifies the very distinctions it aims to over- come, inviting what William Connolly describes as the dialectical problem of \"identity/difference\" whereby any virtue creates a category of \"otherness\" or \"difference\" in those who do not possess it.'\" Rousseau's treatment of com- passion also deepens the tension between human beings as \"actors\"-in the dual sense of playing a role and of agents engaging in conduct-and those who passively experience the emotion of pity only as \"reluctant spectators.\" In all these respects, Rousseau's treatment of pity underscores the moral discrepancies between compassion-conjured up by the sentiments of the heart-and liberal democratic demands for equal treatment and willful agency. II. THE \"NATURAL\" GROUNDING OF PITY In the Second Discourse (SD), Rousseau distinguishes two faculties \"anterior to reason\" that are present in natural man: self-preservation (amour de soi) and pity (pitid), the latter of which \"inspires in us a natural repugnance to see any sensitive being suffer, principally our fellow-men\" (SD, p. 95).14 This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 522 POLITICAL THEORY / August 2004 These faculties are presocial; they entail no \"necessity of introducing that [faculty] of sociability.\" Important for Rousseau's broader argument is the fact that these faculties are negative, in the sense that they are insufficient to incline us toward the society of others. Although they presumably imply \"duties\" toward other \"sensitive beings,\" including animals, the sum total of these is simply to refrain from \"harming\" or \"mistreating\" another (SD, p. 96). This \"inner impulse of commiseration\" is dictated by our common \"sensi- tivity,\" rather than by the belated lessons of reason. We share this sensitivity with animals, which entitles them to be brought within the province of natu- ral right. Nonetheless, \"being devoid of intellect and freedom, they [animals] cannot recognize this law\" (SD, p. 96). What begins as an otherwise flattering contrast between men and beasts gives way to a deeper problem: for although all individuals possess this immanent sensitivity inclining them toward com- passion, they, like beasts, may be incapable of attending to its dictates until they possess those perfected faculties of \"intellect and freedom\" that Rous- seau denies natural man. In this rendering, pity and compassion toward oth- ers can bear fruit only once the process of human development has begun. We must first acquire the moral liberty, self-consciousness, imagination, and rea- son Rousseau grudgingly acknowledges as necessary for us to rise above the level of a \"stupid, limited animal\" and to become \"an intelligent being and a man\" (SC, I, viii, p. 57). Being able to access our natural sensitivity presumes that we have already become moral beings, possessing souls, free will, moral agency, and presum- ably also some elementary faculty of reason (SD, p. 114). In order to feel compassion we must already have become moral agents. Yet as we discover later in Rousseau's treatment, it is this very process of development itself, and especially our acquisition of a highly cultivated faculty of abstract ratiocina- tion, that renders us incapable of any longer attending to this sensible voice within our nature. With reason come vanity, self-consciousness, and cruelty (SD, \"Note O,\" p. 222). Rousseau's treatment leads us almost immediately to doubt that modem society and its accomplishments will in any way allow us to make good on that faculty of pity for other sensible beings. Rousseau observes, albeit in the form of a conditional objection, that com- miseration is \"obscure and strong in savage man, developed but feeble in civil man\" (SD, p. 132). At least the modem condition allows the potential for, if not the likelihood of, this more \"developed\" social conscience. But under what conditions might this otherwise \"feeble\" voice of pity become accessi- ble to us? As we see in both the Second Discourse and Emile (E), whether or not we heed this voice of sympathy hinges on our ability to recognize and \"identify\" with another. Pity hinges on the problem of recognition or what Rousseau himself calls \"identification\" (SD, p. 132). Yet the difficulty of rec- This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Boyd / ROUSSEAU AND THE LIMITS OF DEMOCRATIC COMPASSION 523 ognizing something of one's self in another is exacerbated by the growing inequalities of civil society. Because \"commiseration will be all the more energetic as the observing animal identifies himself more intimately with the suffering animal,\" it follows that \"this identification must have been infi- nitely closer in the state of nature than in the state of reasoning\" (SD, p. 132). Natural sensitivity and other common features of natural equality are over- whelmed by manifold conventional differences, to the point where individu- als are so different from one another that they can scarcely recognize any common humanity beneath the layers of acculturation. This is a lamentable consequence of the growth of \"reason,\" which \"engenders vanity\" and \"turns man back upon himself,\" preventing him from \"identifying himself with the man who is being assassinated\" (SD, p. 132). But if reason bears some responsibility for robbing us of the more elemen- tal ability to identify with another by apprehending the natural sensibility we all share, it also supplies us with the surrogate faculty of imagination. As Rousseau distinguishes, \"Imagination, which causes so much havoc among us, does not speak to savage hearts\" (SD, p. 135). Only once we have gone some distance along the philosophical anthropology of mankind can we identify with another by imagining ourselves in his position, so as to commis- erate with his pain or rejoice in his happiness. Although the details of this \"identification\" are blurry, Rousseau does suggest an important difference between the \"obscure and strong\" sentiment of natural pity and that compas- sion that is \"developed but feeble\" in civilized man.15 Presumably, the natural pity of the state of nature depended only' on our ability to hear \"its gentle voice\" wholly within ourselves (SD, p. 133). How- ever, what Rousseau describes as compassion is no longer a sentiment con- tingent on our natural wholeness and self-sufficiency, requiring neither wis- dom nor self-knowledge. Instead, it is a force that, \"moderating in each individual the activity of love of one's self,\" demands that we look outward and consciously attempt to see the world through the eyes of another (SD, p. 133). Imagination apparently \"moderates\" the influence or \"activity\" of self-love neither by conquering or repressing it, nor by restoring our natural wholeness, as we might imagine, but by drawing us further out of ourselves: To become sensitive and pitying, the child must know that there are beings like him who suffer what he has suffered, who feel the pains he has felt . .. how do we let ourselves be moved by pity if not by transporting ourselves outside of ourselves and identifying with the suffering animal, by leaving... our own being to take on his being.

Perhaps this is why, as Clifford Orwin has suggested, Rousseau con- ceives of the virtue of compassion as being so uniquely suited to bourgeois society.'\" Bourgeois society is characterized both by conspicuous human suf- fering and an inability to see ourselves without mediated comparisons with others. In order to commiserate, we must transcend our self and the illusion of self-sufficiency by putting our self in another's place, seeing the world through her eyes rather than our own. Rousseau calls this process \"identifica- tion.\" Its etymological connection to \"identity\" merits comment. To identify with another is to discover some common identity among like or fellow-crea- tures-semblables. In contrast to many contemporary understandings of identity that make this term synonymous with subjectivity, particularity, or difference, for Rousseau, \"identite\"' refers to those common equivalencies that define us all as selves: \"similarity\" or \"equality\" seem better synonyms. We must \"identify\" with another by looking beyond difference and locating something \"identical\" or equivalent to which we can relate. What this \"iden- tity of our natures\" might consist of and the difficulties of discovering it are significant (E, IV, p. 221). For ultimately what the imagination reveals to us is our condition of mutual dependency: \"It is our common miseries which turn our hearts to humanity.... If our common needs unite us by interest, our com- mon miseries unite us by affection.\" The \"sentiment of their pains\" affords us a far better access to what we share in common with others than the exclusiv- ity of their particular successes and joys, which yield \"less love than envy\" (E, IV, p. 221). Ironically, the constancy of pain and human suffering is the best reminder of our common humanity.8 III. THE \"SWEETNESS\" OF PITY: VOYEURISM AND SPECTATORSHIP One of the many paradoxes of Rousseau's account of pity and compassion is that these feelings require real human beings to suffer. Only by exposure to the actual presence of \"human calamities\" and the \"sad picture of suffering humanity\" do we develop the faculty of compassion (E, IV, pp. 222, 224). Still, it is striking how little is said about how this commiseration may assuage the suffering of the afflicted in some, small way.19 Instead Rousseau This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Boyd / ROUSSEAU AND THE LIMITS OF DEMOCRATIC COMPASSION 525 insists that the compassionate presumably acquire something even more valuable. For the very possibility of tasting the \"sweetest\" human sentiments requires that some should suffer in order for others to experience happiness: \"Pity is sweet because, in putting ourselves in the place of the one who suf- fers, we nevertheless feel the pleasure of not suffering as he does\" (E, IV, p. 221). Maybe the best evidence of this voyeuristic, \"pleasurable\" aspect of com- passion is Rousseau's stipulation that the sad spectacle of human suffering ought to be used, but not overused, as an object lesson in Emile's education, lest he become callous by an early overexposure to human misery. Rousseau raises as a possibility, and then summarily dismisses, the life of a Mother Theresa, who rushes from hospital to hospital and from sickroom to sick- room, as too likely to obscure human sentimentality: \"The object is not to make your pupil a male nurse or a brother of charity, not to afflict his sight with constant objects of pain and suffering. ... He must be touched and not hardened by the sight of human miseries\" (E, IV, p. 231). This is again to sug- gest that human suffering should be attended to not so much out of a desire to relieve those who suffer but instead for the development of Emile's charac- ter.20 Describing human suffering as an \"object,\" \"sight,\" \"scene,\" \"impres- sion,\" \"picture,\" or \"spectacle\" reveals it to be, like nature, an object to be por- trayed, instrumentalized, and manipulated in the interest of human conve- nience (E, IV, pp. 222, 226, 227, 230-32). Suffering is neither simply inevitable nor lamentable. It exists for the sake of sensitive spectators like Emile to develop their highest human faculties.21 In fairness, Rousseau does appear to be genuinely moved by the condition of suffering humanity. That he should be so intent to define cruelty as the pre- eminent human vice testifies to his sentimentality and humanism. But in the end, human suffering becomes a kind of \"spectacle\" to be controlled, showcased, and manipulated for the edification of the few. \"Let him see, let him feel the human calamities,\" Rousseau admonishes (E, IV, p. 224). Like the syphillitics whose suffering becomes an object lesson for the prodigal son, suffering humanity exists for the sake of Emile's education and eventual happiness, and not vice versa (E, IV, p. 231). All this seems bad enough. But Rousseau goes further still: whatever limited prospects we retain for human happiness can be attained only when, after immersing one's self in another's misery, we return to our selves and experience sublime pleasure in the real- ization that we do not share the other's misfortunes. Only this voyeuristic thrill can possibly make us happy with our lot. The resultant \"sweet\" sensa- tion of pleasure, according to Rousseau, is the negative, paradoxical version of that \"frail happiness\" that consists only in the absence of suffering (E, IV, This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 526 POLITICAL THEORY / August 2004 p. 221; SD, p. 132). Yet its very \"sweetness\" appears to be parasitical on the suffering of another, just as the contentment and status of the master rests on the subordination of the slave. Tragically, Emile can find the key to happiness only in viewing (but not acting upon) the sufferings of others. In part, this is the unfortunate corollary to Rousseau's pessimism: living in civil society ensures that we cannot regard the good fortune of others without falling prey to the vices of vanity, envy, and jealousy (E, IV, pp. 228-30). Seeing another happy appeals to the lowest forms of our imagination. Yet the perversity of Rousseau's alternative is that while denying the vicarious pleasures of the friend or lover, who experience pleasure by partaking in the happiness of others, Rousseau's compassionate soul becomes a kind of moral voyeur. After imagining himself in the place of suffering humanity he achieves the heady rush of \"sweet\" relational happi- ness that comes upon returning to his own superior condition. IV PITY AND PERFORMANCE: COMPASSION AND THE RELUCTANT SPECTATOR Rousseau repeatedly emphasizes the visual aspects of suffering humanity -the salutary effects of witnessing it, if not of acting upon it. \"One must,\" he notes, \"have seen corpses to feel the agonies of the dying\" (E, IV, p. 226). At first glance, the theater promises an alternative to this view of human suffer- ing as a slaughter bench of history whose ultimate goal is to foster perfection and happiness in the sentimental few. In the theater, at the very least, the object lesson of human suffering may stoke the fires of human imagination without requiring real persons to suffer: \"it is there that they go to forget their friends, neighbors and relations in order to concern themselves with fables in order to cry for the misfortunes of the dead, or to laugh at the expense of the living\" (Politics and the Arts: Letter to M. D 'Alembert on the Theatre [LDT], p. 17). But this quote is also suggestive of how the theater may function as an escape from everyday moral obligations. Rather than protecting an otherwise virtuous society from the corrupting influence of the arts, as Rousseau is often read, his criticism of the theater may also be taken as a further indict- ment of the lack of compassion in bourgeois society.22 In bourgeois society, after all, we are all actors and spectators.23 From the elementary songs and dances in the Second Discourse that give rise to vanity and affectation we are soon confronted by a world where \"to be and to seem to be became two alto- gether different things\" (SD, pp. 149, 155).

We are constantly engaged in performance and dissimulation. As a microcosm of this imaginary world of performance, the theater epitomizes this alien, bourgeois condition of \"seeming\" rather than \"being.\" The theater, in the words of David Marshall, \"teaches people how to become spectators, how to act like spectators.\"24 Despite these apparent continuities between the world of spectacle and the politics of the ordinary, the force of Rousseau's criticism rests on stressing the discrepancy between our moral position as spectators and our status as political actors in everyday life. Rousseau disparages the false sensitivity of average theatergoers who are moved by pity for those who suffer at the hands of a fictional tyrant while they themselves would \"aggravate his enemy's tor- ments even more\" if allowed for even a moment to take the tyrant's place. Like \"bloodthirsty Sulla, so sensitive to evils he had not caused\" (and hence presumably indifferent to those he has?) they are moved by a love of human- ity in the abstract that they are incapable of conjuring up in the particular (SD, p. 131). Rousseau's examples of the tyrants Sulla and Alexander of Pherae sug- gest, optimistically, that even the hardest of hearts-literal tyrants-can still be moved by human suffering. And yet the very extremity of Rousseau's examples goes to suggest an even more damning criticism of the quotidian. The fact that we so easily cry at this imaginary spectacle implies a criticism of the sentimentality of modern civilization, where the cultivation of the fine arts takes the place of the more authentic natural sentiments of pity or com- passion. In our everyday conduct we are untroubled by our own propensity for cruelty. This gross disparity between the love of humanity in the abstract and callousness toward real particular beings in the here-and-now is hardly confined to the likes of Sulla and Alexander of Pherae. Modern compassion may prove, as Rousseau suggested it would, simultaneously \"developed\" but \"feeble.\" As moral spectators we unavoidably feel pity when we witness suf- fering, but in everyday life we are unlikely to act upon these feelings.25 Even if we ignore Rousseau's complaints about these sentiments as effeminate or corrosive of civic virtue, this sentimentalism invites problems on its own terms.26 No doubt the ease with which we identify with the tortured character, and readily imagine ourselves in her place, is due in part to the romance of the theater. When performed in the theater the suffering of humanity becomes dramatic, romantic, and sympathetic. By way of contrast, Rousseau himself admits that the suffering of the mass of humanity is ugly (E, IV, p. 225). One danger of blurring the line between the pefformative and personal dimensions of suffering is that misery comes to be seen as the stuff of fiction. Suffering humanity becomes an abstract, imaginary categoryiden- tified with charismatic actors rather than the particular individuals we know This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 528 POLITICAL THEORY / August 2004 in everyday life. Insofar as the suffering of real human beings is never so glamorous, noble, or epic as its romanticized theatrical counterpart, we may become less able than ever to sympathize with it. \"The continual emotion which is felt in the theatre excites us, enervates us, enfeebles us, and makes us less able to resist our passions. And the sterile interest taken in virtue serves only to satisfy our vanity without obliging us to practice it\" (LDT, p. 57). The pathologies of this kind of escapism are easy to anticipate. In everyday life we are \"actors\" in the sense that we pretend and dissimulate, but merely pas- sive \"spectators\" when the practice of compassion is actually called for. We lack agency and will. Worse still: like those animals that are reluctant to pass near a dead member of their species, real suffering yields a kind of aversion. We may flock to the theaters to view the heady rush of human suffering, trag- edy, and commiseration, but in our own lives, like Rousseau's animals, we avert our eyes and cross to the other side of the street. Leaving the theater we ignore the homeless outside the door. V PITY AS AVERSION AND AVOIDANCE Rousseau's point hinges on the moral contradiction between our delight in witnessing suffering in the theater and our revulsion when confronted by it in reality. And yet this dissonance itself presupposes two mutually exclusive accounts of the moral psychology of pity. There is on the one hand Rous- seau's description of compassion as being the \"sweetest of sentiments.\"27 We feel an undeniable, vicarious pleasure in imagining our self in the position of another who suffers and then returning to our own more enviable position. And yet this notion of compassion as being a pleasurable sensation-one that persons might selfishly seek out-stands in stark contrast with the account of pity to which we have just alluded. Pity, in this other view, is among the most unpleasant of sentiments insofar as it reminds us that we, too, might suffer or even perish. The issue is not whether we are more or less capable of attending to the natural voice of compassion in modern society; rather, it is the sub- stance of what those sentiments suggest to us that may prove most troubling of all.28 Rousseau begins his discussion of natural pity on a curious note by setting aside one of the most conspicuous examples of sympathy, \"Without speaking of the tenderness of mothers for their young, and of the perils they must brave in order to guard them,\" only to posit the more ambiguous example of the aversive behavior of feral animals (SD, p. 130). Could his implicit rejection of the analogy between pity and maternal affection be because to label this sentiment \"pity\" would ask too much of pity, suggesting the very fact that This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Boyd / ROUSSEAU AND THE LIMITS OF DEMOCRATIC COMPASSION 529 Rousseau aims to deny, namely, the existence of some kind of natural socia- bility? Or because, in what becomes Rousseau's ironically Hobbesian world- view, the care a mother lavishes upon her child is not in fact an act of natural sympathy at all, but simply the biological necessity of dispensing milk belat- edly sentimentalized out of habit or convenience (SD, p. 121, cf. pp. 108-9, 142, 146-48, 191-92n.)?29 Rousseau's subsequent observations about \"the daily repugnance of horses to trample a living body underfoot\" or the \"uneasiness\" of an animal to \"pass near a dead animal of its species\" hardly yield a society of simple souls eagerly rushing to the aid of others. Instead they are suggestive of the mecha- nisms of aversion or avoidance (SD, p. 130). Connecting pity with the lowing of animals in the presence of death does more than just highlight the prob- lems of a modern society where pity has been lost or corrupted. The deeper and more troubling suggestion is that aversion and avoidance may be rooted in the elemental sentiment of pity itself: [Emile] will begin to have gut reactions at the sounds of complaints and cries, the sight of blood flowing will make him avert his eyes; the convulsions of a dying animal will cause him an ineffable distress before he knows whence come these new movements within him. (E, IV, p. 222) This uneasiness when confronted by signs of our own vulnerability is enough to make us want to shun the suffering altogether. Rousseau's exam- ples of feral animals and the lowing of cattle entering the stockyards stress that pity has less to do with a compassionate concern for the welfare of others than with the even more elemental sentiment of self-preservation.3\" Rather than pity successfully \"moderating\" or regulating the \"activity\" of our \"self- love,\" as Rousseau suggests, his examples reinforce the notion that pity only collapses back into this most elemental Hobbesian faculty of self-preserva- tion. Moderating the \"activity\" of our self-regard is different from extin- guishing that self-regard altogether. Whatever \"pity\" these animals feel is not for other dead or injured animals, but stems from the recognition of a similar, and indeed \"inevitable,\" mortality in themselves (E, IV, pp. 226-27).\"3 As Derrida notes, We neither can nor should feel the pain of others immediately and absolutely, for such an interiorization or identification would be dangerous and destructive. That is why the imagination, the reflection, and the judgment that arouse pity also limit its power and hold the suffering of the other at a certain distance.32 Looking more closely at Rousseau's invocation of pity explodes the care- ful theoretical distance he seeks to maintain between solicitude for others, or This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 530 POLITICAL THEORY / August 2004 \"pity,\" and self-regard, or \"amour de soi.\"\"33 Incapable of imagining or fearing death in the abstract, animals can nonetheless sense their mortality when con- fronted by its immediate presence (SD, p. 130). Natural man would retreat in fear at the least prospect of suffering harm rather than risk the dangers of communing with other sensible beings (SD, pp. 107, 129). Far from a primor- dial dose of natural sociability, the emotion of pity makes Rousseau's natural beings less inclined toward society than even Hobbes's emphasis on man's desire for fame and recognition, which may, after all, prove the strongest psy- chological impetus of all for individuals to seek the company of others and depart the Hobbesian state of nature.34 Ironically, then, it is by making his nat- ural psychology more purely Hobbesian even than Hobbes that Rousseau differentiates his natural condition from a state of war.35 Similarly, although pity \"will dissuade every robust savage from robbing a weak child or an infirm old man of his hard-earned subsistence,\" this is only \"if\" or \"so long as,\" \"he himself hopes to be able to find his own elsewhere\" (SD, p. 133). This statement is proscriptive or negative (notice: this is not the same as the positive disposition \"which carries us without reflection to the aid of those we see suffering\") as well as conditional. Whatever small mea- sure of self-restraint is imposed by pity (\"Do what is good for you with as lit- tle harm as possible to others\") remains hostage to conditions of scarcity and to subjective judgments about the dangers of this forbearance to one's own self-preservation. And yet by depriving natural man of the faculties of reason and judgment that Hobbes and Locke allowed him, Rousseau seems to call into question just how substantial are the kinds of mercy that pity might yield. Ultimately, pity does not so much \"moderate\" self-love as deepen and rein- force the natural self-regard that leads us to avoid danger, pain, or suffering in ourselves and in others.36 So the very same pity Rousseau depends upon to dissuade natural man from unnecessarily harming another also discourages him from willfully intervening on behalf of another suffering being. This permeable line between natural sensitivity and self-regard is further blurred in Rousseau's example of the prisoner-spectator. Does Mandeville's prisoner suffer because of the intrinsic horror of \"a wild beast tearing a child from his mother's breast, breaking his weak limbs in its murderous teeth, and ripping apart the palpitating entrails of this child\" in the street beneath his cell (SD, p. 131)? Or rather does his \"horrible agitation\" stem from the fact that, being imprisoned, he has no place to turn and hence cannot avert his gaze? It is significant that Rousseau's presentation of this \"pathetic image\" actually serves to redirect our own sympathy away from the sufferings of the child and mother and toward the prisoner-witness. We are asked to consider \"What anguish must he suffer,\" when, being confined, \"this witness\" is forced to This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Boyd / ROUSSEAU AND THE LIMITS OF DEMOCRATIC COMPASSION 531 watch the horrible spectacle unfolding beneath him \"in which he takes no personal interest\" (SD, p. 131, emphasis added). Rousseau deliberately chooses the example of a prisoner to illustrate the \"force of natural pity,\" which even the \"most depraved morals still have diffi- culty destroying\": his point is strongest in the case of one who has already committed some heinous act against other sensible beings (SD, p. 131). Even criminals feel an elemental connection with human suffering. Notice, how- ever, that the more horrific the spectacle of suffering, the more our sympathy comes to rest with the criminal-witness. Indeed the fact of having suffered sufficiently may even be enough to transform the criminal himself into an object of our pity. At least this was the claim of Adolph Eichmann, for whom the alleged necessity of committing unspeakable atrocities was enough to ground an appeal for compassion.37 The case of the pitiable criminal shows the ease with which we transfer the object of our pity from the actual victim to at least a potential victimizer. What horrors have I witnessed, how painful it was for me to perform such atrocities, how much suffering have I seen and caused: thus, feel pity for me. The victimizer may usurp the agonistic dimen- sions of pity so as to make himself the victim. One of the liabilities of pity as a stand-in for natural right, and of compassion in turn as a surrogate forjustice, is its labile quality.38 Natural compassion seems unable to draw firm and con- vincing lines between right and wrong. It treats all humans as equally piti- able, or, at best, dispenses compassion based on a relative hierarchy of human suffering that blurs the line between criminals and victims.39 There is something nettling about pity's potential for limitless compas- sion, even for criminals like Eichmann. But from the point of view of demo- cratic equality, compassion's indiscriminacy may be less of an issue than its tendency to discriminate. In real life some are more sympathetic than others, after all. For all of his self-pitying, Eichmann was unlikely to garner much compassion, whereas Julien Sorel, the sensitive and dashing young protago- nist of Stendahl's novel Red and Black, would likely have been acquitted of his crime had the public of Besanqon been called upon to judge him.40 Lis- tening to our hearts (rather than legalism or the more abstract reasoning of our minds) may be an unreliable guide to determining who truly deserves our sympathy. If, as I have suggested above, democracy presupposes equal treat- ment, then the notion that we must somehow look to the heart and our emo- tions in lieu of more abstract standards of justice seems misguided. However rigid and punitive its criteria for distinguishing between the categories of those deserving of our compassion and those others to whom we must steel ourselves to be unkind, the case of \"compassionate conservatism\" has per- haps the singular redeeming virtue of warning us that just as compassion ought not to discriminate, neither can it be wholly indiscriminate.

At its best, pity may awaken our natural repugnance to seeing human misery. But we have seen that this need not incline us to do anything much about remedying it. Avoidance proves the unfortunate side effect even of the refined modern compassion grounded in pity that Rousseau elsewhere praises. In his Reveries (RSW), he tells of his initial delight in giving alms to a lame, homeless child he regularly passed on his walks. And yet after time \"this pleasure, having gradually become a habit, was inextricably transformed into a kind of duty\" that Rousseau finds oner- ous and takes special pains to avoid by changing his usual route (RSW, p. 74). So long as the act of compassion involves only the heart it yields the sweetest of pleasures. Once transformed into duty by habituation, as Rousseau alleges it must inevitably be, it quickly loses its charm and becomes burdensome: \"Constraint, though in harmony with my desire, suffices to annihilate it and to change it into repugnance, even into aversion, as soon as it functions too strongly\" (RSW, p. 77). Rousseau alludes to the special, permanent relationship that develops between benefactor and sufferer. Among the \"natural effects of the rela- tionship\" are that a single, heartfelt act of kindness engenders further obli- gations. Knowing this full well, however, Rousseau admits that he has often \"abstained from a good action I had the desire and the power to do, frightened of the subjection I would submit myself to afterward if I yielded to it without reflection\" (RSW, p. 78). This suggests all sorts of things about obligation and dependency. One of the reasons Rousseau wishes to cultivate pity in Emile is to make him aware of his dependence on others. Imagination yields the rec- ognition that no single being is self-sufficient. Against all his best intentions Rousseau's portrayal of this dependency leads ineluctably toward a conclu- sion he adamantly denies: because all alike experience misery and misfor- tune, to be human is by definition to be dependent upon others. Looking beyond the mirage of human autonomy suggested by the liberal fiction of the rights-bearing individual, or indeed the Rousseauian rhetoric of the nobility of savage freedom, Rousseau's individual, rightly thinking, arrives at an almost Christian recognition of his natural indebtedness and the burdens of the human condition. Pity is, as Rousseau observes, a \"disposition that is appropriate to beings as weak and as subject to as many ills as we are\" (SD, p. 130). Still, being aware of one's hypothetical condition of dependency, like Emile, is very different than actually living up to the reciprocal obligations this would apparently impose upon us. Instead, dependency and obligation are moral duties to be fled simply because they are duties. Our lamentable condition of natural and conventional dependency can hardly be improved- This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Boyd / ROUSSEAU AND THE LIMITS OF DEMOCRATIC COMPASSION 533 and is in fact only deepened-when we engender further obligations by help- ing others. Rousseau's criticism of the dialectic of compassion and dependency strikes familiar, contemporary chords. First, in our role as benefactors we should resist the tug of our heart and withhold compassion because it subjects us to additional, unwanted obligations in the future: whether it is jumping in to stop a crime or only phoning the police, don't get involved lest you become further entangled. And second, the aspiration to eliminate dependency in oth- ers provides a convenient justification for denying those who seek our help. Better that we do the hard thing and refuse them now lest we render them dependent on us in the future.41 The awful paradox is that a life in which we studiously strive for autonomy and avoid forging dependencies-both for ourselves and in others-seems fully compatible with Rousseau's account of pity. More than just illustrations of his own misanthropy, Rousseau's discus- sion here underscores an important point about the moral theory of compas- sion. In order for compassion to have any moral significance, it must be heart- felt. We must actually feel compassion. Otherwise, one is simply being forced to perform actions that she experiences as onerous and alien. And yet if a kind action is done only because it is expected, or in the last resort, com- pelled by Good Samaritan laws, how can one expect anything other than that it will be resented? Rousseau's discussion would seem to reveal both the vir- tues and vices of compassion. Compassion is admirable in that it transcends our ordinary rationalistic concerns with justice, statistics, or even utilitarian consequences. Getting to know just one family on welfare may do more to stir us than volumes full of poverty statistics. This explains why it is often hard to swallow the more abstract notion that charity to others around the world may have more salutary consequences than helping those we know and see in our own nation or community. And yet if compassion is to be dispensed only on a sentimental whim, or worse yet, withheld for fear of engendering further obligations and dependencies, it loses whatever power it might have as a source of democratic community.42 If for whatever reason our heart does- n't move us, we may either fail to act, like Rousseau, or act only out of resent- ment for being required to play a role or honor an obligation we have not imposed upon ourselves. VI. PITY'S PLACE IN THE DEMOCRATIC POLITY Imagining ourselves in the position of another creates challenges for dif- ferent groups. For the lower classes this imaginary flight of fancy is easier.

It is the wife of the fishmonger who rushes first into the crowd to stop an act of violence (SD, p. 132). However, the situation of the rich is categorically different. They risk becoming callous precisely because they cannot identify with the masses of humanity: Why are kings without pity for their subjects? Because they count on never being mere men. Why are the rich so hard toward the poor? It is because they have no fear of becom- ing poor. Why does the nobility have so great a contempt for the people? It is because a noble will never be a commoner. (E, IV, p. 224) Only by a colossal leap of the imagination can the rich recognize anything of themselves in the poor, downtrodden, and oppressed. Rousseau focuses mainly on the barriers to compassion between different social classes, but the problem of identity and difference is closely related. Among those conventional differences impressed upon the modem self are religious, ethnic, and occupational differences arising from the pluralism of the modem world. Insofar as we are socially constituted as Christians, Jews, or Muslims, as Serbs, Croats, or Bosnians, we are that much less able to imagine ourselves in the position of another. We are consequentl'y that much more likely to lose touch with the gentle voice of compassion. This fixation on difference explains not only why we are so often incapable of mustering what William Connolly has called a \"generous\" \"ethos of engagement\" across differences, but also why difference so often gives way to callowness, cruelty, and even atrocities.43 In his Social Contract, Rousseau takes a strong stand against difference. He criticizes religious diversity and those partial societies that limit the politi- cal community to something less than the harmonious, homogenous whole of an idealized Sparta or Geneva. Difference and particular identities limit the possibilities of political community, and reckoning up the \"sum of the dif- ferences\" gradually necessitates compromise on ever less specific and more general laws (SC, II, 1, p. 59; II, 3, p. 61). Yet what we have seen so far would suggest that Rousseau's bias against particular differences has far less to do with his advocacy of the moral values of citizenship or political community than with his sense of how otherness and difference foreclose compassion and commiseration between private individuals. Among the foremost values of political community is the fact that it increases the likelihood of compas- sion between citizens by making it more difficult to be cruel to those with whom we share so much. Conversely, to the degree that our identity with oth- ers is obscured, it becomes that much easier to forget that others deserve our This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Boyd / ROUSSEAU AND THE LIMITS OF DEMOCRATIC COMPASSION 535 consideration as fellow sensible beings. Judith Shklar has aptly noted that once any recognition of the identity of our natures has been obscured, cruelty cannot be far behind.44 But thinking about the kinds of differences that usually evoke pity raises fundamental questions about whether pity can ever take place simply by rec- ognizing the identity of our common natures. Instead, as Connolly has sug- gested, doesn't pity (ostensibly grounded in identitd) inevitably entail some reference to difference?45 Colored by self-consciousness and invidious com- parisons with the other, modern pity can assume many forms. Compassion may thinly disguise condescension. These poor suffering souls deserve our pity because we are stronger, more intelligent, wealthier, or more fortunate than they. Even at its best, this bond of commiseration rests upon the very sorts of relational differences Rousseau is concerned to extirpate. As Rousseau wonders, \"what are generosity, clemency, humanity, if not pity applied to the weak, to the guilty, or to the human species in general\" (SD, p. 131)? Here at long last are examples of the modern age's ability to marshal the sentiment of pity toward concrete, positive ends. Yet it is note- worthy that Rousseau raises this as a rhetorical, perhaps even purposefully ironic question that he is reluctant to answer in the affirmative. Are these accomplishments of modern compassion really the \"developed\" and general- ized versions of the elemental faculty of pity that remains \"obscure\" in sav- age man? And in what respect is their \"developed\" status in civil society com- patible with his complaints about their alleged \"feebleness\"? Rousseau's categories apply not to concrete, particular individuals qua individuals but instead as members of abstract groups. In this formulation, we pity the \"weak\" not as equal, fellow sensible beings but because of their condition of weakness, which Rousseau elsewhere insists is an unnatural dif- ference. The status of \"guilt\"-with its conventional notions of criminality or moral approbation and disapprobation-is what evokes our sympathy. And even in the case of the universal love for all of \"humanity,\" compassion is awarded based on the recipient's membership in the highly abstract category of \"humanity,\" rather than by her particular, concrete presence as a fellow sentient being.46 Such abstract and conventional categories as Rousseau invokes are irrelevant to and beyond the conceptualization of natural man. Pity may also be colored by vanity and invidious comparisons. The strong pity the weak because they are beneath them. The guilty deserve clemency from the guiltless because they are in some respect their moral superiors. Thinking long and hard about these relational comparisons-and the secret feelings of self-importance and righteousness they often disguise-reveals just how much they color and inspire much of what passes for pity in modern society.47 Pity is either so universal as to be based on membership in abstract This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 536 POLITICAL THEORY / August 2004 categories that transcend one's individual sensibility, or so particular as to lay emphasis on the very relational differences it is supposed to overcome. It seems doomed either to obfuscate, or to fixate upon, the identity of the suf- ferer. In the words of Connolly, \"Identity, then, is always connected to a series of differences that help it to be what it is.\"48 The central question both for Rousseau and modern democracy is whether we can ever feel compassion for another without somehow invoking our self and its standing relative to the condition of another. Surely we must first experience the other as a self similarly endowed with sensibility; \"commiser- ation will be all the more energetic as the observing animal identifies himself more intimately with the suffering animal\" (SD, p. 132). We feel no pity for rocks or trees.49 Yet the self for Rousseau is pure potentiality, susceptible by its \"perfectibility\" to the diverse influences of environment, convention, and social status. What happens, then, when the selves who confront one another are no longer the simple, sensible beings who accidentally crossed paths in the state of nature, but instead are subsequently and indelibly stamped by conventional differences like strong, weak, rich, poor, honorable, and mean? Between the denatured selves of civil society whom Rousseau describes as having attained \"self-consciousness,\" the act of recognition is twofold. Even if the initial recognition of another reveals the universal sympathy we all share as sensible beings, the next and inevitable recognition must be that everything else that constitutes that self is conventional, particular, and alien.50 VII. CONCLUSION: PITY AS A POLITICAL IDEAL? This leaves us with two apparently paradoxical insights into the political role of compassion. Like today's proponents of greater \"community\" or an \"ethic of care,\" Rousseau wants to encourage a more compassionate society. So far, so good. And yet his treatment of pity also suggests why trying to incorporate compassion more explicitly into democratic theory is such a problematic way of accomplishing this.\"' We have seen the unlikelihood, if not impossibility, of pity's recognition of similarity transcending the con- comitant recognition of difference it seemingly entails. But assuming that we are somehow capable of this kind of recognition, it hardly seems an adequate basis for thick and meaningful obligations, as contemporary advocates of an ethic of care or others more amenable to community might insist.52 Even if we are able to transcend the manifold conventional differences that constitute modern selves-an act of the imagination that Rousseau him- self admits grows more doubtful by the day-the underlying commonality This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Boyd / ROUSSEAU AND THE LIMITS OF DEMOCRATIC COMPASSION 537 that we discover is of such an elementary character that we share it even with beasts. Recognizing our self in another yields only the most basic animal fact, namely, that she, like us, feels pain and suffers. Recognition of what we share in common leads to the dispiriting reduction of the distinctively human to the merely biological: \"All are born naked and poor; all are subject to the miseries of life, to sorrows, ills, needs, and pains of every kind.\" More pessi- mistic still: Rousseau confesses \"what best characterizes humanity\" is the Hobbesian recognition that \"all are condemned to death\" (E, IV, p. 222). This hardly illuminates robust, inspiring, and uniquely human possibilities. It dictates only the thinnest and most minimal of obligations. Less even than the Christian admonition to do good unto others, recognition among Rousseauian selves says only that we should \"Do what is good for you with the least possible harm to others.\" When in doubt, do no evil. Rousseau asks rhetorically whether \"desiring that someone not suffer\" can be \"anything but desiring that he be happy\"? Strictly speaking, it may prove difficult to answer Rousseau in the affirmative. For desiring that some- one should be happy or enjoy a good life seemingly requires more than just the necessary but insufficient condition of removing suffering. Yet it is here that Rousseau's account of pity conspicuously stops, as though a life without suffering would alone yield happiness, or that the prospects for happiness in political soeiety are so greatly circumscribed that the minimization of suffer- ing may be the best that we can do. Beneath his surface-level ovations to clas- sical virtue and the heroic life of the ancient citizen Rousseau's philosophy conceals a decidedly modern, realistic bent that few have acknowledged.53 To be sure, preventing cruelty is an honorable enough vocation. Obvi- ously a humane, tolerant, and forgiving society is preferable to one that is intolerant, vicious, and senselessly wicked. But it is hard to understand how a common commitment to minimizing suffering can serve as a sufficiently inspiring goal upon which to found purposive and robust community. That is to say that Rousseau's account of pity suffers from some of the same theoreti- cal debilities as the liberal philosophy it seemingly castigates.54 Like contem- porary liberalism, Rousseauian pity is negatively oriented (concerned with the prevention of harm, understood narrowly as unnecessary cruelty), non- perfectionist (concerned only with the means with which individuals pursue their ends, rather than the substantive content of those ends themselves), and seemingly indifferent if not directly hostile to the higher aspirations of com- munity and shared purposes.55 The second issue is whether this act of recognition, however uninspiring, can be made general, that is to say, a reliable and egalitarian source of politi- cal community and allegiance, rather than simply an individual whim or caprice. One solution to the incommodities of the civil state is to tutor imagi- This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 538 POLITICAL THEORY / August 2004 native, sentimental souls like Emile who live within civil society but are not a part of it. Yet this is an individual rather than a political response to the ail- ments of civil society. Rousseau also holds out the prospects of a more gen- eral, political solution to modern alienation and dependency in the compen- satory realm of citizenship. Whatever conventional differences divide us, there is at least one respect in which all remain equal and free. Citizenship, such as Rousseau describes in the First Discourse and the Social Contract, offers a much-needed ground of commonality whereby love of one's fellow citizens presumably displaces love of self. At first glance, it seems that the generalization of compassion might be an important part of this enterprise, forming the constitutive bond of citizenship that is written not in laws but in the hearts of citizens.56 But reinstating pity as a conventional and public-as opposed to a natural and private-virtue raises further difficulties. It is unclear how an ultimately private virtue like pity might be generalized into the imaginary realm of the public sphere without surrendering the intensely personal sensibilities that gave it its original force. As difficult as it may seem, the act of imagining what we share with a single, sensible individ- ual requires considerably less of us than recognizing something of ourselves in the abstract construct of an entire nation. And even if stretching pity to encompass the abstract category of citizenship might conceivably yield something like Habermas's \"constitutional patriotism,\" this Kantian concep- tion of patriotism as something rational, abstract, and unemotional seems the very antithesis of Rousseau's description of pity.57 The difficulty of seeing compassion as a source of democratic community is exacerbated by Rousseau's recurrent linkage between citizenship and mar- tial virtue. His ultimate expression of citizenship embraces the Spartan ideal of a citizen-soldier willing to fight for the political community. But presum- ably such a citizen in the truest sense of the term-one who kills and even dies for his political community-must be capable of bracketing the natural sensitivity to see another suffer harm. Citizenship in its extreme guise of friends and enemies demands that we repress the natural and sensible in favor of a pitilessness that is profoundly unnatural to human beings. As Shklar has observed, citizenship in large part rests on a suppression of the natural, including most notably that natural faculty of pity.58 Furthermore, linking pity to citizenship and the public sphere serves only to reintroduce the problem of difference at a higher level. Even if we could stretch our natural sympathy to include all members of the political commu- nity, the category of citizenship is by its very nature exclusionary. \"In prefer- ring one part of humanity to the rest,\" Tzvetan Todorov has observed, \"the citizen transgresses a fundamental principle, that of equality. Without explic- itly saying it, he accepts the notion that men are not equal.\"59 Too often, love This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Boyd / ROUSSEAU AND THE LIMITS OF DEMOCRATIC COMPASSION 539 of all members of our own political community is allied with ressentiment toward those of another. Pity's moral others emerge full-blown in the form of nationalism, xenophobia, and exclusion when one attempts to transpose compassion onto the political sphere. We should hardly be surprised, then, that Rousseau's political ideal of democratic citizenship under the social contract does not rest on compassion for others. Instead, as John Scott has argued, Rousseau's political thought aims to restore the natural wholeness of the state of nature by instituting a social contract whose explicit goal is to put every citizen \"in a position of per- fect independence from all the others,\" while remaining \"excessively depen- dent\" on the political community as a whole (SC, bk. 2, chap. 12, p. 77, emphasis added).60 The irony is that pity carries within itself virtually all of the vices Rous- seau most criticizes in his moral and political theory: first, the fact that pity is aversive means that it discourages willful agency; second, it rests inescap- ably upon the very differences and inequalities that ultimately alienate and separate us from ourselves and others; and third, its practice apparently entails the creation of altogether new dependencies between otherwise autonomous individuals. In fairness, these problems with compassion are not unforeseen by those who envision a larger role for compassion in political theory. Joan Tronto has misgivings about what she calls the \"otherness,\" \"paternalism,\" and \"privileged irresponsibility\" of an \"ethic of care.\" Because care arises out of the fact that not all humans or others or objects in the world are equally able, at all times, to take care of themselves ... The result is that those who receive care are often transformed into the \"other,\" and identified by whatever marks them as needing care: their economic plight, their seeming disability, and so forth.61 Tronto further notes that \"the convenient fiction of human equality\" is just that-a fiction-and thus a moral theory of compassion that takes these fun- damental dependencies and inequalities into account may be preferable to \"a moral theory, that because it presumes that all people are equal, is unable even to recognize them.\"62 The consequences of this last move are, I think, problematic for many of the reasons Rousseau suggests. Even if the governing principle of political equality is, as Tronto rightly notes, in some sense \"fictional,\" and the justice of liberal political theory is too often sentimentally unaware of private differ- ences and inequalities among citizens, it is unclear that as a consequence these underlying differences should be made more morally relevant with respect to the political sphere.63 The danger is that in trying to make political theory more attentive to difference, especially by displacing the centrality of This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000147.129.130.134 on Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:11:53 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 540 POLITICAL THEORY / August 2004 justice, rights, and equality, the political sphere may be tainted by the other- ness, privilege, and paternalism that Tronto herself admits sometimes plague an ethic of care, and which Rousseau earlier foresaw lurking in the emotions of pity and compassion. Tronto is not interested in debating \"the proposition that politics necessarily involves the corruption of whatever moral principles enter its arena,\" and she has a good sense of what these kinds of debates obscure.\" But the difficulty raised by Rousseau would seem to be precisely the opposite one: rather than compassion being corrupted by politics, the real danger is that the pathologies of pity, as described by Rousseau, might actu- ally distort the ideals of democratic political life when one tries to make com- passion more central to democratic theory and practice. Hannah Arendt, for example, complains that in its extreme political analogue, compassion may even shun the drawn-out wearisome processes of persuasion, negotiation and compromise, which are the processes of law and politics, and lend its voice to the suffering itself, which must claim for swift and direct action, that is, for action with the means of violence.65 Inspired instead by the Kantian thrust of Rousseau's political theory in the social contract, contemporary democratic theorists have sought ways of securing a kind of compensatory political equality that supercedes the differ- ences and inequalities of civil society and encourages more willful agency and self-legislation on the part of citizens.66 We have seen why Rousseau's account of political compassion is of little help on both of these scores. Despite the allure of a kind of generalized compassion, which might, like the ideal political citizenship of the social contract, serve as a way of transcend- ing the invidious distinctions of civil society, Rousseau's account of pity seemingly founders on the problem of difference. What democratic political life most needs is some ground for equality or likeness that transcends differ- ence. And yet we have seen that pity carries within itself the very differences it is supposed to transcend. Conversely, at those moments in democratic political life when we are most in need of the ability to make judgments-for example, in determining when cruelty needs to be met with force, or who truly deserves our compassion-pity's indiscriminacy becomes a stumbling block. Finally, pity's negative or aversive character would seem to beget only \"reluctant spectators\" and thus does little to encourage the kind of political agency and willful actors necessary for a truly democratic political life.

Literally, \"sharing the misery of another\"-this may be the necessary condition for us to think about acting to relieve that misery, but it is, as we will see below, far from a sufficient condition for this kind of willful human agency. 20.

Christopher Kelly offers a concise account of Rousseau's ambivalence toward the arts. \"Rousseau and the Case against (and for) the Arts,\" in The Legacy of Rousseau, esp. 20-25. 27. There are major scholarly debates about the consistency of Rousseau's account of pity as either an immanent or an active virtue (or both), and my analysis addresses these controversies implicitly. But I am mainly concerned here with the related but distinct question of whether com- miseration is ultimately experienced as \"sweet\" or \"irksome.\" 28. Cf. Melzer, Natural Goodness of Man, 16-17. 29. Contrast the reading of Margaret Ogrodnick, Instinct and Intimacy: Political Philosophy and Autobiography in Rousseau (Toronto, Canada: University of Toronto Press, 1999), 137. If my point here is correct, virtually all of what Jacques Derrida has written about the \"maternal metaphor\" for compassion in Rousseau is wrong. There is little textual evidence in Rousseau to suggest that children have a natural affection for their parents that is written into their hearts by God. And in the above-cited passages in the Second Discourse, Rousseau makes it clear that maternal or familial affection, like romantic love, arises only by habit or custom. Cf. Derrida, Of Grammatology, 173-75. 30. Although her subsequent discussion leads in a different direction, this point is supported by the following observation of Elizabeth Wingrove: \"Here the intensity of the spectator's reac- tion is rooted in its inability to differentiate itself from other beings.\" Rousseau's Republican Romance, 32. 31.

Roger Masters seems to go even further than this in claiming that natural pity is not just \"obscure,\" immanent, or aversive in the state of nature, but entirely nonexistent. Roger Masters, The Political Philosophy of Rousseau (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1968), esp. 140-42. Compare Marc Plattner, Rousseau 's State of Nature: An Interpretation of the Discourse on Inequality (Dekalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 1979), 84-87. 37. Hannah Arendt develops this point more fully, especially Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil (New York: Viking, 1968). The response of Martin Buber, who \"felt no pity at all\" for Eichmann because he could feel pity only \"for those whose actions I can understand in my heart,\" is suggestive (cited in Eichmann in Jerusalem, 251). In this view, com- passion for the guilty entails the recognition both of common humanity and of a similar suscepti- bility to evil in oneself. Absent any sense that one could have committed a similar crime, or indeed of the mental workings of the criminal, it is impossible to feel pity. Notice that in this view, contrary to Rousseau, it is the comprehensibility of deed itself, rather than our overriding com- passion for the doer as a fellow, sensible being, that is determinative. Compare Nietzsche, Gene- alogy of Morals, II, 10, who notes that the cognitive ability to separate the deed from the doer is what allows modern compassion to come into full bloom. 38. Martha Nussbaum has posited specific and helpful criteria under which we might wish to exercise compassion in lieu of justice. \"Compassion: The Basic Social Emotion,\" Social Philos- ophy and Policy 13 (1996): 27-58. Whitebrook has criticized these general criteria as too restric- tive. However, her attempt to incorporate a greater degree of discretion, making compassion into a kind of \"default position\" not just for those who suffer or even those who deserve compassion, but for anyone who is \"vulnerable,\" would seem to render compassion more open to this charge of its indiscriminacy. Cf. \"Compassion as a Political Virtue,\" esp. 537, 540-42. 39. Orwin has similarly described the difficulty of generalizing pity into a universal virtue because of its inherent partiality. \"Rousseau and the Discovery,\" 307-8. Compare Emile, IV, p. 227, where Rousseau himself raises the distinction between justice and compassion. While presumably one cannot be just without having compassion, simply being compassionate may not be enough to make one just. For a similar point, see Philonenko, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 187, and the discussion of Derrida, Of Grammatology, 191. 40. Stendahl, Red and Black (New York: Norton, 1969), 384-89. 41. See, for example, an early precursor of today's \"compassionate conservatism\" in Charles Murray, Losing Ground, American Social Policy, 1950-1980 (New York: Basic Books, 1984). 42.

The equality [Rousseau] wants-the reciprocity of free minds-excludes dependence of any kind, and in the first place the dependence created by the kindness of the benevolent. 48. Connolly, Identity/Difference, xiv. 49. Cf. Montaigne, \"On Cruelty,\" whose natural sensitivity extends even to plants! Michel de Montaigne, The Complete Essays (London: Penguin, 1991), 488. 50. Rousseau's revelation of the self as an ungrounded and perfectible tabula rasa invites dilemmas of difference and recognition unknown to earlier thinkers. Once the self has become in Rousseau's hands nothing more than the \"perfectible\" reflection of conventional differences and cultural influences, true recognition can take place only under two equally unlikely sets of condi- tions: either between equals in the pure state of nature or within civil society, when two selves have been forged by an identical set of social influences. With the advent of civil society, the first possibility vanishes forever, and with the continuous process of civilization, the likelihood of the latter diminishes by the day. 51. Rousseau looks to be guilty of pursuing what Joan Tronto has criticized as a \"morality first\" strategy by conceiving of pity as ultimately best confined to private relationships between individuals rather than constitutive of the political bonds between citizens. Tronto, Moral Bound- aries, 158. 52. Here, I have in mind certain \"communitarian critics\" of liberalism such as Robert Bellah, Amitai Etzioni, Michael Sandel, and Alasdair MacIntyre. Even if they do not explicitly or uni- formly call for more compassion (or more democracy!) as a remedy for these ailments of liberal- ism, they have presented a challenging criticism of the excessive thinness, legalism, neutrality, and sentimental inertness of liberal political theory. 53. Cf. Orwin, \"Rousseau and the Discovery,\" esp. 298-99; Plattner, Rousseau's State of Nature, 128-32. 54. By reading Rousseau here as a \"critic of liberalism\" and the primacy of private property, self-interest, and individual rights, I do not mean to suggest that his critique was not also applica- ble to aristocratic or courtly society. 55. Rousseau's stipulation that the sum of our obligations to our fellow citizens consists in refraining from causing them undue suffering is compatible with even the least flattering criti- cisms of contemporary liberal society by Bellah, MacIntyre, or Sandel. A market society charac- terized by self-interest, anomie, and atomization may prove the quintessential example of a world where we take no special pains to be cruel to others. Emphasizing both the thin obligations of fellow citizens to one another and the relative unlikelihood of even these minimal duties being recognized makes Rousseau among the most realistic of political theorists. 56. Cf. Melzer, Natural Goodness of Man, who suggests that an immanent human \"expan- siveness\" to identify with others forms the basis of patriotism, political community, and justice for Rousseau, esp. 170-71 n. Compare Ogrodnick, Instinct and Intimacy, 135-38. Below, I raise questions not just about this possibility for Rousseau, but also and more importantly whether even this immanent expansiveness can overcome the problem of moral otherness. 57. Cf.
