Sharks fall into a class known as ectotherms. This means that they do not regulate their own body temperature and rely on the external environment. An example of this is a snake sunning itself on a rock. The snake cannot warm its body since it is also an ectotherm and therefore uses the sun’s heat to do it for them. For sharks this means they must swim to different areas to regulate their body temperature. With sea temperatures rising, this will affect current migration patterns exhibited by sharks. Scientists have noticed a trend in shark movements that show them moving more toward the poles where cooler waters are. While many factors can be identified for this shift, climate change is the primary cause for this shift. Annotations Article in a scholarly journal Barash, Adi, et al.”Some Like It Hot: Investigating Thermoregulatory Behavior of Carcharhinid Sharks in a Natural Environment with Artificially Elevated Temperatures.” Fishes, vol 8, no 9, 2023, pp. 428. ProQuest, doi:10.3390/fishes8090428. This article was published in the academic journal, “Fishes”, a peer reviewed online journal which focuses on research done on fish and other aquatic animals. The journal is published by MDPI. This source establishes the idea of a thermal niche, where sharks prefer waters of a specific temperature range and will migrate to those specific waters instead of others. This helps create an ideal temperature for sharks and it can be used to estimate their movements in the ocean. This article also has a graph (Figure 3) that shows a clear temperature preference. This study also does a good job of recognizing some shortcomings in their data collection and explains them and what might have been seen if the errors had not been made. The errors were not big enough to discredit the source for this project. Its uses in the project will be used to prove that sharks prefer a specific thermal niche and that is what drives them to migrate throughout the year to stay in that niche. Article in a scholarly journal Gallant, Jeffery J, et al. “Influence of Environmental Variables on the Diel Movements of the Greenland Shark (Somniosus microcephalus) in the St. Lawrence Estuary.” The Canadian Field-Naturalist, vol 130, no 1, 2016. Published in 2016, this article is from the peer reviewed journal, “The Canadian Field-Naturalist” that focuses on field biology and ecology. This source will be useful as it shows a shark's ability to travel in different areas of the water column. This focuses on the Greenland shark, which makes diel movements. This is a movement through the water column that correlates with time of day. Not all sharks do this but these sharks like deep, cold water during the day and shallow (<30 m), warmer waters during the night. Figure 3 shows this very well and will be a good asset to use. By showing a variability in temperature throughout the water column, it can be used to predict other sharks movements as water temperatures rise. Article in a scholarly journal Hammerschlag, Neil, et al. “Ocean Warming Alters the Distributional Range, Migratory Timing, and Spatial Protections of an Apex Predator, the Tiger Shark (Galeocerdo cuvier).” Global Change Biology, vol 28, no 6, pp. 1990-2005, 2022. Wiley Online Library, DOI: 10.1111/gcb.16045. This was published in the biweekly journal, “Global Change Biology” in January of 2022. They are looking specifically at how the environment is changing and publish articles that fall into that category. This article will be useful because it shows movement of migrations in response to climate change. The study shows that Tiger sharks move around 3.5 degrees more north for every 1 degree C increase. It also has a very clear graph: Figure 5, which shows the northward movement over 4 decades. This study also looked into how the sharks were moving in relation to their management zones which help protect them from dangers such as fishing. They found that they had moved outside these zones and are now in danger of being harmed by fishing. Article in a scholarly journal Rosa, Rui, et al. “Early Life Exposure To Climate Change Impairs Tropical Shark Survival.” The Royal Society Publishing, vol 281, no 1793, 2014. National Library of Medicine, doi: 10.1098/rspb.2014.1738. This was a study from Portugal that was published by the peer reviewed journal, “The Royal Society Publishing” in 2014. This source will be useful because it succinctly shows the detrimental effects of warming waters on embryo development of brown banded bamboo sharks. It has two very useful figures: 1 and 5. These show visually the significant effects temperature and ocean acidification; as a result of global warming, have on development. The study found that when acclimating in these “bad” conditions they had high mortality rates as well as decreased fitness. It will help show that even in embryonic development, sharks are in danger. Conclusion After reading these sources, it would be a good idea to highlight the Tiger shark study (Hammerschlag, et al.) as it more directly relates to my thesis because of its observations on migration changes in response to global warming. The other sources help prove why this is happening. By establishing the idea that because sharks are ectotherms, they have a preferred thermal niche (Barash et al.), therefore they must change where they live to keep in this temperature range. Then by showing they can move throughout the water column (Gallant et al.) they can change depths and maybe experience new prey. And then by showing the detrimental effects warming waters have on embryonic development (Rosa et al.) the seriousness of this issue can be made apparent.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
