Communication barriers can hinder the delivery of services to children and families. Therefore, it is important to develop and employ communication strategies. Upon completion of Module 5, you will:  Define communication and understand the communication process.  Understand conversational styles.  Employ active listening techniques with regard to both verbal and nonverbal communication.  Identify potential communication barriers for children and families and develop strategies to overcome them.  Use your fluency privilege on behalf of the child and family.  Define Augmentative and Alternative Communication systems and understand their role in facilitating effective communication. Definition of Communication Communication can be defined as, “A process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior,” and, “The act or process of using words, sounds, signs, or behaviors to express or exchange information or to express your ideas, thoughts, feelings, etc., to someone else” (Merriam-Webster Online). The Communication Process Sending and receiving messages is a process. Any act of communication consists of a sender, a receiver, a message, and the environment in which the communication takes place. The sender says or does something, which is the message. The receiver hears, sees, or feels the message and puts it into a meaningful context, responds, and then becomes the sender. Environments can have a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the communication process. Some environmental elements that can affect communication include noise, interruptions, poor lighting, etc. BHP Module 5 - Communication 6 Conversational Styles In general, there are two parts of a message: the information, which consists of the words used in the message, and the metamessage, which is the way the words are spoken to identify the intent of the message. Variations in the metamessage can drastically change the meaning of a message. For example, someone might say, “Well, that’s the best news I’ve heard all day!” If the person is frowning and using a loud, harsh tone, the intent in the metamessage might be to convey displeasure or sarcasm. However, if the person is smiling and using an upbeat, pleasant tone, the metamessage would convey enthusiasm. The information is exactly the same in both instances, but the way the words are spoken completely changes the speaker’s intent. Subtleties in the metamessage can lead to misunderstanding for a receiver who does not easily pick up on the nuances of conversation or struggles with social cues. Conversational style is what we do to help convey our message, and each of us has our own unique approach. Because conversational styles and metamessages can be interpreted in different ways by different people, the message intended by the speaker is not always the message received. As such, you must pay close attention to all aspects of the sender’s message in order to fully understand the intent and respond appropriately. One example of a unique conversational style is the use of personal touch. Perhaps you occasionally touch someone’s arm while talking to them. Environment (Quiet, Noisy, Bright, Dark) Sender Receiver Sender Receiver Message Message BHP Module 5 - Communication 7 This style may seem perfectly natural to you, but the person whom you are touching may feel uncomfortable or confused by your use of personal contact during conversation. It is important to consider how your conversational style might impact the message that you are trying to relay. Active Listening Being a skilled listener is critical to your work as a BHP. By practicing active listening, you will increase your ability to not only hear what others are saying to you, but also to understand the intent and feelings of the messages that you receive in conversation. Active listening does not come naturally to most people, particularly in our fast-paced world. Instead, it is a skill that must be learned and continually developed. A skilled active listener is focused on the conversation: hearing the words of the speaker, deciphering the meaning of the message, and responding appropriately. Developing your active listening skills will help you to better understand the child and family that you are supporting. In addition to helping you do your job more effectively, staying fully engaged with the child during all interactions will help the child to: • Learn about his emotions and the emotions of others • Identify and name feelings • Develop strategies for managing behavior • Develop coping skills • Develop positive self-esteem • Feel secure and respected • Build a trusting relationship Carlson and Manktelow (n.d.) point out five key strategies for becoming an active listener. 1. Attend – Nonverbal communication speaks volumes. Show the speaker that you are paying close attention.  Look at the speaker.  Put aside distracting thoughts and ignore outside factors.  Do not think about what you are going to say next.  Pay attention to the speaker’s body language. 2. Show that you are listening – Your body language and minimal verbalization tell the speaker that you are interested.  Nod occasionally. BHP Module 5 - Communication 8  Show interest through facial expressions.  Have a relaxed, open posture.  Use encouraging verbal phrases such as “I see,” “uh huh,” and “yes.” 3. Provide Feedback – All messages are open to interpretation. Show the speaker that you understand what he means and how he feels by reflecting what is being said and asking questions.  Paraphrase and summarize what you hear by saying things like, “It sounds like what you’re saying is…” or “What I’m hearing is…” For example: The child yells, “He let the cat go!” Your reflective response might be, “You didn’t like it when he let the cat go. It made you mad.”  Ask clarifying questions.  Open-ended questions encourage the speaker to provide more information and to explore his feelings further. For example: “What are you feeling now?” or “What do you think happened?”  Closed-ended questions can be answered in just a few words and can help you gather information and confirm facts. For example: “Is this what you mean?” or “Do I have that right?” 4. Don’t Interrupt – It is frustrating to the speaker and may shut them down. Interrupting can also keep you from fully hearing and understanding the message.  Allow the speaker to finish before asking questions.  Do not interrupt to argue with the speaker.  Managing silence can be a challenge because it can feel awkward or unproductive. However, it can invite the speaker to say more. Keep in mind, “Listening is being silent in an active way” (Kelsey, 1976). 5. Respond with Support and Respect – It is important to convey Unconditional Positive Regard at all times.  Reinforce the communication through praise and understanding.  Offer reassurance or sympathy when appropriate.  Using interpretive responses can help the speaker begin problem solving. In the example above about the cat, you might follow your reflective statement with, “Maybe you got mad when he let the cat go because you worry that the cat will get hurt outside.” BHP Module 5 - Communication 9  Connecting feelings to behavior is a great first step in shaping challenging behavior. Synthesizing brings together the facts, feelings, thoughts, and behavior to promote new understanding for both the listener and the speaker. For example, you could say, “You care a lot about your cat, and you worry about her safety. Sometimes when you worry, you get mad, and then you yell or throw things.” Active Listening Do's and Don’ts Do Don’t Give all of your attention to the speaker Try to listen and talk at the same time/interrupt Put yourself in the speaker’s shoes Offer solutions Concentrate on what is (and isn’t) being said Jump to conclusions Recognize your own biases Tell the child what he or she is feeling Pay attention to nonverbal messages Dismiss the child’s feelings Nonverbal Communication Communicating is a skill that most people feel they do well, but they often see others as needing to improve. Even though most people see communication problems as other people’s responsibility, research shows that the average person only listens to about 25% of what is being said to them (Husman, Lahiff, & Penrose, 1988). Words, facial expressions, and tone convey the content and meaning of a message. Research has shown that words, or what is said, are actually much less important to listeners than how it is said. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian (1981) published a groundbreaking study that suggested that when the message and metamessage seem inconsistent with one another (“Well, that’s the best news I’ve heard all day!” spoken in an angry tone) the spoken word accounts for only 7% of the message. Facial expression and body language will account for 55% of the message and tone of voice will account for 38%. This research indicates that, in some situations, 93% of the information conveyed in an interaction is done nonverbally, which can present some real challenges to effective communication. BHP Module 5 - Communication 10 Reading nonverbal communication can be difficult because, like verbal communication, several factors can impact its delivery. In order to increase your ability to understand a person’s current emotional state and what he is truly communicating, Thompson (2011) suggests applying the 3 C’s of Nonverbal Communication: context, clusters, and congruence. • Context includes the current environment, the relationship and history between those communicating, and each person’s role in the relationship (the BHP and the child, for example). • Clusters give us the whole picture. Paying attention to nonverbal communication clusters keeps us from interpreting meaning based on a single gesture. For example, crossing your arms may mean that you are closed-minded, but if you are also shivering and your teeth are chattering, you are most likely just in need of a sweater. • Congruence helps us to determine if the words spoken match the body language. If someone bumps his head and then states that he is fine, but he is teary-eyed and wincing, you likely need to dig a little deeper. Your Body Language 55% How You Speak 38% Words 7% What Makes an Impression? BHP Module 5 - Communication 11 Taken together, Dr. Mehrabian’s percentage formula and the 3 C’s of Nonverbal Communication remind us that a single gesture does not tell the whole story, but rather it invites us to observe further to gain a better understanding of the situation. As a BHP, you are responsible for communicating observations, information, and recommendations about the child and the family to the Treatment Team and/or IEP Team. You must also relay information to the child and in some cases the family, too. As such, your ability to communicate accurately and effectively will enable effective implementation of treatment goals and minimize misunderstandings. Communication Styles Each person has his own unique way of learning and processing information. It is beneficial to have insight into your own communication style and how it may impact your interactions with others. In general, there are 4 dominant communication styles: Doers, Thinkers, Influencers, and Connectors (How you connect and disconnect, n.d.). 3 C's Context Clusters Congruence BHP Module 5 - Communication 12 Rate Your Dominant Communication Style When under pressure, do you tend to be __________?

Your secondary score indicates your fallback or adaptive style or styles. There are strengths associated with each style as well as limitations. If you scored below a five on any style, be aware of how you treat others who demonstrate this style. You may have little patience or tolerance for people who tend toward these styles. Yet these are the people you need around you to support your efforts. Do not alienate them. Instead, find ways to collaborate with them. In the end, all the styles need to develop more tolerance for the other styles, and develop an appreciative point of view for what each style brings to the table. Diversity is the key to innovation and success! BHP Module 5 - Communication 13 The two styles most focused on tasks are Doers and Thinkers. • Doers like to be in control, get to the point, and see results. They do not like formalities or details. They are self-starters who like autonomy, freedom, and public recognition. Doers can tend to be impatient and insensitive to others. Recommended tips for communicating with Doers include being clear, specific, brief, and sticking to business. • Thinkers like to gather information and take time making decisions. They like clear expectations, specific goals, deadlines, and structure. They like to compete and love to win. They are proud of their work and they like acknowledgement, but they will not ask for it. Thinkers can appear combative, critical, and sarcastic. Recommended tips for communicating with Thinkers include being accurate, realistic, and prepared for a debate. The two styles most focused on relationships are Influencers and Connectors. • Influencers like to verbally process their thoughts or “think out loud.” When they get excited, they tend to interrupt others. They view this trait as part of a conversation, not as a disruption. They like working around people and tend to be friendly, creative, supportive, and positive. Influencers can be indecisive and seem impractical. Recommended tips for communicating with Influencers include providing a warm and friendly environment, putting details in writing, and asking “feeling” questions. • Connectors need others to set the tone and determine the direction, but they are consistent and reliable once given their responsibilities. They like to work with others, but they do not trust others easily. Although they have opinions, they do not readily offer them. They desire consistency and appreciate acknowledgement for effort as well as results. Connectors can appear stubborn and rejecting of impulsiveness. Recommended tips for communicating with Connectors include breaking the ice, presenting your case non- threateningly, and giving them time to respond to your ideas. As a BHP, you can promote healthy communication by understanding both the child and family’s unique communication styles, as well as being aware of yours. If you take into consideration the needs of each style when communicating with others, you have the greatest chance of establishing rapport and trust. BHP Module 5 - Communication 14 Assertive Communication As a BHP, you are expected to set limits, teach skills, and reinforce the child’s success and pro-social behavior. While specific strategies for successfully carrying out these responsibilities will be taught in Module 11 – Understanding and Managing Behavior and Module 12 – Principles of Instruction, adopting an assertive style of speaking is a critical component of doing your job effectively. Using assertive communication means presenting your thoughts, feelings, and ideas in a manner that is honest, direct, and respectful of the rights of others. Strategies for assertive communication include: • Having a clear message, being specific, and sticking to the point. • Choosing the right time and place to communicate that message. • Using a calm, respectful tone of voice. • Maintaining good posture and eye contact. • Using “I” messages.  “I” messages facilitate the expression of feelings or requests in a way that does not attack or blame, and they allow the speaker to take responsibility for his response to the issue.  The format for an “I” statement is as follows: “I feel _______________ when _______________ because _______________.” For example, “I feel frustrated when there are dirty dishes on the counter top because they attract ants.” As with all communication, your facial expression, tone of voice, and choice of words are critical to conveying a message that is respectful, builds trust, and fosters self-esteem. Your turn to practice: write an “I” message for two of the situations below. 1. The child is refusing to wear a coat outside on a cold, windy autumn day. 2. The child has just yelled at you saying, “I wish I had a different BHP!” 3. A family member yelled at the child because the child refused to be quiet. 4. The caregiver asks you to babysit, just this once. 5. The child asks you to do something for her that you know she is capable of doing herself. I feel _______________ when ________________ because ____________________. I feel _______________ when ________________ because ____________________. BHP Module 5 - Communication 15 It is important to avoid passive or aggressive communication styles because these can undermine your professional relationship with the child and family, and thus, can hinder the child’s success. An individual using a passive communication style avoids conflict and the disapproval of others by withholding honest and direct expressions of feelings. Aggressive communicators seek to force their points of view onto others with little regard for others’ thoughts or feelings. Can you see how being an assertive communicator is more respectful, productive, and professional? Communication with the Family As we discussed in Module 2 – Professionalism and Module 3 – Working as a Team, it is important for you, as a BHP, to create an atmosphere that inspires growth and healing. Remember that you are there to support the child and family and that you need to develop and maintain an Unconditional Positive Regard for both parties in order to be successful. Just like adults, each child has a unique communication style. You must develop an understanding of the communication style of the child whom you support. You must listen to the child, encourage him to communicate wants, needs, thoughts, and emotions, and praise all attempts at appropriate communication. You also need to understand how to effectively provide direction and instruction to the child. When communicating with parents or caregivers, remember to respect their authority and expertise. It is important to keep all caregivers informed about the work you are doing with their children, including progress, setbacks, or struggles. You must also quickly identify and correct any miscommunications with the child and family. Communication Barriers Communication can be disrupted in many ways. Barriers to effective communication include: • Vocabulary – Communication can break down when a message is communicated in technical language that is unfamiliar to the listener or when the vocabulary is simply too mature or advanced for the listener to understand. • Environment – A noisy or distracting environment can make it very hard to understand someone with a communication deficit. Noises and BHP Module 5 - Communication 16 distractions can also make it difficult for the child to process and understand what is being communicated. • Understanding – There may be times when you have difficulty understanding the child whom you support and vice versa. This can be attributed to speech, environment, and vocabulary, as well as hearing or visual impairments, aphasia (inability to speak), or processing problems. • Unintelligible or Inaudible Speech – The child might have speech that is difficult to understand because he speaks very softly, too quickly, or cannot articulate well. • Complex Communication Needs – The child might have difficulty in communication as a result of significant speech, language, or cognitive impairments. A person with complex communication needs cannot effectively communicate through his current communication method. • Augmented Alternative Communication (AAC) – The use of AAC devices can also present a communication barrier if people around the individual employing the device are not familiar with it or if the child does not have the tools needed to effectively convey information. We will discuss AAC systems later in this module. Barriers to Effective Listening Communication barriers result from many things, including the listener being too eager to help, being anxious about the content of the message, or being distracted by surrounding activities. These types of barriers include: • Interrupting • Providing solutions • Labeling • Judging • Criticizing • Shaming • Blaming • Showing boredom • Multitasking It is vitally important that children with communication challenges are given every opportunity to overcome those challenges in order to have their BHP Module 5 - Communication 17 needs and wants met. You must allow them to relay information and help them connect with the people around them. As a BHP, you play an important role in helping the child overcome communication barriers. In this section, we will explore ways to help you do just that. Fluency Privilege and the Communication Ally The ability to communicate, to understand others, and to have them understand you is something that many of us take for granted. People who communicate easily with those around them have what Dr. Mayer Shevin (1997) calls “Fluency Privilege.” Shevin, who was a lifelong advocate for individuals with disabilities, specifically defines fluency privilege as “the advantages automatically accruing to people who are competent, fluent speakers of the standard dialect of the dominant language of a given society.” In other words, people with fluency privilege can enter a situation and expect to be understood and to understand those around them. Other people, including the child whom you support, may experience barriers to communication that keep them from understanding and being understood. You can help the child whom you support receive or relay the messages by acting as a “Communication Ally.” Communication Allies, as Shevin (1997) defines, are “people who use their fluency privilege on behalf of those who experience limited or impaired ability to communicate fluently.” For example, when you help a child create a list of personal goals prior to a team meeting, or when you use a Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) to tell the child he is going to the doctor’s office, you are being a Communication Ally. There may be times when the child whom you support becomes frustrated due to communication barriers. This frustration may result in angry outbursts, withdrawal, or refusal to engage in activities. When this occurs, asking yourself the following questions might help you move toward a solution. • Do I understand what the child is trying to say to me? • Has the child tried to convey a need or want that I missed? Communication is not an end goal in and of itself; rather it is a tool to allow individuals to participate effectively and attain their goals at home, at school, at work or in the community. ~ Light & McNaughton, 2015 BHP Module 5 - Communication 18 • What can I do to show the child that I understand? Tips for Communicating with People with Disabilities Etiquette for interacting with people with disabilities is based primarily on respect and courtesy. Outlined below are tips to help you in communicating with adults and children with disabilities. General Tips for Communicating with Children with Disabilities • When introduced to a person with a disability, it is acceptable to offer to shake hands. People with limited hand-use or who wear an artificial limb can usually shake hands. (Shaking hands with the left hand is an acceptable greeting.) • If you offer assistance, wait until the offer is accepted or refused. Then listen to or ask for instructions. • Treat adults as adults. Address people who have disabilities by their first names only when extending the same familiarity to all others. • Relax. Do not be embarrassed if you happen to use common expressions such as \"See you later,\" with someone who has a visual impairment or \"Did you hear about that?\" with someone who has a hearing impairment. • Do not be afraid to ask questions when you are unsure of what to do. Tips for Communicating with Individuals Who are Blind or Visually Impaired • Speak to the individual when you approach him or her. • State clearly who you are. • Speak in a normal tone of voice. • When conversing in a group, remember to identify yourself and the person to whom you are speaking. • Never touch or distract a service animal without first asking the owner. • Tell the individual when you are leaving. • Do not attempt to lead the individual without first asking. Allow the person to hold your arm and control her or his own movements. • Be descriptive when giving directions. Verbally give the person the information that is visually obvious to individuals who can see. For example, if you are approaching steps, mention how many steps. • If you are offering a seat, gently place the individual's hand on the back or arm of the chair so that the person can locate the seat. BHP Module 5 - Communication 19 Tips for Communicating with Individuals Who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing • Gain the person's attention before starting a conversation (i.e., move into the person’s line of sight or tap the person gently on the shoulder or arm). • Look directly at the individual, face the light, speak clearly in a normal tone of voice, and keep your hands away from your face. Use short, simple sentences. Avoid chewing gum. • If the individual uses a sign language interpreter, speak directly to the person, not the interpreter. • If you telephone an individual who is hard of hearing, let the phone ring longer than usual. Speak clearly and be prepared to repeat the reason for the call and restate who you are. • If you do not have a Text Telephone (TTY), dial 711 to reach the National Telecommunications Relay Service, which facilitates the call between you and an individual who uses a TTY. Tips for Communicating with Individuals with Mobility Impairments • If possible, put yourself at the wheelchair user's eye level. • Do not lean on a wheelchair or any other assistive device. • Never patronize people who use wheelchairs by patting them on the head or shoulder. • Do not assume that the individual wants to be pushed. Ask first. • Offer assistance if the individual appears to be having difficulty opening a door. • If you telephone the individual, allow the phone to ring longer than usual to allow extra time for the person to reach the telephone. Tips for Communicating with Individuals with Speech Impairments • If you do not understand something that the individual says, do not pretend that you do. Ask the individual to repeat what he or she said and then repeat it. • Be patient. Take as much time as necessary. • Try to ask questions that require only short answers or a nod of the head. • Concentrate on what the individual is saying. • Do not speak for the individual or attempt to finish her or his sentences. BHP Module 5 - Communication 20 • If you are having difficulty understanding the individual, consider writing as an alternative means of communicating, but first ask the individual if this method is acceptable. Tips for Communicating with a Child who is Nonverbal • Pay close attention. • Learn what the child’s gestures mean. • Keep the message simple and direct. • Focus on action. Show or ask the child what you want him or her to do, not what you want him or her to stop doing. • Let the parent and the child teach you how to use their communication equipment. Tips for Communicating with Individuals with Cognitive Disabilities • If you are in a public area with many distractions, consider moving to a quiet or private location. • Be prepared to repeat what you say, orally or in writing. • Offer assistance completing forms or understanding written instructions and provide extra time for decision-making. Wait for the individual to accept the offer of assistance; do not \"over-assist\" or be patronizing. • Be patient, flexible, and supportive. Take time to understand the individual and make sure the individual understands you. Remember • Relax. • Treat the individual with dignity, respect, and courtesy. • Listen to the individual. • Offer assistance but do not insist or be offended if your offer is not accepted. Note: From U.S. Department of Labor. Reprinted with permission. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, AAC: “includes all forms of communication (other than oral speech) that are used to express thoughts, needs, wants, and ideas. We all use AAC when we make facial expressions or gestures, use symbols, pictures, or write. People with severe speech or language problems rely on AAC to supplement... or replace speech” (asha.org, n.d.). BHP Module 5 - Communication 21 Many of us use AAC on a daily basis in the form of cell phones or tablets with speech generated text. In the past, AAC devices were harder to acquire, but the recent advancements in technology have made an array of AAC devices available to those who depend on it. Today, AAC has become much more mainstream with communication apps available for cell phones, tablets, iPads, and laptops. This can make choosing the right form of AAC challenging for families. As such, it is important for families to consult with professionals when choosing the appropriate AAC device for the user. When deciding which AAC device to use, caregivers and professionals should ask some key questions, including: • Who will the child be using AAC to communicate with? • In what environment will the child be using AAC to communicate? • What are the tools and strategies that will be most effective for this child? (Keep in mind that those tools and strategies might vary from setting to setting.) In order for a child who uses AAC to live a meaningful, fulfilling life, everyone who interacts with the child should strive to become familiar with the child’s AAC. Studies have shown that people who use AAC communicate most often with two groups: close family and paid providers (Blackstone, 1999). Unfortunately, this finding indicates that other possible communicative relationships with friends, neighbors, and strangers are lacking. Because people who do not interact with the child one-to-one on a daily basis do not understand the child’s attempts to communicate, establishing relationships with anyone other than close family and paid providers can be difficult for the child. Therefore, it is important to encourage the use of AAC equipment outside of the family and paid provider circles. Selecting the proper AAC device involves matching the “amount and kind of language in the user’s brain to the amount and kind of language available in a particular AAC device” (augcominc.com, n.d.). This process ensures that the “individual can generate language as efficiently and effectively as possible” (augcominc.com, n.d.). “Unaided” AAC includes gestures, body language, and/or sign language. “Aided” AAC systems range from paper and pencil to communication books and boards as well as electronic devices that produce voice (speech generating devices) and/or written output (asha.org). BHP Module 5 - Communication 22 One common type of unaided AAC is Visual Gestural Communication, or VGC. Unlike established languages such as English, French, or American Sign Language, VGC is “a communication mode that uses gestures, facial expressions, and body language” (DHHS, 2013). VGC can be useful for people who have difficulty using other forms of communication. There are two main types of Aided Augmented Alternative Communication Systems: non-electronic and electronic. Non-Electronic AAC Systems Non-electronic systems may include wallets, boards, books, and folders. The user has a choice of vocabulary items that he can select to communicate a message to others. Two types of non-electronic systems are communication books or boards and Picture Exchange Communication Systems (PECS). • Communication Books or Boards A communication book or board is made up of words, phrases, symbols, or pictures. The user can point to these words, phrases, symbols, or pictures to construct a message. Communication books or boards vary in design, depending on the needs of the user. • Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) PECS is a method that teaches the individual to initiate an exchange with a communicative partner. The individual learns to give a picture of a desired item (a ball, for instance) to his communication partner, who then gives the desired item to the individual. Once the individual learns this concept, he is taught how to put vocabulary together to form sentences. Fawcett (2014) and pecsusa.com (n.d.) outline 6 phases of PECS. PECS Phases Phase I: How to Communicate In the first phase, children are taught how to communicate, including how to initiate communication. Children learn to present a picture in exchange for a desired item. Phase II: Distance and Persistence In the second phase, children are taught to use the skills that they learned in the previous phase and to generalize those skills. They are taught to use their skills in different environments, with different people, and for longer distances. BHP Module 5 - Communication 23 Phase III: Picture Discrimination In the third phase, children learn to discriminate between multiple pictures and select their preferred item, thereby learning to ask for their favorite things. Phase IV: Sentence Structure In the fourth phase, children learn to combine single pictures to construct simple sentences. In this phase, children can learn to use an “I want” picture followed by a picture of their desired item. Phase V: Answering Questions In the fifth phase, children learn to use their pictures to answer the question, “What do you want?” Phase VI: Commenting In the sixth phase, children learn to use their pictures to answer questions such as “What do you see?” and “What do you hear?” They also use their pictures to create commenting sentences that might begin with, “I see,” “I have,” etc. Devices that are used to communicate with PECS range from the traditional communication book (a binder with pictures that stick with Velcro) to PECS software programs, to PECS iPhone apps and more. These high-tech options offer the user an opportunity to access a broader range of pictures and faster communication. Electronic AAC Systems Electronic systems have features that allow individuals to generate messages more quickly and efficiently than non-electronic systems. There are many different types of electronic systems, but in general they can be sub- divided into two categories. • AAC devices with digitized speech output:  Contain natural speech that has been recorded, stored, and reproduced.  Are considered a closed system because the device’s capacity is limited to the words, phrases, or messages that have been pre- stored for the user under the direction of the Speech Language Pathologist.  Are ideal for those who do not have the linguistic capacity to formulate messages independently, who have cognitive or language impairments, or who are unable to generate messages through spelling or word-by-word message development. BHP Module 5 - Communication 24 • AAC devices with synthesized speech output:  Require message formulation by spelling and device access by physical contact direct selection techniques (pointing with finger, head stick, mouth stick, etc.).  An individual must have sufficient spelling skills to generate messages independently and be able to access the device using physical contact direct selection.  Permit multiple methods of message formulation and multiple methods of device access.  Represent language using text and or pictographs. Non-literate users with cognitive and linguistic abilities to generate messages independently can use pictures or icons to communicate their thoughts, opinions, and needs.  Has the ability to store many messages and retrieve them efficiently.  Accommodates access in two ways:  Direct selection either physically or through accessories such as a head mouse, optical head pointer, or joystick.  Indirect selection methods such as scanning, in which the user flips a switch when the device scans over a particular word or object. Morse code can also be used, requiring only an eye blink for successful operation. Note: From Augmentative Communication, Inc. by S. Blackstone. Adapted and reprinted with permission. Conclusion The ability to communicate effectively is an important skill that takes time and practice to develop. As a BHP and a member of the child’s team, it is critical that you understand and that you are able to adapt to multiple communication styles and modalities. Your ability to do so will help you to overcome communication barriers and make you a stronger communication ally for the child and family that you support. The desirable long term communication outcome for the child is being able to say what he wants to say, to whoever he wants to say it, whenever and wherever he wants to say it, and being able to understand other people. ~Porter & Burkhart, 2015 Appendix 25 References Appendix 26 References Module 5 – Communication American-Speech-Language-Hearing-Association.
