{"path":"2025/02/26/Attachments/image-1.png","text":"When a new stimulus occurs in our environment, we tend to pay immediate attention to itin what is called an orienting reflex. This makes sense, as we need to assess whether the stimulus is important or irrelevant, dangerous, o innocuous. When a stimulus persists over time, we tend to respond less and less to it in a process calied habituation. As an example, do you notice the sound of the air conditioner in the room uniess you are asked to pay attention to t? Your nervous system leams to just disregard ongoing, unchanging events. Orienting reflex: the tendency of an organism to orient ts sense toward unexpected stimuli Habituation: The tendency of an organism to ignore repeated stimuli(tendency to orient siowly decreases) There are many benefits of habituation: . We do not waste cogniive resources on stimuli that do not need our attention. b.. We are able to focus our attention only on relevant, salient events in our surroundings. c. Some research suggests that painful headaches called migraines may result from an inability to habituate, and so habituation may protect the brain. Almost all creatures have the capacity for habituation. Is the simplest type of leaming seen in lving things (babies and fetuses too) With habituation you get the best of both worlds. You can respond to novel stimul that may pose a danger and you can ignore stimuli that have been checked out and deemed harmiess = gives us flexibity When a constant stimulus suddenly changes, we may retum our attention to it in a process called dishabituation. Most parents leam to ignore, even phase out, the low drone of a crying baby when they are letting the baby leam to self-soothe. But f that low drone sudden tumed into a wail or a shriek, that parent wouild jump up to see what is wrong. That s how attending to changing stimui works. â€˜There are some practical ways in which we can use habituation to help people. A good example s in treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, discussed in your textbook. By utlizing prolonged exposure therapy, those who are highly sensiive to certain stimuli may become less sensitive and be able to function more effectively. What other conditions might this help treat?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
