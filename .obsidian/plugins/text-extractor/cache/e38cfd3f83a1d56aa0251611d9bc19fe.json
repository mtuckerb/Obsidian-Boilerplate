Tucker Bradford POS-101 Ronald Schmidt 13 June 2025 The Fifteenth Amendment was ratiﬁed in 1870, in the wake of the Civil War. It provides that “the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” and it gives Congress the “power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” (Shelby County v Holder) The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (and subsequent reauthorizations) signiﬁcantly curtailed certain state's rights as provided for in Article 1 Section 4 of the Constitution. This action was justiﬁed as necessary to combat a century long systemic suppression of suffrage to certain groups in America. When the act was passed in 1965, it was intended to last 5 years. It was amended and reauthorized again in 1982 (for 25 years) and again in 2006 (for 25 years). (Shelby County v Holder) When the Constitution was written, our \"united\" states were divided on many topics. Not the least of which were the social and economic implications of slavery. Certain compromises were necessary in order to manifest a united states out of these disparate colonies. One such compromise was granting the State's \"broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised\" (Carrington v. Rash). At the end of the Civil War, our nation ﬁnally agreed that slavery and racial discrimination were not national values that would be permitted, upheld, or promoted by our government, neither at the national nor state level. Despite this hard won resolution, segregation and discrimination remained prevalent in some parts of the United States. One might view this as a systemic and intentional subversion of the Civil War Amendments, an act of non-violent political insurgency or interposition on the part of those state and local jurisdictions. Accordingly, Congress was well within its rights to enact legislation to provide sweeping oversight of the underlying methods of this systemic interposition. One of the strongest arguments against the Voting Rights Act and its reauthorizations, has been that it was not uniform amongst the states (violating the \"fundamental principle of equal sovereignty,\" guaranteed the states in the Constitution) (Shelby County v Holder). While this Act was upheld in every challenge between 1965 and 2013, perhaps the critical ﬂaw of the legislation was that it did not go far enough. It is well established that gerrymandering (e.g. voter ID requirements, and redistricting) have negatively inﬂuenced suffrage in states outside of those covered by the Voting Rights Act—\"In North Carolina, there is a long history of egregious gerrymandering that has worsened over the years\" (Fair Elections Center, 3 July 2024 ). Another argument upheld by the majority is that §4(b)’s coverage is not based on \"current conditions\"(Shelby County v Holder). While this may be true when viewed through the lens of speciﬁc historical methods, Justice Ginsberg aptly points out that \"Between 1982 and 2005, Alabama had one of the highest rates of successful §2 suits, second only to its VRA-covered neighbor Mississippi.\" (Shelby County v Holder). Further, these outcomes are not limited to VRA covered states; \"Alexis Crosby highlights how gerrymandering has resulted in the packing Black voters from two separate cities and counties in Ohio into the same district.\" (Fair Elections Center, 3 July 2024.) The federal government has the right under Article 1 §4 of the Constitution to \"at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing (sic) Senators.\" Thus the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was Constitutionally enabled and valid. As Ginsberg points out in her dissent, congressional power to legislate differential treatment, has been long established in cases such as 28 U. S. C. §3704, 26 U. S. C. §142(l), and 42 U. S. C. §3796bb (Shelby County v Holder.) Finally, the chief shortcoming of the VRA is not that it overreaches Constitutional affordances, nor that it is no longer based on \"current conditions\" but rather that the formula may no longer represent the complete scope of voter suppression techniques employed by the various states. Ibid. Ginsberg afﬁrms the judgement of the Court of Appeals and, though this precedent set by the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder—which signiﬁcantly undermines our generations long ﬁght for civil rights—will stand it is my hope that a future congress will move to rewrite, extend, and reafﬁrm the VRA. In so doing will recommit the United States of America to the vanguard of universal civil rights. Works Cited Carrington v.
