Cultural competence has been presented as a framework capable of promoting culturally sensitive practice and for training cross- cultural workers. However, a smorgasbord of definitions and conceptualizations has generated intense controversy around the construct, with many questioning its rele- vance or ability to address structural problems. Disenchantment has led to calls to jettison and replace cultural competence with cultural humility. This paper presents a critical reflection on cultural competence and cultural humility, including critiquing the critiques of cultural competence. \u0002 Findings: A critically reflective analysis suggests that semantic appeal does not neces- sarily give cultural humility a utilitarian edge over the construct it seeks to supplant. Cultural humility appears not to add more value to social work practice than cultural competence. From a social work perspective, cultural humility is essentially a repacka- ging of anti-oppressive practice; the fundamental ideas underpinning cultural humility have previously been developed and are foundational principles of anti-oppressive social work practice and education. Critical analysis also reveals that many of the critiques of cultural competence lack analytical rigour. \u0002 Applications: Deep-level theoretical analyses can lead to innovative perspectives that allow for critical re-examination of extant methodological approaches and promote culturally empowering social work practices in our super-diverse, postmodern world. Rather than dismissing long-standing, potentially effective theoretical and practice tools with happy abandon, adapting them in light of current developments would help move social work to a new, enlightened level of relevance in working with diversity and difference.

Cultural competence is considered an ethical imperative and a central tenet of social work practice (Allen-Meares, 2007; Fisher-Borne, Cain, & Martin, 2015; Furlong & Wight, 2011; Garran & Rozas, 2013; Johnson & Munch, 2009); it is a recurring theme in social work theory and research (Allen-Meares, 2007; Ben-Ari & Strier, 2010). Cultural competence is also an embedded feature, or attracting attention in social work education in diﬀerent countries (Furness, 2005; Hong, Stokes, Byoun, Furuto, & Kim, 2013; Mlcek, 2014; Rodenborg & Boisen, 2013; Sousa & Almeida, 2016). Cultural competence has been well received in many other professions, which have established standards for cultural competency in their educational and training programmes (Harrison & Turner, 2011; Jani, Pierce, Ortiz, & Sowbel, 2011). Cultural competence is presented as a framework capable of pro- moting respect for cultural diversity and diﬀerence, and is included in numerous professional mandates and organizational policy guidelines (Fisher-Borne et al., 2015). Cultural competence emerged in the 1980s—in America—as a framework for addressing the ethno-cultural diversity produced by immigration and the need for social work to address the diversity (Blunt, 2007; Kirmayer, 2012). Cultural competence has faced sharp criticism despite achieving wide acceptance and a highly positive status in its short career (Furlong & Wight, 2011). Cultural competence has been blamed for the tendency to be tokenistic (Furlong & Wight, 2011; Herring, Spangaro, Lauw, & McNamara, 2013); for assuming that the worker is from a dominant culture; for treating culture as a neutral phenomenon; and for lacking power analysis (Garran & Rozas, 2013; Sakamoto, 2007). Many critics, especially healthcare practitioners and some social workers (Abell, Manuel, & Schoeneman, 2015; Duntley-Matos, 2014; Kools, Chimwaza, & Macha, 2015; Lund & Lee, 2015; Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998; Yeager & Bauer-Wu, 2013) have called for the replacement of cultural competence with cultural humility. This article presents a critical analysis of cultural competence and cultural humility. It argues that, although cultural humility sounds semantically appealing and politically correct, it appears not to have greater practice advantage over cul- tural competence. The article also argues that the fundamental underpinnings of cultural humility have previously been developed and are key principles in anti- oppressive social work practice and education. The article is divided into two broad sections, the ﬁrst of which provides a reﬂective review of cultural competence and the heated debate it has generated. The ﬁrst section also presents a critical analysis of the critiques of cultural competence; it concludes that many of the critiques (e.g., Duntley-Matos, 2014; Hook, 2014; Lund & Lee, 2015; Ross, 2010; Schuldberg Danso 411 et al., 2012) provide only a limited view of the concept. Some critics make only passing references or fail to critically examine the concept they are criticizing. Section two discusses the concept of cultural humility, including questioning its contribution to social work. This work makes an important contribution to cross- cultural scholarship; it distinguishes itself from related articles in three notable ways. Besides being the ﬁrst to expose the uncritical critiques of cultural compe- tence, it is also the only work so far to address the limitations of cultural humility; previous authors have promoted cultural humility as an unproblematic construct. The article also represents the ﬁrst attempt to question the novelty of the ideas underpinning cultural humility. It argues that cultural humility is essentially a rebranding of anti-oppressive practice, which may explain why it has not gained the level of attention that cultural competence has garnered in social work. I ﬁrst summarize the key cross-cultural practice concepts to contextualize the discussion. Overview of cultural diversity concepts Various postmodern concepts, often used interchangeably, emerged in the 1980s and 1990s to demonstrate how cross-cultural workers engage with cultural diversity and diﬀerence (Foronda, Baptiste, Reinholdt, & Ousman, 2016; Horevitz, Lawson, & Chow, 2013). The concepts emerged as a result of the ethno-cultural diversity many Western countries experienced from immigration and globalization (Furness, 2005; Kirmayer, 2012). The proliferation of diversity concepts reﬂects not only the multidimensional and dynamic nature of culture but also the countless ways in which culture has been conceptualized. Table 1 highlights the key cross-cultural concepts in the literature. This article focuses speciﬁcally on cultural competence and cultural humility. Cultural competence The construct cultural competence originated in social work (Nadan, 2014), with Cross, Bazron, Dennis, and Isaacs (1989), Green (1982), and Solomon (1976) acknowledged as introducing the idea of culturally competent practice (Garran & Rozas, 2013). Cultural competence may be a much-maligned construct now, however, its emergence was quite revolutionary in that it reﬂected a signiﬁcant advance in thinking within social work about practice in an increasingly multicul- tural environment (Jani et al., 2011). The introduction of cultural competence has brought more awareness to issues of diversity and diﬀerence in social work. An oft-cited deﬁnition refers to cultural competence as a ‘‘set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals and enable that system, agency, or those professionals to work eﬀectively in cross-cultural situations’’ (Cross et al., 1989, p. 3). Cultural competence is also deﬁned as the process by which individuals and systems respond respectfully and eﬀectively to people of all cultures, languages, classes, races, ethnic backgrounds, religions, spiritual traditions, immigration status, and other diversity 412 Journal of Social Work 18(4) Table 1.

The above deﬁnitions are more nuanced and contrast sharply with those pre- sented by critics of cultural competence. Critics often portray cultural competence as comprising three elements: (a) cultural awareness—of practitioners’ own cultural values, beliefs, and attitudes; (b) knowledge—of diverse people and their needs as well as attitudes that enhance the practitioner–client relationship; and (c) skills— abilities used to combine awareness and knowledge about others (Chiu, Lonner, Matsumoto, & Ward, 2013; Nadan & Ben-Ari, 2013; Nadan, Weinberg-Kurnik, & Ben-Ari, 2016) and to provide culturally appropriate services and are reﬂected in eﬀective communication and intercultural interactions (Ortega & Faller, 2011). I draw on an interdisciplinary literature to provide a critical analysis of the debate on cultural competence in the next section. Table 1. Continued.

The stream of literature still coming oﬀ publication lines underscores the popularity of cultural competence in cross-cultural discourse. Within this vast scholarly terrain are two opposing strands of thought, one extol- ling the virtues of cultural competence, the other questioning its eﬀectiveness as a model for cross-cultural work. Since its introduction three decades ago, cultural competence has received a warm reception in ﬁelds as diverse as counselling, education, healthcare, organiza- tional management, psychology, and social work (Furlong & Wight, 2011; Harrison & Turner, 2011; Herring et al., 2013). Cultural competence has been used to study a wide range of issues, including domestic violence (Pyles & Kim, 2006), palliative care (Schim & Doorenbos, 2010), and poverty (Jack & Gill, 2013). Many social workers have embraced cultural competence as a useful entry point for eﬀective engagement with culturally diverse clients in a profession that predomin- antly reﬂects the make-up and values of Western cultures (Herring et al., 2013). Although some authors claim that cultural competence is less dynamic than cultural humility (Ross, 2010), the concept continues to fascinate countless others who perceive it as having both momentum and a progressive intent (Furlong & Wight, 2011). This appeal derives from the apparent practicality of the construct. Few would dispute that cross-cultural social workers, or the service they provide, not be culturally competent. As a construct, cultural competence beneﬁts from a linguistic binary where the intuitive rejection of the reverse, that cultural incompetence is unacceptable, is construed to mean there must be an essence of good sense present. So, although cultural competence is faulted for lacking conceptual clarity, it is hard to criticize as a catchphrase and international ﬂag of convenience (Furlong & Wight, 2011). Recent articulations of cultural competence emphasize the need to question one’s assumptions, beliefs, and biases, and understanding how these views diﬀer from those of other people. They also challenge practitioners to be critically reﬂective of the privileges and power associated with their social location (NASW, 2015), as well as the impact of their personal and cultural identities on their professional practice and the ability to employ culturally sensitive interventions (Hammell, 2013; Pease, 2010). There are also calls to challenge whiteness and Eurocentrism and their stranglehold on social work (Brydon, 2011; de Montigny, 2013). Such formulations seek to transform cultural competence from being perceived as the achievement of a particular skill, implying its completion to being acknowledged as a commitment to and engagement with an ongoing process of learning about oneself and others, built on dynamic experiences over time (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998). They also underscore the potential for cultural competence to evolve as a dynamic construct for transformative social work. Cultural competence is inherently consistent with structural frameworks (Barn & Das, 2015) and can be deployed to promote social change. Danso (2015a) has demonstrated how cultural competence can be integrated with anti-oppressive practices for social justice research. Danso 415 Despite its prominence, many have become disenchanted with cultural compe- tence. A jumping-oﬀ point for many critics is the charge that cultural competence lacks a coherent theoretical foundation. According to Johnson and Munch (2009), the conceptual basis of cultural competence is riddled with inconsistencies and that the construct conﬂicts with core social work concepts or current, standard profes- sional practices. For instance, there are epistemological issues with the question of knowledge and how it is acquired. Johnson and Munch (2009) argue that the construct’s emphasis on a priori knowledge of cultural diﬀerences is limited in terms of its accuracy; it also contradicts the modern social work practice of learn- ing from the client. Evolving, cultural competence encountered what I call construct fragmentation, a term coined to describe the practice of ascribing meanings and interpretations to concepts diﬀerent from their original deﬁnition. Construct fragmentation can cause concepts to lose their originality, dynamism, or radicalism as they travel through diﬀerent literary landscapes and times (Said, 2000). Construct fragmentation has caused disintegration or attrition in the original conceptualization of cultural com- petence, enervated the construct, and opened it to unnecessary attacks. The multi- plicity of conceptualizations (Harrison & Turner, 2011; Horevitz et al., 2013), combined with the proliferation of standards, knowledge, and research about cul- tural competence (Jani et al., 2011; Lum, 2011) and the diﬀerent goals for which it has been used (Hollinsworth, 2013) has generated much controversy regarding the conceptual and methodological value of cultural competence. Construct fragmen- tation undercuts social workers’ ability to (re)invigorate and utilize the cultural competence framework for eﬀective cross-cultural work (Garran & Rozas, 2013). Cultural competence has also been described as a myth (Dean, 2001) because it is not humanly possible to achieve competence at another culture (Johnson & Munch, 2009; Saunders, Haskins, & Vasquez, 2015). The wide diversities and dif- ferences that exist within cultures coupled with the ﬂuidity of culture itself limit anyone’s ability to be competent at another culture. According to Dean (2001), practising cultural competence is even harder in a postmodern era in which culture presents as being individualistic and socially constructed, emergent, and occurring in language. Dean (2001) questions how social workers can become competent at something that is a moving target. Besides, how do we develop a focus that includes ourselves as having diﬀerences, beliefs, and biases that are inevitably active? Rather than trying to achieve the elusive (Saunders et al., 2015), social workers should engage in a continuous process of cultural learning and operate from a not- knowing position and understand clients from diverse cultures. In other words, while knowledge is indispensable, understanding is golden when it comes to eﬀect- ive cross-cultural practice. A stance of informed not knowing can provide a buﬀer against essentialism and stereotyping. Humility and respect are necessary to achieve cultural understanding and develop workable strategies for meeting the goals of a cross-cultural working relationship (Dean, 2001), especially considering the extremely corrosive eﬀects of the historical Western portrayal of racialized cultures as inferior (Hollinsworth, 2013). 416 Journal of Social Work 18(4) Given their modernist heritage, traditional approaches to cultural competence have been castigated for their tendency to view culture through an essentialist, min- imalist lens (Hollinsworth, 2013; Jani et al., 2011; Kirmayer, 2012). Essentialism perceives culture as monolithic, static, and inﬂexible. Applications of cultural com- petence in this mould usually focus on issues of access to the neglect of critical analyses of the impact of social location and power structures on minorities (Hester, 2012). They also rely on the production and propagation of generalizations and the making of grand summary statements about non-white cultures (Furlong & Wight, 2011). Violent and colonizing, such compressions often parade themselves in a cloak of pretended objectivity. Essentialist models of cultural competence normal- ize whiteness instead of problematizing it (Yeager & Bauer-Wu, 2013). Pon (2009) considers cultural competence a new form of racism because it otherizes and devalues non-white cultures without using racist language. Cultural competence fails to acknowledge the sociopolitical mechanisms and institutional processes that produce and perpetuate ethno-racial injustices as a consequence of cultural diﬀerences when compared to the dominant white culture (Hester, 2012; Ortega & Faller, 2011). Cultural competence often focuses attention on promoting productive cross-cultural practice than interrogating sociopolitical and othering processes that exist in both the wider society and social work practice (Nadan et al., 2016). Ignoring or de-contextualizing the sociopolitical limits our ability to challenge the exploitative use of power and the role of whiteness in the institutionalization and perpetuation of oppression. Sociopolitical analyses of culture equip us with tools appropriate for dismantling the systems of oppression that have resulted in ethno-cultural and socioeconomic stratiﬁcation and limited opportunities for people from minority groups (Dean, 2001). By relying on cultural competence for conceptual guidance, social workers have neglected to pursue a transformative agenda and defaulted to positions on practice that reinforce the oppressive status quo (Jani et al., 2011). Our task then is to integrate analyses of structural issues and critical theory into the discourse of diversity and cultural diﬀerences to provide a stronger foundation for transformative social work. Critiquing the critiques Popular concepts rarely escape controversy or scrutiny. What is striking in the case of cultural competence is that many of the criticisms levelled against it lack analytical rigour. As noted, some critics make only passing references to cultural competence in their critiques of the construct; they fail to oﬀer a balanced or persuasive argument as to why cultural competence should be discarded in favour of cultural humility. It is justiﬁable to criticize a construct for its inherent weaknesses, especially if the construct is anachronistic or irrelevant; however, to do so uncritically seems less prudent. I oﬀer a reasoned analysis of the critiques of cultural competence in this section. Subjecting the critiques of cultural competence to a critical analysis, one is imme- diately struck by the absence of the base from which the critiques are mounted. Danso 417 Every concept is the embodiment of its deﬁnition and underlying principles or attri- butes. Typically, the attributes constitute the basis for evaluating the usefulness or disutility of the construct. Many of the conceptualizations of cultural competence do not reﬂect the intention of the original proponents of the construct (Jani et al., 2011), leading to unwarranted criticisms. Consider, for instance, the common deﬁnition of cultural competence as referring to one’s ability to interact seamlessly between cul- tures purely through the broadening of the person’s awareness, knowledge, and skills. Such conceptualizations have often led to operationalizing cultural competence as simply learning about the history and characteristics of diﬀerent cultures (Jani et al., 2011). Surprisingly, the literature is not explicit on who ﬁrst deﬁned cultural compe- tence as referring to the awareness, knowledge, and skills that one must develop to be able to work eﬀectively across cultures. I neither support essentialist formulations of cultural competence (Hollinsworth, 2013; Kirmayer, 2012) nor embrace their colour-blind ideologies and culturally chauvinistic views and interpretations of social reality. What I ﬁnd troubling is the failure of critics of cultural competence to identify which of its myriad deﬁnitions is the target of their criticism. Divergent perspectives can be expected in critiques of cultural competence, given the construct’s wide acceptance in diﬀerent ﬁelds. The problem is that personal assumptions often foster relativist interpretations while conﬂicting standpoints stiﬂe meaningful discourse (Burchum, 2002). For instance, while some have attacked cultural competence for lacking power analysis and exacerbating power relations between practitioners and clients (Garran & Rozas, 2013; Ortega & Faller, 2011; Pon, 2009; Sakamoto, 2007), others (e.g. Hammell, 2013; Pease, 2010) assert that cultural competence encourages cross-cultural workers to be crit- ically reﬂective of the exploitative use of power and privilege that derive from a practitioner’s social location. Consider also the contradiction that cultural humil- ity, the preferred replacement construct, is not an alternative to but rather a strand within cultural competence (Ross, 2010). While Ortega and Faller (2011) describe cultural humility and cultural competence as being complementary, the NASW (2015) considers cultural humility an integral aspect of culturally competent prac- tice. The NASW (2015) recently modiﬁed its deﬁnition of cultural competence and introduced cultural humility in its revised standards to highlight the importance of cultural humility in culturally competent practice. What is the logic in advocating the replacement of cultural competence with cultural humility if the latter is inte- gral to the former? Perhaps the problem with cultural competence is not the con- cept itself, but rather the myriad ways in which diﬀerent researchers and practitioners in diﬀerent places and times have (mis)conceptualized, (mis)under- stood, and (mis)interpreted the concept. Another limitation of the critiques is that critics seem to expect too much from cultural competence. The expectation that cultural competence must necessarily be an omnibus or omnicompetent construct capable of addressing all culture-related or structural problems seems too harsh and unrealistic. That cultural competence has an identity crisis is without question. It is appropriate to consider all relevant variables in the development of a cultural competence model, or any model for that 418 Journal of Social Work 18(4) matter (Ridley, Baker, & Hill, 2001). However, to require of cultural competence tasks its original proponents did not assign or envisage seems naı¨ ve. Does anyone consider anti-oppressive practice (AOP)—social work’s theoretical and methodo- logical ﬂagship—the panacea for all of society’s ills? AOP emerged in the 1980s in Britain (Healy, 2005) as a framework for countering the racism and discrimination ethnic minorities experienced in British society (Barn & Das, 2015; Collins & Wilkie, 2010). AOP has had a remarkable career since its emergence to be accorded central status in social work. Yet, oppression exists even in institutions espousing anti-oppression ideals. Culture is too slippery and untameable a phenomenon for any single framework, however all-embracing, to be able to fully capture or analyze its complex permuta- tions and manifestations. The fact that cultural competence is a product of modernist epistemological and philosophical thought (Furlong & Wight, 2011; Hollinsworth, 2013) seems to be lost on many of its critics; they fail to acknowledge the historical context within which the construct emerged. Like AOP, or the social work profession itself, the development of the cultural competence construct reﬂected the dominant worldview of the day. De-historicizing or decontextualizing a construct not only undermines it, as its context is embedded in its conceptualization, it also weakens critiques mounted against the construct. Such criticisms can wrongly portray the target construct as ineﬀective when it does have considerable promise. Cultural com- petence is a dynamic concept (Burchum, 2002) with great potential for growth in our postmodern, super-diverse world (Boccagni, 2015). Perceiving it as a construct that cannot be adapted for cross-cultural work denies its ﬂexibility. It is also problematic for critics to summarily dismiss the fact that one can be competent at another culture. According to Hook (2014), competency invokes the idea of getting to a certain endpoint where one is considered competent or proﬁ- cient in another culture. It is dangerous to think we have somehow arrived in regard to understanding people who are diﬀerent from us. Arguments such as Hook’s (2014) are common but unfair because they misrepresent the intent of the origin- ators of the cultural competence model. Cross and colleagues (1989), among the originators of the idea of culturally competent practice, deﬁne competence as a practitioner’s capacity to function in a particular way: the capacity to function within the context of culturally diverse and integrated patterns of human behavior as deﬁned by the group with whom the practitioner is working. However, many critics misconstrue the word competence to denote the achievement of a ﬁnite set of skills that enable a practitioner to claim mastery in another culture (Barn & Das, 2015; Lund & Lee, 2015). Cross and colleagues (1989) also acknowledge the strengths inherent in all cultures and how service delivery practices can more eﬀect- ively deal with cultural diﬀerences and diversity issues without violating human rights and dignity. Their oft-quoted deﬁnition of cultural competence neither men- tions nor advocates the cataloguing of cultural information about other ethnicities (Garran & Rozas, 2013), but many critics overlook these important facts. Simple logic can teach great lessons. If a social worker cannot be competent at anything related to cross-cultural work, can she be, say, respectful, sensitive, Danso 419 empathetic, or humble in anything else she does in practice? If, on the other hand, a worker can, and should demonstrate cultural sensitivity in practice, then it should not be impossible for the worker to achieve some measure of cultural competence precisely because some measure of cultural competence is needed to deliver cultur- ally sensitive services. One can claim to be culturally humble and still have a limited, contorted view of diversity and diﬀerence. Any social worker would admit that oppression is destructive. Yet, many social workers consciously or unconsciously engage in oppressive acts on diﬀerent levels almost every day, including committing microaggressions (Hook et al., 2016), or neglecting to con- front the oppressions they witness. Must we get caught up in semantic fanfare when the oppressive structures and lopsided power relations that dominate social work remain unchallenged? Must we rather not expend our energies on confronting the ethnocentric social worker’s biases, stereotypes, and attitudes that cannot embrace diﬀerence or celebrate diversity? However tenable, the anti-competence stance of the critics of cultural compe- tence promotes a reductionist view of competence; it ignores the fact that there are levels of competence (Nassar-McMillan, 2014), or that the term itself is relative and should be so understood. Consider an individual who used to be a novice but is now an accomplished musician; she has become skilful over time. Critics also overlook the fact that competence is context-dependent (Lyngstad, 2013). What may be seen as incompetent in one context may not be so regarded in another (Guthrie, 2009). Analyses of a social worker’s level of cultural competence cannot ignore the context in which the worker–client relationship developed. Without careful consideration of context, social work practice would be ineﬀective in our ever-changing, super-diverse world, but it would be disastrous in a social order that operates systematically to reproduce or sustain the very conditions and arrangements we are striving to transform, and which make marginalized groups more vulnerable and captive to the totalitarian, colonizing eﬀects of systems of oppression. Missing these important facts, many critics misinterpret competence to mean having expert knowledge about another culture. Although being competent may not be permanent or considered an endpoint in itself, it is still possible to achieve a measure of competence over time. The word ‘‘competence’’ is just an indicator of abilities, skills, and knowledge (NASW, 2015) that can be developed or improved over time for eﬀective cross-cultural practice. Cross-cultural competence is acquired through two contemporaneous processes: acculturation and deculturation. Acculturative practices enable both the worker and the client to adapt to each other’s cultural values, beliefs, and practices in mutually respectful ways while at the same time discarding, through deculturation, negative aspects of their respective cultures that could jeopardize the working relationship (Danso, 2015b). Cultural competence has been achieved as long as the working relationship is constructed to produce desired outcomes or is deemed to have met the client’s needs. Cultural competence can be seen as a way of relating to or interacting with others cross-culturally. It seeks to build eﬀective relation- ships, which can be achieved by acknowledging and overcoming the cultural 420 Journal of Social Work 18(4) diﬀerences and biases of the individuals involved in the relationship (Danso, 2015a; Ridley et al., 2001). In its original formulation, cultural competence was seen as a framework that could create opportunities for individuals and organizations to establish eﬀective interpersonal and working relationships that supersede cultural diﬀerences (Cross et al., 1989). By getting ﬁxated on the word competence, many critics fail to critically examine culture, the primary element in the cultural competence linguistic binary (Horevitz et al., 2013; Ridley et al., 2001). The role or impact of culture is often treated as unproblematic in many of the critiques. Yet, between competence and culture, the latter is obviously the more amorphous term in the construct. Consider Johnson and Munch’s (2009) focus on the word humility and their claim that ‘‘the mere changing of the term ‘competence’ to ‘humility’ would instantly convey expect- ations of openness, respect, sensitivity, and life-long self-critique that are required for enlightened practice’’ (p. 229). Many would disagree with overly simplistic assertions. Words matter and words have inﬂuence, but words do not, by them- selves, magically create change or make anyone humble or eﬀective when working across cultures. In the world of transformative social work, words are meaningless unless they are concretized into actions that produce change. It is deliberate human action, not mere utterances, that creates change. In brief, the call by critics to cast cultural competence into the dustbin of analyt- ically useless diversity concepts seems disingenuous. Many would agree that the idea of cultural competence has served social work considerably well for three decades. Cultural competence has done a lot to bring important issues of diﬀerence to the fore in social work (Garran & Rozas, 2013). So, despite the sharp criticisms, one thing seems quite certain: cultural competence will continue to shape social work practice, education, and research in very profound ways. Inhabiting a global, super-diverse world, do we need more or less cultural competence, or none at all? Cultural humility: Conceptual backstory Enter cultural humility, exeunt cultural competence! Such is the clamour of many who feel dissatisﬁed with the latter construct. The concept of cultural humility emerged in the late 1990s in the medical ﬁeld (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998), and is promoted as the contemporary conceptualization of culturally sensi- tive healthcare (Foronda et al., 2016; Kools et al., 2015). Interestingly, before cultural humility has established itself in cross-cultural discourse, it is already embroiled in a controversy over who coined the term (see Dong & Chang, 2014a, 2014b; Murray-Garcia & Tervalon, 2014). Like cultural competence, cul- tural humility originated in America, and both concepts seem more prominent in American social work than elsewhere. Cultural humility was developed as a tool for training physicians in the deliv- ery of culturally appropriate medical care (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998; Yeager & Bauer-Wu, 2013). It entails a lifelong process of commitment to self- reﬂection and analysis, to redressing power imbalances in the physician–patient Danso 421 relationship, and to developing mutually beneﬁcial, nonpaternalistic advocacy partnerships with individuals and communities. Cultural humility emphasizes self-critique and respect between healthcare providers and clients; it is crucial to improving health outcomes for oppressed populations (Kools et al., 2015). Practitioners using a cultural humility model are expected to challenge the institu- tional forces and processes that shape the practitioner–client relationship (Fisher- Borne et al., 2015). Hook (2014) sees cultural humility as having two components: intrapersonal and interpersonal. The intrapersonal dimension involves practitioners developing awareness of the limitations in their ability to understand a client’s worldview and cultural background. Cultural humility at the interpersonal level takes an other- oriented stance towards the client, marked by respect and openness to the client’s worldview. Fisher-Borne and colleagues’ (2015) model of cultural humility embo- dies three elements: institutional and individual accountability, lifelong learning and critical reﬂection, and mitigating power imbalances. The authors allege that accountability diﬀers markedly from the sense of mastery that characterizes cultural competence models. Institutional and individual accountability is presented as working together to create long-term change. Ongoing learning and critical self-reﬂection are vital to mediating the movement from accountability to shifting power imbalances. Self-reﬂection enables cross-cultural workers to assess the impact of the environ- ments, circumstances, and events they encounter to integrate them in some way, and to develop eﬀective interventions. Considering the challenges involved in crit- ical self-reﬂection, practitioners should be aware of the factors that shape their self-analyses and self-critiques (Ross, 2010) and make eﬀorts to overcome the identity-related, cultural, and sociopolitical conditions that make self-reﬂexivity diﬃcult and emotionally draining (Katila & Merila¨ inen, 2013). The ﬁnal element in Fisher-Borne and colleagues’ (2015) cultural humility model is the individual and structural power imbalances, which the authors say are malleable when power is recognized and leveraged. Many of the factors that need careful consideration in self-reﬂexivity for culturally humble practice are key in the deﬁnition of cultural competence (Chiu et al., 2013). For instance, culturally humble practice requires a respectful stance irrespective of the particularities of a culture, however, to be able to demonstrate respect for another culture, one must ﬁrst develop awareness or suﬃcient knowledge of that culture. A repackaged AOP Whatever its appeal, cultural humility has yet to excite widespread interest in social work. To date, only a few social work articles (Abell et al., 2015; Duntley-Matos, 2014; Fisher-Borne et al., 2015; NASW, 2015; Ortega & Faller, 2011; Schuldberg et al., 2012) focus explicitly on cultural humility. That scholarship on cultural humility is almost lacking in social work 20 years after its emergence may be due to the fact that the core elements of the construct are not new to the discipline. 422 Journal of Social Work 18(4) Years before the concept of cultural humility emerged, its fundamental ideas had already been developed and now form a bedrock of anti-oppressive social work theory and practice (Healy, 2005). The bourgeoning scholarship on cultural humil- ity in healthcare may suggest that AOP is not as widely known in that ﬁeld as it is in social work. Remarkably, the social work scholarship on cultural humility (e.g., Abell et al., 2015; Ortega & Faller, 2011) has promoted the concept as if it was entirely novel in the profession. If cultural humility is nothing more than AOP by another name, what distinguishes it as an innovative framework to supplant cul- tural competence or be hailed as a new diversity paradigm? The term ‘‘cultural humility,’’ that is, the juxtaposition of the two words, may be new to some but the construct’s deﬁning elements are not revolutionary in social work. Principles such as critical self-reﬂection, respect for diﬀerence, reducing power diﬀerentials, building partnerships, and learning from clients (Ben-Ari & Strier, 2010; Fisher-Borne et al., 2015; Healy, 2005; Johnson & Munch, 2009; Kools et al., 2015; Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998) are long-established tenets in anti-oppressive social work practice and education (Barn & Das, 2015; Brydon, 2011; Samson, 2015). In fact, AOP delivers more than what cultural humility could potentially oﬀer. Ortega and Faller (2011), apparently the ﬁrst social workers to focus on cultural humility, acknowledge that much of what cultural humility proposes is consistent with traditional social work practices. What then is the jus- tiﬁcation for promoting cultural humility as a new diversity paradigm in social work? The call to embrace culturally humble practices is not new in social work. Almost two decades ago, Dean (2001) and others emphasized the need for humility, respect for diﬀerence, and self-knowledge to achieve cross-cultural understanding and facilitate the development of culturally appropriate social work interventions. Strengths and limitations of cultural humility According to Ortega and Faller (2011), the strengths of cultural humility include its capacity to free practitioners from claims of possessing expert knowledge about other cultures. This liberating dynamic enables practitioners to meaningfully engage clients, inclusive of their cultural diﬀerences, in service delivery. It also places the practitioner in a learning mode as opposed to maintaining power, con- trol, and authority in the working relationship, especially over cultural experiences about which the client is far more knowledgeable. Besides freeing practitioners from the constraints of cultural stereotypes and bounded knowledge about speciﬁc cultures, cultural humility also encourages them to learn from the clients and communities they work with about both their past and current experiences, as well as learn from the perspectives and interpretations that other people give to their personal experiences (Ortega & Faller, 2011). This way, practitioners could potentially develop a better understanding of the unique personal and cultural identities of the people they serve. Many advocates seem to have supported the cultural humility idea for its seman- tic appeal and therefore failed to subject it to critical analyses. The literature review Danso 423 suggests that the present work is perhaps the ﬁrst attempt to provide any critique of cultural humility. Previous works, including the very few ones by social workers, have embraced cultural humility a priori as an unproblematic construct for cross- cultural practice. All have sung its praises but none has exposed its shortcomings. Cultural humility sounds linguistically appealing but lacks conceptual clarity and deﬁnitional unanimity among its advocates (Fisher-Borne et al., 2015; Foronda et al., 2016; Hook, Don, Owen, Worthington, & Utsey, 2013). Even the term humility is not clearly deﬁned. The absence of a deﬁnition makes it diﬃcult for cross-cultural practitioners to build on the hope that humility inspires. Humility may be important in order to develop a strong bond of engagement in cross- cultural relationships where the practitioner and the client may have a strong ten- dency to value their own perspective (Foronda et al., 2016; Hook et al., 2013). However, without a clear deﬁnition of the term humility, how could practitioners know they were being culturally humble in their service delivery practices? The challenges to be encountered when applying cultural humility cannot be overlooked. Practising cultural humility can be very daunting, especially in situations where the worker and the client’s core values, worldviews, and goals conﬂict (Foronda et al., 2016; Hollinsworth, 2013; Hook, 2014). Scholarship on cultural humility is not clear on how the concept can be operationalized for cross- cultural practice. It is not enough to simply describe cultural humility; the desired outcomes and steps needed to achieve the goals of culturally humble practice must be clariﬁed (Ridley et al., 2001). Muddying the waters is the tendency for some authors to confuse or conﬂate cultural humility with cultural competence. For instance, Alsharif (2012) asserts that cultural humility is a key tool for developing an eﬀective framework for cul- turally competent practice. Ross (2010) also presents cultural humility as being more dynamic than cultural competence, implying that the two constructs are dis- similar. Yet, Ross states in the same article that cultural humility is embodied in cultural competence, and has three foci: knowledge, attitudes, and skills. These same elements are associated with cultural competence models. A fundamental assumption of cultural humility is that being culturally humble automatically translates into respect for diversity (Hester, 2012; Johnson & Munch, 2009; Kools et al., 2015; Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998). The fact is that one must intentionally develop awareness and a desire to value diversity and diﬀerence in order to demonstrate authentic humility. Many social workers from the domin- ant culture may not embrace diversity (Fisher-Borne et al., 2015) although they may oppose the use of diﬀerence to oppress minorities. Deliberate acts of self- analysis that move social workers beyond tolerating diﬀerence to developing a capacity for minority empowerment are needed to engage humbly in cross-cultural work (Ross, 2010). Cultural humility is also limited in its tendency to focus on micro-level practice. While promoting respect for diﬀerence and acknowledging the need to address power imbalances in service delivery (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998; Yeager & Bauer-Wu, 2013), these considerations tend to be limited to the clinical or 424 Journal of Social Work 18(4) organizational context. The disproportionate focus on micro-level contexts sug- gests that macro-structural issues risk being minimized or ignored. The utility of cultural humility as a cross-cultural pedagogical and research tool remains to be proven (Alsharif, 2012; Foronda et al., 2016; Yeager & Bauer-Wu, 2013). The lack of a well-deﬁned methodological approach to culturally humble practice and research may be attributed to the lack of conceptual clarity around cultural humility. Twenty years after its introduction, work on cultural humility has mostly been literature reviews; empirical studies to provide evidence for eval- uating the research potential and pedagogical or practice utility of the construct are generally lacking (Hook et al., 2013; Ross, 2010). The lack of a coherent frame- work, the paucity of empirical research, and the fact that the ideas undergirding cultural humility have previously been developed for anti-oppressive practice make the call to replace cultural competence with cultural humility both unrealistic and disingenuous. By contrast, many empirical studies have been done and measure- ment scales and training tools developed for culturally competent practice (Both & Neﬀ, 2008; Chiu et al., 2013). However, like cultural humility, methodological frameworks for guiding culturally competent research are also lacking (Danso, 2015a; Yeager & Bauer-Wu, 2013). Conclusion Very few diversity concepts are more popular than cultural competence. Evolving, cultural competence encountered a cacophony of conceptualizations that have resulted in scathing criticisms against the construct. Many healthcare practitioners and social workers want to see cultural competence replaced with cultural humility. However, critical analysis suggests that neither political correctness nor semantic appeal gives cultural humility a utilitarian edge over cultural competence. Cultural humility lacks conceptual clarity and a coherent framework; even the term humility is not clearly deﬁned. Neither does it provide explicit guidelines for cross-cultural pedagogy, research, or practice. The underlying principles of cultural humility are already embedded in AOP—a major reason why cultural humility has not attracted much attention in social work. While some criticisms of cultural competence are justiﬁed, many of the limitations associated with the concept are not inherent to the concept itself but rather derive from the construct fragmentation cultural compe- tence has experienced. For instance, the assumption that cultural competence must be an omnicompetent construct seems naı¨ ve; it hampers eﬀorts at improving the construct for anti-oppressive practice. Super-diversity is recasting intercultural relations in remarkable ways in our postmodern world. Therefore, re-visioning established, potentially useful cross-cultural tools to address the challenges posed by this diversity is a far more productive undertaking than simply jettisoning the tools, especially when no viable alternatives are oﬀered. Adapting dynamic con- cepts such as cultural competence in light of current realities would help move social work to a new, enlightened level of relevance in working with diversity and diﬀerence. The call to challenge institutional and structural oppression and Danso 425 the accompanying feelings of privilege and internalized oppression (NASW, 2015) suggests that cultural competence can evolve as a dynamic tool for transformative social work. A comprehensive adaptation of cultural competence that incorporates AOP (Danso, 2015b) and intersectionality (Garran & Rozas, 2013; NASW, 2015) in cross-cultural education and practice can enhance the construct’s eﬀectiveness.
