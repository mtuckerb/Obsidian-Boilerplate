Fin d lo ve. 💛 Welcome to The A wesomely A wkward Social Club! B efore we jump into breakout rooms, I want to offer a few quick thoughts to help you get the most out of tonight—and to remind you that this is a space where being a little awkward is more than okay. 1. A wkwardn ess Isn ’t a Pro blem—It’s Part o f B ein g Human If you feel nervous, overthink your words, or worry about saying the “right” thing, you’re not alone. Everyone feels awkward sometimes—it just means you care. The key is to keep showing up anyway. 2. C o mmun icatio n Is Less A bo ut What Yo u Say an d Mo re A bo ut Ho w Yo u Make Peo p le Feel You don’t need to be charming or clever. People remember how comfortable, respected, and seen you made them feel far more than they remember your exact words. 3. A ctive Listen in g Is a Sup erp o wer Instead of thinking about what to say next, try really listening. Nod, reflect back what you heard, or simply say, “That’s interesting—tell me more.” People light up when they feel truly heard. 4. C o n fiden ce D o esn ’t Mean B ein g Lo ud—It Mean s B ein g Real You don’t have to fake being outgoing or ultra-social. Confidence grows when you’re honest about who you are and show up anyway. B e kind to yourself in the process. 5. Lead with C urio sity an d C o mp assio n Everyone here is navigating something—just like you. If you go into each breakout room with the goal of getting to know someone, not impressing someone, you’ll have a better time—and so will they. *Happy Birthday, Ayesha A weso mely A wkward So cial C lub – C o mmun ity Guidelin es To help everyone feel comfortable and supported, here are a few ground rules we ask all participants to follow: 1. B e Resp ectful o f Everyo n e’s Sp ace an d Exp erien ce We’re all here to grow, connect, and have real conversations. That only works when we treat each other with kindness, patience, and mutual respect. 2. Listen Mo re Than Yo u Talk Let others finish their thoughts without interrupting, and make space for quieter voices. A ctive listening is just as important as sharing. 3. Keep It C o n fiden tial What’s shared in breakout rooms stays there. This is a trust-based space—please don’t repeat personal stories or comments outside the group. 4. No Un so licited A dvice o r Feedback Unless someone specifically asks for it, focus on listening and relating, not fixing or judging. 5. Keep It A p p ro p riate an d In clusive No flirting, sexual comments, or discriminatory language of any kind. If someone makes you uncomfortable, let a host know immediately. 6. Let A wkward B e Okay This is literally the Awesomely Awkward club! You don’t need to be polished or perfect. A wkward moments are welcome here. 7. On e Perso n , On e Mic Please don’t dominate the conversation or speak over others. If you tend to talk a lot, be mindful. If you tend to stay quiet, we’d love to hear your voice. 8. Use First Names On ly To help protect privacy, we encourage using first names only—no last names, personal contact info, or social media handles unless it’s mutual and agreed upon outside the group. 9. Keep C ameras On When Po ssible We know not everyone is always comfortable on camera, but seeing faces helps build connection. If you can, please leave your camera on during group discussions. 10. B e Yo u, No t Yo ur Perso n a You don’t have to impress anyone here. This is a space for authenticity, not performance. 🌟 Theme #1: Everyday Magic D escrip tio n (fo r the Meetup /Even t Page o r at the start o f the sessio n ): In this session of The Awesomely Awkward Social C lub, we’re focusing on the small things that make life feel a little more magical—even when things are messy, awkward, or uncertain.
