My meditation time was a time to re-ground, and check in with myself. I really enjoyed the \"thoughts are bubbles\" concept. Historically I have used a roundabout visual with thoughts being cars (that was touched on in one of the readings too). The bubbles seem a little less challenging and aggressive to me. I liked the cloud imagery as well. I have done a lot of cloud spotting, and this felt both familiar and relaxing.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
