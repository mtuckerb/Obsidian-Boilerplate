Engaging this question presented epistemological and political challengesA My challenge was to invite. into the terrain of intersectionality’s theorizing. a heterogenous group of readers who had limited encounters with one anotherA How might I write to intellectual activists who were already contributing to the ever? growing knowledge base and practices of intersectionality. but who also rarely identiﬁed their work as ‘‘theoretical’’? How might I craft the arguments in a–ST for scholars who brought preconceived disciplinary deﬁnitions about what constituted ‘‘theory’’ to their reading of my text? Writing this book would have been far easier had I narrowed the scope of my audienceA Some readers who engaged the book would ﬁnd its ideas too abstract whereas others would think they already knew what it wasA Focusing on how these heterogenous social actors used intersectionality offered analytical tools for managing these deﬁnitional dilemmas (Collins. ´]a‘,A Avoiding ﬁxed deﬁnitions of intersectionality enabled me to avoid elevating any one use over othersA Drawing on the philosophical tenet from pragmatism that ideas gain meaning through use. I identiﬁed three characteristic uses of intersectionality – namely. as a metaphor. as a heuristic. and as a paradigm – that provide a conceptual foundation for intersectionality’s heterogeneous practicesA Throughout the text. I frame intersectionality through the kaleidoscope of these cognitive tools. from the simplicity of a metaphor. through the utility of a heuristic device. to the structured nature of paradigmatic thinking that guides a ﬁeld of study. to the possibility of an explanatory social theory that engages the issues that most concern scholars and practitioners of intersectionalityA These cognitive tools invite readers into both my text and the ﬁeld of intersectionality without privileging one entry point over anotherA These multiple cognitive entry points into a–ST parallel multiple entry points into intersectionality as a form of critical inquiry and praxisA Surveying the broad \u0002 ´]´a The Author(s,. under exclusive licence to Springer Nature LimitedA a–ﬁ]?ıˆa– Iontemporﬂry aoliticﬂl ’heory VolA ´]. ¨. ’ˆ]–ﬁ´‘ ’ˆ¨ Critical Exchange scope of how people used intersectionality solidiﬁed my choice of six core substantive constructs that in varying combinations would be recognizable to intersectionality’s practitioners. namely. relationality. power. social inequality. social context. complexity. and social justiceA This focus on use also grounds my selection of four guiding premises of intersectional projects. namely.

This interpretive framework that organizes ntersectionality as –ritical Social Theory offers an elastic structure for engaging the contributions in this Critical ExchangeA As I initially read each contribution.

Turkey. Norway. the US. and Spain,. academic disciplines (political science. policy studies. gender studies. sociology,. career stages. institutional locations. and racialYethnicYreligious backgroundsA This heterogeneity shapes how each author entered the text and informs her choice of topic. questions. and analysesA How could this one symposium hope to achieve a uniform voice from such disparate contributions? Intersectionality requires a new way of reading that focuses less on the differences between these contributions. either?or frameworks that produce mono? categorical thinking of race or gender. and more on intersectionality’s bothYand relational thinkingA Standard ways of reading that seek to mine intersectionality for what a reader can take from it give way to dialogical engagement that respects what ’ˆ– \u0002 ´]´a The Author(s,. under exclusive licence to Springer Nature LimitedA a–ﬁ]?ıˆa– Iontemporﬂry aoliticﬂl ’heory VolA ´]. ¨. ’ˆ]–ﬁ´‘ Critical Exchange each has to offer to the project of intersectionalityA Such thinking searches for points of connection between each contribution and intersectionality as a ﬁeld as well as connections among the contributions themselvesA Reading these contribu? tions as being in dialog with one another through the lens of intersectionality’s key concepts as well as its paradigmatic premises. provides a different interpretive frameworkA Just as the ideas of intersectionality are interconnected and ﬁnd new meaning in intersectionality’s metaphoric meeting place as an exchange of ideas. so too do the distinctive views of people who are sufﬁciently grounded within intersectionality contribute to its critical ethos by offering critical analyses of their ownA Thus. Gonzaga da Silva kicks off the Critical Exchange by attempting to trace the evolution of my conceptualization of intersectionality over timeA Ergun writes from within the ﬁeld of translation studies and reﬂects on the role of translation in enabling both intersectional analyses and the formation of transnational solidaritiesA Furseth provides us with a persuasive argument about the mutually illuminating relationship that can develop between the sociology of religion and the scholarship in intersectionalityA In her contribution. Bond then invites us to think about political violence both as a tool and a response to intersecting axes of oppressionA Last but not least. Martı´nez?Palacios takes up a double challenge¸ to propose that intersectional thought can support both social agents in a practice of therapeutical self?socio?analysis that can enable them to build literacy regarding their own complex social positionalities and can help public policy makers committed to social justice and the sustainability of human ﬂourishingA Patricia Hill Collins Pntersectionﬂlity, then ﬂnd now I ﬁnish writing this text at a moment in history when there is an ongoing worldwide spread of a new disease called COVID?aˆA From December ´]aˆ. when the outbreak in Wuhan.

I will trace the changes in Collins’s intellectual development of her conceptual apparatusA Naturally. the concern with complex inequality is not exclusive to this scholarshipA In Brazil. for instance. Heleith Safﬁoti published a mulher na sociedade de classes in aˆ’ˆ. including references to different roles played by white and black women in the reproduction of capitalism in BrazilA But while Safﬁoti’s (´]a¨, objective was to understand how differently racialized women were impacted by capitalism. a central preoccupation of Collins’ scholarship. since Outsider Within (aˆı’,. is with how the intersection of power and knowledge is connected to the oppression of the many by the fewA That means Collins’ work is ﬁrmly anchored in a sociology of knowledge that speaks against the so?called scientiﬁc neutrality and objectivity of those who claim authority to speak for the otherA It also underscores the importance of marginalized forms of knowledge that challenges mainstream ideological framing of people in groupsA This is a concern shared by other scholars who were publishing about feminist epistemology in the United States¸ Nancy Hartsock and her book Money, Sex, and Power (aˆı¨,. Sandra Harding and Merrill Hintikka’s collective work ’iscovering Reality (aˆı¨,. Sandra Harding’s The Science Question in ıeminism (aˆı’,. and Donna Haraway Situated Knowledges (aˆıı,. to name a fewA Such scholars engaged in an effort to redeﬁne the making of science. foregrounding the existence of women’s standpoint or situated knowledge. and showing how objectivity was supposed to be understood in dialog with the Western canon of philosophy and the sociology of knowledgeA More than claiming the existence of a Black women’s standpoint. though. Collins was invested in the production of ‘‘facts and theories about the Black female experience that [could] clarify a Black woman’s standpoint for Black women’’ (aˆı’. pA a’, – and that is a distinctive trait that will mark her work. not only Outsider Within. but also ´lack ıeminist Thought a few years laterA The choice was not random. as the author clariﬁes in the ﬁrst pages of ´lack ıeminist Thought¸ Oppressed groups are frequently placed in the situation of being listened to only if we frame our ideas in the language that is familiar to and comfortable for a dominant groupA This requirement often changes the meaning of our ideas and works to elevate the ideas of dominant groupsA In this volume. by placing African?American women’s ideas in the center of analysis.

Being that serves as foundation for the Being is actually an ‘‘epistemicideA’’ In contrast to these scholars. Collins’ approach goes beyond the identiﬁcation of oppressive entanglements and offers us a way of transcending group?speciﬁc politics based upon a Black feminist epistemology – and here lies the relevance of intersectionality¸ as Black women sit at the intersection of two powerful systems of oppression. race. and gender. understanding this position opens up the possibility of identifying and understanding other cross?cutting oppressions. enabling a move to transform realityA In Outsider Within. Collins did not use the term ‘‘intersectionalityA’’ Instead. she speaks of the ‘‘interlocking nature of oppression’’ (aˆı’. pA aˆ,A The author does not claim the novelty of the observation – to the contrary. she afﬁrms that ‘‘the interlocking nature of race. gender. and class oppression is a second recurring theme in the works of Black feminists … While different socio?historical periods may have increased the saliency of one or another type of oppression. the thesis of the linked nature of oppression has long pervaded Black feminist thought’’ (aˆı’. pA aˆ,A ‘‘Intersectionality’’ will be found in ´lack ıeminist Thought a few years later. which reads¸ ‘‘Subsequent work aimed to describe different dimensions of this interconnected relationship with terms such as intersectionality (Crenshaw. aˆˆa, and matrix of domination’’ (pA aı,A Although some readers mistakenly point to Collins as the creator ‘‘intersectionality.’’ the scholar herself makes an express reference to Kimberle´ Crenshaw. a Black legal scholar in the United States who was also doing some research on the intersection between race and sexA The second edition of the book references Mapping the MarginsA ntersectionality, dentity Politics, and Violence against Women of –olor (aˆˆa,, but this paper was published after the ﬁrst editionA So. it is reasonable to conclude that Collins had contact with Crenshaw’s previous work ’emarginalizing the ntersection of Race and SexA a ´lack ıeminist –ritique of antidiscrimination ’octrine, ıeminist Theory and antiracist Politics (aˆıˆ,A In both works. Crenshaw applied intersectionality more as an analytical tool to show how Black women were in a disadvantaged position when it came to how courts framed and interpreted the stories of plaintiffsA Both in Outsider Within and ´lack ıeminist Thought. intersectionality will be also an analytical approach. but Collins enriches our understanding thereofA In the former. the ‘‘interlocking nature of oppression’’ indicates a need to change the scope of previous investigations and investigate how systems of oppression are interlinked (Collins. aˆı’. pA ´a,A In the ’ˆı \u0002 ´]´a The Author(s,. under exclusive licence to Springer Nature LimitedA a–ﬁ]?ıˆa– Iontemporﬂry aoliticﬂl ’heory VolA ´]. ¨. ’ˆ]–ﬁ´‘ Critical Exchange latter. the term is to be read in conjunction with ‘‘matrix of domination.’’ which would explain how intersecting oppressions (both particular and structural. disciplinary. hegemonic, are actually organized (´]]]. pA aı,A Further in the book. Collins explains how different aspects of Black women’s lives operate as sites of intersectionalityA As she argues. the investigation of Black women’s experiences of pornography. prostitution. and rape. for instance. allow us to understand how powerful groups act to regulate Black women’s bodies and how ‘‘connections between sexual ideologies developed to justify actual social practices and the use of force to maintain the social order’’ (´]]]. pA a¨–,A At the time. Collins was taking seriously the task to reclaim Black women’s voice and their power to tell their own storyA In the ´]a]s. after the term was popularized and was widely incorporated not only in scholarship but also by social movements all over the world. Collins took upon herself the task of reviewing and exploring the deﬁnitions of intersectionality at work in these contexts – something evident both in ’eﬁnitional ’ilemmas (´]a‘, and Key concepts (´]a’,A In ’eﬁnitional ’ilemmas, Collins reviews intersectionality as a ﬁeld of study. as an analytical strategy. and as critical praxisA One year later. Collins and Bilge’s book Key –oncepts (´]a’, will build on the previous analysis¸ intersectionality as an analytic tool. and as critical praxis and inquiryA Collins remarks that. while it is possible to note the coexistence of a general consensus about the contours of the idea of intersectionality. there is also a massive heterogeneity of deﬁnitions – with positive effectsA For instance. the appropriation of the term by social movements allowed some aspects to blossom and others to fade away (´]a‘. pA ﬁ,A Moreover. the widespread adoption of intersectionality by both scholars and practitioners alike revealed a connection between knowledge and remedying social inequalities in a fashion that made sense for their social justice project – what Collins understands as critical praxis and inquiryA Notably. the expression ‘‘matrix of domination’’ that previously captured how intersecting oppressions are organized (´]]]. pA aı, is nowhere to be foundA Instead. Collins and Bilge now combine intersectionality with ‘‘domains of power.’’ in what resembles a downgrading of the concept in her theory¸ ‘‘power relations are to be analyzed both via their intersections. for example. of racism and sexism. as well as across domains of power. namely structural. disciplinary. cultural. and interpersonalA The framework of domains of power provides a heuristic device or thinking tool for examining power relations’’ (´]a’. pA ´ˆ, Despite admitting the risk that the very popularity of intersectionality causes it to lose meaning (´]a‘. pA ´,. by then the scholar seemed to think it was too premature to deﬁne theoretical boundaries for the concept (´]a‘. pA aa, – a position that clearly changed by the time her latest book was publishedA There she proposes that ‘‘[i]f intersectionality does not clarify its own critical theoretical project. others will do so for it’’ (´]aˆa. pA ¨,A In ntersectionality. the primary concern about the interconnection between knowledge and power. as well as the interlocking relation \u0002 ´]´a The Author(s,. under exclusive licence to Springer Nature LimitedA a–ﬁ]?ıˆa– Iontemporﬂry aoliticﬂl ’heory VolA ´]. ¨. ’ˆ]–ﬁ´‘ ’ˆˆ Critical Exchange between different systems of oppression is still there. but Collins transcends previous categories that marked her work to put forward the contours of a wider theoretical model and develop it as a critical social theory (Collins. ´]aˆa,A The expression ‘‘matrix of domination’’ will be used only once in an example that involves a comparison of the United States and BrazilA It is most deﬁnitely no longer a key conceptA In fact. Collins expressly states that ‘‘I analyze power relations not by emphasizing domination. but rather by developing the concept of intellectual resistance and exploring intersectionality’s connections to it’’ (´]aˆa. pA a],A Instead of focusing on how oppression works and is organized.

Kindred and my Turkish translation of it. Yakın [‘‘CloseYAkinYIntimateYSigniﬁcant Other’’]. published in Turkey in ´]aˆA Kindred tells the story of an African?American woman. Dana. who ﬁnds herself travel back and forth in time between aˆﬁ’’s California. where she lives with her white husband. and a slave plantation in aıa‘’s Maryland. where she ﬁnds her ancestors among both slaveholders and enslaved peopleA In fact. it is one of those ancestors that involuntarily calls Dana back in time so that she can save his life every time he ﬁnds himself in a life?threatening situation¸ the plantation owner’s son. Rufus. who grows up to be the plantation owner himselfA He rapes Alice – Dana’s enslaved great grandmother – and in doing so. becomes Dana’s great grandfatherA Kindred is woven around Dana’s navigation of slavery as a black woman and her dilemmas of saving Rufus for the sake of her family’s continuation. trying to survive the brutal reality of slavery. staying in solidarity with the other slaves. yet becoming complicit in the very system that is designed to dehumanize them allA Kindred is an intersectional story of racial. economic. and gendered oppression and survival. but it is not just Dana’s storyA It is also America’s storyA And it is Octavia Butler’s genius to merge these two stories in a plain yet arresting narrative and situate the unsuspecting science?ﬁction reader in the plot as one of the shareholders of that great American painA What happens to this very American story when it leaves the locality of the US and travels to another place where that unﬁnished past of patriarchal slavery does not exist? This is a compelling. yet slightly misleading question because while it seems like an exclusively local story. Kindred in fact depicts the US as a transnational space by not only focusing on the trans?Atlantic slave trade (and its continuing heritage across the globe,. but also highlighting the interconnected nature of the various manifestations of genocidal logic citing. for instance. the indigenous genocide in the US. the South African apartheid. the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. and the Lebanese civil war – hence. relationally reconceiving the national conﬁguration of the US as a transnational doingA As the protagonist Dana brings these transnational connections into her growing critique of the intersectional operations of race. gender. and class violence in the locality of the US. she also invites the reader to question the legitimacy of the US (and their allegiance to it, and reimagine systematic oppression as well as resistance and liberation beyond the oppositional \u0002 ´]´a The Author(s,. under exclusive licence to Springer Nature LimitedA a–ﬁ]?ıˆa– Iontemporﬂry aoliticﬂl ’heory VolA ´]. ¨. ’ˆ]–ﬁ´‘ ﬁ]¨ Critical Exchange parameters of the nation stateA Hence. by treating racism. capitalism. patriarchy. nationalism. colonialism. and imperialism as locally and globally intersecting systems of violence. Butler’s novel highlights the signiﬁcance of coalitional and intersectional resistance across bordersA In that regard. we might consider Kindred as giving an account of a black feminist standpoint that is simultaneously intersectional and transnationalA My Turkish translation of Kindred has sought to expand that intersectional and transnational web of relations that the novel claims by facilitating the book’s travel to Turkey. whose distinctive geohistorical landscape has witnessed its own locally and transnationally procured and contested violent intersectionalitiesA In order to help facilitate such geoYpolitically connectionist readings. I introduced Kindred to the Turkish?speaking reader by adding a brief preface to it where. by citing Audre Lorde (aˆı–. pA –¨,. I ﬁrst portrayed translation as a political project of sharing and expanding ‘‘the feminist word’’ across borders¸ ‘‘And where the words of women are crying to be heard. we must each of us recognize our responsibility to seek those words out. to read them and share them and examine them in their pertinence to our livesA That we do not hide behind the mockeries of separations that have been imposed upon us and which so often we accept as our ownA’’ I. then. added¸ The second reason why I translated Kindred is the gratitude I feel for black American feminists whose theories. stories. poems. activisms. and friendships have always stimulated. nurtured. and transformed me in my own feminist journey and given me hope and strength to resistA So. the translation you are reading aims to ensure that the words of black feminists live on and blend in our own words. despite the world order that operates against themA Translating the works of women writers. especially women of color writers. and enabling their encounters with different readerships across languages is not only an intervention into the male?dominant. colonial publication world. but also an attempt of facilitating cross?border feminist exchange and solidarity … As you read this translation.

I will provide a brief outline of how religion is treated in the work of Patricia Hill CollinsA The aim is to highlight different areas where intersectionality and the sociology of religion might beneﬁcially learn from each otherA Collins has not developed a systematic view of religion. but religion appears as a topic in her workA Early on. her approach of viewing domination as a matrix led her to include religion as one form of oppressionA In both ´lack ıeminist Thought (´]]ˆY´]]], and ntersectionality as –ritical Social Theory (´]aˆ,. Collins talks about religion in general. and discusses Christianity in more detail. especially the Black Christian churches in the UASA As I will attempt to show. she tends to move between using feminism’s binary approach to religion and overcoming this binaryA Feminist theorists. including Collins. are deeply critical of several forms of binaries that are genderedA Nevertheless. feminist theory often operates with dichotomous thinking when discussing religious womenA Its binary approach frames religious women as either subordinated or submissive to patriarchy or empowered if they subvert the existing tradition and offer resistanceA Despite Collins’ criticism of binary categorizations. she often relies on feminism’s dichotomous approach to religionA She emphases one side of the binary. the oppressive elements in Christian teachings on womenA In ´lack ıeminist Thought she describes how religion was used to justify slavery and construct homosexuality as devianceA Likewise. she outlines how UASA Black women often had subordinate roles in Black civil society organizations. including the Black churches. and that these organizations largely ignored Black women’s issues (´]]]Y´]]ˆ. ppA a]. a´. ˆ‘. a–]. a‘],A Collins also relies on the other side of the feminist binary by ﬁ]’ \u0002 ´]´a The Author(s,. under exclusive licence to Springer Nature LimitedA a–ﬁ]?ıˆa– Iontemporﬂry aoliticﬂl ’heory VolA ´]. ¨. ’ˆ]–ﬁ´‘ Critical Exchange focusing on how UASA Black women changed religion by subverting itA The women used male?run churches to advocate issues that concerned them (´]]]Y´]]ˆ. pA ˆ,A They questioned the scriptural interpretations preached by male ministers on their ‘‘rightful place’’ and challenged the perception of their role in the Black churchesA Thereby.

Collins and other African?American feminists opposed such a limited view of freedomA For them. freedom implied being able to form families. since the long history of slavery. genocide. and racism had prevented family formationA According to Mahmood.

Just as many intersectional theorists have tended to list religion as one of many differences without offering a more profound analysis. there has been a tendency in the sociology of religion to undertheorize the intersections of race. ethnicity. gender. sexuality. and religionA This led Wood (´]]’, to call for ‘‘Breaching Bleaching¸ Integrating Studies of ‘Race’ and Ethnicity with the Sociology of ReligionA’’ Wood’s concern is that when several dominant theories of contemporary religion. such as secularization theory. ignore race and ethnicity. white religion is constructed as the ‘‘normal’’ form of religion and dominant theories become applicable to white religion onlyA Furthermore. when race and religion are studied. there is a tendency to focus on single dimensions and not analyze the intersection of race and ethnicity with other dimensions. such as gender. social class. structural. and political developmentsA Since the aˆˆ]s. there has been a growth in sociological studies of religion that include race and ethnicityA For example. studies of post?aˆ’‘ immigrant religious communities in the UASA addressed ethnicity. social class. and gender (Ebaugh and Chafetz. ´]]a Foley and Hoge. ´]]ﬁ,. although few discussed race and the various ways in which these communities were affected by racial ideologies and structuresA This stands in contrast to studies of Islamophobia and antisemitism. which often relate the construction of and prejudices against Jews and Muslims to racialization processes (see Meer. ´]a¨,A There has also been an increase in studies of racial attitudes and practices among white. conservative Protestants and racial diversity in Christian congregations (Emerson and Smith. ´]]] see Dougherty et al?. ´]´],A A critique against these studies is that they provide individualistic and religious cultural forms of explanation. and they fail to recognize how religious racial attitudes intersect with racism. structural inequalities. gender. and the growth of the political right in the post?civil rights eraA In other areas. intersectionality has had a profound impact on the sociology religionA As with general sociology. these contributions often concern gender and sexualityA In the aˆı]s and aˆˆ]s. a considerable body of multi?disciplinary literature examined religion. gender. and sexualityA Many studies put women at the center of analysis. and this kind of feminist inquiry implied a reorientation in the sociology of religion. going beyond religious institutions to include religious practices and cultural discourseA Collins’ work on intersectionality inﬂuenced. for example.

Page and Yip (´]´a, apply intersectionality in their edited volume on religion and sexuality that include case studies from across the worldA These studies highlight how religion is a complex phenomenon that both can produce inequality and stigmatization and be a resource that challenges other oppressionsA Intersectionality provides an important contribution to the sociology of religion in its focus on multiple and complex intersections of various dimensionsA While there is a tendency in current research to either focus on religion and race. or religion. gender and sexuality. intersectionality might beneﬁt the sociology of religion by giving attention to the various ways in which religion is linked to a wider set of dimensions. such as race. ethnicity. social class. gender. sexuality. politics. and nation. and the ways in which these dimensions intersectA This brings us to the question of how the sociology of religion might inﬂuence intersectionalityA First of all. the sociology of religion might contribute to taking religion more seriously. or as Gilkes argues. ‘‘religion needs to be placed in the foreground of questions’’ because ‘‘in any society characterized by the durable inequality of race. religion matters’’ (Gilkes. ´]a]. pA –aı,A The sociology of religion also has a lot to offer in understanding the complexities of religionA While the dominant discourse in feminist research and intersectionality presents a relatively monolithic and binary understanding of religion. Collins criticizes the binary view of reason and faith towards the end of ntersectionality as –ritical Social Theory (´]aˆa. pA ´ı¨,A For her. their assumed oppositional difference is a hindrance for exploring how they are related. and this binary aligns with other binaries that create constraints for Black women’s knowledge. which intersection? ality challengesA Furthermore. the sociology of religion can provide a wider understanding of religionA When intersectional analyses focus on religion as oppressionYsubversion. there is a tendency to emphasize religious doctrines and ideologiesA In \u0002 ´]´a The Author(s,. under exclusive licence to Springer Nature LimitedA a–ﬁ]?ıˆa– Iontemporﬂry aoliticﬂl ’heory VolA ´]. ¨. ’ˆ]–ﬁ´‘ ﬁ]ˆ Critical Exchange ntersectionality as –ritical Social Theory.

I aim to further develop two arguments that Collins brieﬂy introduced while theorizing violence as a ‘‘saturated site of intersecting power relations’’ (Collins. ´]aˆa.b. pA ´¨ı,A First. I explore the possibility that episodes of violence represent points at which the conﬂuences of systems of oppression are not only particularly visible but also particularly vulnerable to dismantlingA Second. in dialog with the common conceptualization of violence as a social problem. I probe the possibilities of violence as a solution to the social problem of dominance itselfA The embodied experience of collective violence as both a tool of and a response to domination ought to be at the forefront of any analysis of political order and changeA An intersectional framework to understanding violence not only supports such an approach but also may in fact require itA The intersectionality framework allows for a more complete accounting of the mechanisms through which violence organizes inter? and intra?systemic power relations by centering its fundamental relationalityA While subject and object experiences of violence alike describe the imperialist impulse that elevates domination as a political ideal. the scalability of violence illuminates this as much at the person level as in higher?order aggregations. like war among states or rebellion within themA Even one of the largest?scale structural representatives of the political status quo. the Weberian state – the government of which is expected hold a monopoly on the legitimate use of force within its borders and with respect to its population – is simply one composite representation of the innumerate power relationships within and across human communitiesA The state serves also as a logic and a technology of violence that increasingly derives power from individuals’ willingness and abilities to distance themselves (physically and psychically, from the harms that they commit against othersA Notwithstanding its focus on systems rather than merely acts of oppression. the lens of intersectionality can greatly help us resist the pull toward abstracting away agents’ responsibility for violence when parsing its structural implicationsA For instance. consider Collins’s claim that political domination ‘‘seems hege? monicAAAwhen violence becomes naturalized and normalized to the point where it becomes invisible’’ (pA ´¨ˆ,A Acknowledging violence as a saturated site of intersecting power relations allows us to push forward into a recognition that. at the point of hegemonic consolidation. status?quo domination may not be truly achieved unless all of its implications – the employment of violence included – enjoy legitimacy only in the image of the otherA This logic seems succinctly summarized \u0002 ´]´a The Author(s,. under exclusive licence to Springer Nature LimitedA a–ﬁ]?ıˆa– Iontemporﬂry aoliticﬂl ’heory VolA ´]. ¨. ’ˆ]–ﬁ´‘ ﬁaa Critical Exchange in Charles Tilly’s oft?cited aphorism. ‘‘War made the state and the state made war’’ (aˆﬁ‘. pA –´,. as in it. violence and its perpetrators construct themselves in each’s image. along with the normative and institutional logics that sustain themA Returning to Collins’ claim. I submit that the invisibility of violence that she describes as a mark of a maturing domination complex only becomes so precisely because its agents have assumed a normalizing anonymity that masks their individual responsibility while eliding it to the system’s persistenceA This is convenient. because in the power?saturated site of violence. only those who are visible can be assigned responsibility for it. because only they can be held to practical account for the empirical implications of their behavioral choicesA However. when we can identify the system conﬁgurations that support domination and also their individual arbiters. we chip away at the hegemony of hierarchy as an orienting norm and move toward self?determination as a fully formed politics of collective control insteadA At the person level. it is critical to acknowledge individual?level decision making in the production of violence because it is as much kinesthetic as it is kineticA For stewards of status?quo politics and their challengers. the observable act of violence is just one of many possible penultimate steps in an iterated process of political expression that involves the very human conditions of both experience (iAeA. being and doing, and cognition (iAeA. knowing,A For example. when an object is launched in the midst of a riotous crowd. we are able to observe in that moment a crude operationalization of not only deliberations over whether arming has become feasible – let alone necessary – to someone. but also the discriminating moments by which that object is perceptually and actually purposed as a weaponA This moment of energy release constitutes a penultimate step because. again. the value of violence resides in its inter?subjectivity¸ For what meaning does violence have apart from the experiences that construct and communicate its ‘‘display’’ (Fujii. ´]aﬁ,? Once the physical act is complete. can the tool or the perpetrator be neutralized. or will it always retain the threatening patina of having once been fashioned as a weapon by the hands and minds of someone in particular?

French bodyA Recently. fatphobia was used by Daria Marx and Eva Pe´rez?Bello (´]aı, to explain how functional diversity. gender. age. social class. and race intersect in bodies that are seen as obese and do not enter. quite literally. into the instruments needed for public policies to be carried outA So. via the metaphor of ‘‘marked body.’’ in this case. fat. black and belonging to a woman. it is possible to think about a collective viewpoint on mental health that can serve to assess public health policies. using participatory tools (participatory workshops. planning cells. meetings about future scenarios. etcA, rooted in the multiple experiences of day?to?day discriminationsA In this regard. the goal would be to think about how the practitioners of participatory and deliberative democracy who are going to design public policies could make use of the intersectional metaphor of the ‘‘marked body’’ in order to make it clear that the social agents at whom these policies are directed are affected by different matrices of domination in an embodied and objectivized wayA In terms of using metaphorical thought in order to decipher oneself and also to be able to transcend. collaboratively. these readings about oneself. metaphors that contain an idea of intersectionality may have a therapeutical use. oriented towards a life that is worth living. crucial in moments of personal crisis. when there is a need for self?literacy. whether as part of a participatory policy or as a process of self? careA In this regard. metaphors may come mediated by an external expert agent in intersectionality from the community or may arise from the individual’s own creativityA In the speciﬁc case.

By focusing on what happens within the space of dialog. Ergun identiﬁes one core methodological challenge facing intersectionality as it moves toward being a critical social theoryA Dialogical engagement is impossible without translation. and the act of translation occurs across differences of powerA Signiﬁcantly. by situating the theme of translation within the need for intersectionality to expand the universe of dialogs within a transnational context. Ergun provides compelling reasons why it is important to do soA Inger Furseth’s chapter also engages intersectional border spaces that require skills of translation. namely. cultivating dialogical engagement between intersec? tionality and ﬁelds of inquiry that lie outside its bordersA Intersectionality is currently in conversation with multiple disciplinary and interdisciplinary ﬁeldsA But where are the missing dialogs with ﬁelds that also speak to intersectionality’s questions and concerns? In a–ST’s closing chapter. I ask. is it possible to have intersectionality without social justice?

I emphasize violence as a tool of domination. positing that violence constitutes a dense transfer point among systems of power that potentially highlight the intersectional nature of power itselfA Because violence has long been a catalyst for political activism among Black. Indigenous. women. Latinx. LGBTQ and similarly subordinated groups. analyzing and responding to violence have been the subject of considerable critical inquiry and praxisA Yet my analysis does not consider the ways in which subordinated groups may also develop mechanisms of violence to counter political dominationA Nonviolence is but one political strategy for resisting the violence of intersecting power relationsA Bond suggests that the visibility of violence not only creates possibilities for political domination but also for political resistanceA Notably. conceptualizing violence as inherently intersectional facilitates theorizing political resistance to violence through an intersectional lensA Jone Martı´nez?Palacios provides a provocative use of intersectionality’s possibilities. offering an honest. embodied analysis of what it means to do intellectual and political work in the challenging space of intersectional inquiry and praxisA Using intersectionality as a metaphor. she positions two ostensibly separate ways of knowing in close proximity. the subjective world of individual experience that organizes everyday life. and the objective world of social structure that operates under rules that lie outside human agencyA Martı´nez?Palacios presents an autoethnographic analysis of her emotional. intellectual. and political struggles to make sense of her own well?being during a global public health crisis (her contribution was completed early on in the ´]´] pandemic,A But she also offers a window into the value of metaphors for creating public policies whose goal is social justice and the sustainability of lifeA Juxtaposing the artiﬁcial distance between subjective and objective ways of knowing creates space for new insights. questions. and possibilities that are signature features of intersectional analysisA For example. Martı´nez?Palacios brings the emotional labor that accompanies much intersectional work into the center of her contribution. sharing with readers the emotional costs of caring about social justice. and the sustainability of lifeA Usually this emotional labor is hidden within theoretical analysis yet here Martı´nez? ﬁ´´ \u0002 ´]´a The Author(s,. under exclusive licence to Springer Nature LimitedA a–ﬁ]?ıˆa– Iontemporﬂry aoliticﬂl ’heory VolA ´]. ¨. ’ˆ]–ﬁ´‘ Critical Exchange Palacios offers a holistic view of intersectional theorizing. one that incorporates the personal. the political. and the intellectual as a pathway to building more robust political communitiesA The scope and breadth of these contributions in this Critical Exchange remind me how much is at stake in getting intersectionality’s journey toward becoming a critical social theory rightA As an ever?growing. shape?shifting intellectual project that moves in tandem with decoloniality. intersectionality offers a conceptual lingua franca for people to engage one another about shared concerns regarding emancipation and equalityA Signiﬁcantly. intersectionality is also a language of discovery. whose commitment to dialogical engagement provides an alternative to a knowledge regime that upholds colonial conquest and neoliberal commodiﬁca? tionA Eschewing narrow pathways into social theory that invite historically subordinated people into seemingly ﬁnished Western disciplines. intersectionality has been participatory and democratic since its inceptionA Making intersectionality less so. all in the name of prematurely elevating its status as a social theory. undermines its critical potentialA This symposium provides a glimpse of the possibilities as well as the work that remains to be doneA Intersectionality is a discourse of social change. of hope and. as these authors remind us. of possibilityA Patricia Hill Collins Rote a The author would like to thank Jean?Nicolas Bach.
