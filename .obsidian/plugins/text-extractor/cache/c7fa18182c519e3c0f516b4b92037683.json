We applied a policy-led review of local legal frameworks and global best-practices of shoreline public access management, followed by several descriptive research strategies to develop four public access strategies that connect the district with its shoreline. The developed strategies can inform other cities with competing population growth pressures, in providing the health benefits of equitable public shoreline access. The strategies raise new management issues such as shoreline public access loca- tions, capital and operational financing, and ecological consequences. 1.  Introduction Currently, around 40% of the world’s population—about 2.4 billion people—live within 100 km of coastal areas (UN 2017). These populations are growing faster than those in non-coastal areas as they provide favored locations for trade and industry and options for recreational activities (Creel 2003). However, because of this rapid increase in population and development, the availability of public access to shorelines has declined in many coastal cities and urban areas globally (Pogue and Lee 1998; Mackintosh 2011; Grydehøj 2015). A growing body of literature highlights the health benefits of having physical access to coastal shorelines, lake waterfronts, rivers, and canals, which facilitate increased physical leisure activities (Owen et  al. 2004; Pasanen et  al. 2019), the promotion of healthy behavior, and reduction of stress levels (Roe et  al. 2019). Moreover, having access to shorelines can encourage beach walking and swimming, (Maguire et  al. 2011) and provide higher levels of experienced psychological restoration, place attachment, © 2022 taylor & Francis group, llC CONTACT nawaf alhajaj nalhajaj@kau.edu.sa assistant professor at the Department of landscape architecture, Faculty of architecture and Planning, King abdulaziz University https://doi.org/10.1080/08920753.2022.2078175 KEYWORDS Public access; physical access; strategies; public open space; shoreline 326 N. ALHAJAJ AND C. HENDRIGAN and identification (Subiza-Pérez, Vozmediano, and Juan 2020). High levels of physical activities, such as walking, jogging, and exercising are linked to the accessibility of large and attractive public open spaces (POS) such as public parks and playgrounds (Giles-Corti et  al. 2005). POS is defined as outdoor areas designed for public recreation such as waterfronts, shoreline, or inner city parks (Alhajaj 2014). However, despite its health benefits, several international urban areas in North America (Davidson and Entrikin 2005; Mackintosh 2011; Kim, Lyu, and Song 2019) and the Middle East (Al Ansari 2009; Reclaiming the Sea 2014; Kheyroddin and Hedayatifard 2017), for exam- ple, still have inadequate public access to shorelines. There are two types of public access to shorelines: physical and visual (Department of Ecology of State of Washington [DESW] 2017). Physical access is the most common type, offering walking trails or promenades, bridges, floating docks, jetties, and boat ramps; visual access depends on being able to view a shoreline or some of its elements (DESW 2017). Both public access types will be investigated in this study. Making cities livable through appropriate access to recreational opportunities for residents is a key concern for many countries (Department of Infrastructure and Transport 2012). In this respect, Saudi Arabia has initiated its Quality-of-Life Program (QLP 2020), which is part of its 2030 Vision—to make its cities livable. The QLP aims to ensure that at least three major Saudi cities qualify in the top 100 of the world’s most livable cities by 2030; the City of Jeddah is among these. To achieve this goal, QLP applies two aspirational concepts—livability and lifestyle—that have a direct link to the built environment of Saudi cities. Livability highlights the necessity of providing the minimum standard of green spaces per capita as recommended by the World Health Organization, enhancing the walking habits of residents, and reducing the prevalence of diabetes and traffic deaths. Lifestyle emphasizes an increase in physical activities by improving accessibility to sports infrastructure and minimizing social isolation (QLP 2020). The City of Jeddah is the largest coastal city and the second-largest urban area in Saudi Arabia, with a total population of around 4 million (Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs [MOMRA] 2019a). However, this city suffers from several significant urban issues (for e.g., lack of POS and an efficient transportation system) (Jeddah Municipality 2009; UN-Habitat 2018; MOMRA 2019a) that minimize its chances of being among the top livable cities. Its population is expected to increase from 4 million in 2020 to 7.6 million by 2033 (MOMRA 2019a), most of whom will be directed by Jeddah’s Sub-regional Plan to other urban areas, such as the North Obhur District (NOD), that have a lower population density. The current population of NOD is around 50,000 residents, however, it is expected to reach 500,000 in the future due to its proximity to the shoreline (Saati 2020) and Jeddah’s high population growth (MOMRA 2019a), making it a major site for urban intensification—a mega-district. NOD will be the place to live for the desired quality of life as envisioned by the policy, but with no public access to its shoreline. Overcoming the inaccessibility to the shoreline of the residential urban area, at a scale commen- surate with the needs and population growth of the NOD, is the motivation for this study. NOD’s shoreline was privately developed before the establishment of Jeddah’s first corniche (a public long stretch of seaside promenade) in 1980 (Buchan 1980), currently CoASTAL MANAGEMENT 327 known as Jeddah’s Waterfront. This shoreline is privately owned, having been developed as private beach resorts for weekend use before the preparation of Jeddah’s first plan for shoreline development in 1973 (Al-Shahrani 1992; Daghistani 1993). The shoreline of NOD has also been occupied by a variety of private buildings and undeveloped fenced lands since the early 1970s (Daghistani 1993), however, development and urbanization result in impacts such as morphological changes and ecological degrada- tion. (Basaham et  al. 2006; Gheith and Hariri 2010; Kitto and Sambhu 2012). Due to extensive privatization, NOD’s shoreline continues to be inaccessible to the public. Seafront activities can only be reached by driving to the southern bank of Sharm Obhur—which is characteristically narrow and insufficient to serve users (Jeddah Municipality 2009)—or to other City of Jeddah waterfronts that also suffer from traffic congestion (Mandeli 2019). This places additional pressure on the urban mobility of the city, which is already inadequate due to the unavailability of an effective public transportation system and poor road safety (UN-Habitat 2018). Currently, NOD is not linked to any public transportation mode; people need to drive via the Madinah Freeway or South Obhur Highway to reach other parts of Jeddah. Providing public access to NOD’s shoreline is a major priority for its residents as claimed in social media (Sabbagh 2018), as there is no provision for POS in the dis- trict nor equity of shoreline public access when compared to Jeddah’s other residential districts, which have public access to their nearby shorelines. Jeddah currently lacks significant POS provision, allocating only 2 m2 per capita (MOMRA 2019a). Jeddah’s current waterfronts are the most important recreational POSs (Daghistani 1993; Jeddah Municipality 2009; MOMRA 2019a) because the city has no large inner urban parks and only provides few small neighborhood-scaled parks (Alhajaj 2014). This study investigates potential strategies to provide public access to NOD’s shore- line and create POS. Therefore, we define public access as representative physical and visual access for all community members to significant portions of the local shoreline up to the water’s edge for recreational activities. This study contributes to the global experience of living in fast-growing cities, particularly for those cities whose residents are without the physical and mental ben- efits of shoreline parks. Specifically, this study is the first to explore the possibilities of providing public access along the coast of Saudi Arabia, particularly to NOD’s shoreline. This study is organized by first elucidating the laws and codes regarding shoreline development and access in Saudi Arabia, then looks broader to some of the best-practices globally as precedent. This is followed by a study area of NOD, presenting the findings of the analysis, and suggesting strategies to overcome the deficit in the shoreline public access for residents of the fast growing, but disconnected, mega-district. 2.  Saudi legislation and land use planning for shorelines 2.1.  Current protection law and public shoreline access Currently, the Saudi law does not permit purchase of new private lands (on the water edge) along shorelines. Established in 1999, the law requires a 400 m setback from the water’s edge—for the purpose of public recreation and national security, to protect its 328 N. ALHAJAJ AND C. HENDRIGAN coastlines from future privatization (MOMRA 2017). However, no law addresses the blockage of existing shorelines by private properties constructed officially on the water edge prior to 1999. The building codes of existing undeveloped private lands on shorelines are subject to the local plans and regulations set by their city municipalities. Additionally, in 1999, due to significant damage to the ecology and changes in the coastlines of many urban shorelines, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture established a new regulation, which they continue to apply till date on the existing private and public properties constructed on the water edge, to protect coastlines from sea encroachments associated with urbanization. This regulation states that land filling or cutting along coastlines or shorelines, including adding permanent or temporary structures on the sea such as wharfs or wave breakers, are prohibited on any scale and by any agency or individual. Land can only be reclaimed by obtaining official approval after fulfilling Saudi environmental regulations, standards, and criteria (Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture [MEWA] 2019). Fines are applied to developments that breach the law (MEWA 2022). In the absence of laws addressing the existing shorelines blocked by existing private properties, land acquisition (an expropriation system or eminent domain) is the only means to provide public benefit in the country, but stipulations apply. The acquisition of private lands through purchase can only be used i) for the benefit of public utilities and services; ii) to extend existing governmental sites in approved planned areas; and iii) for creating approved governmental projects if there are no designated sites. Acquisition only occurs if these projects are approved in the official budget of a gov- ernmental sector (Bureau of Experts at the Council of Ministers [BECM] 2020). The land acquisition process begins with an approval decision provided by a responsible minister, head, or council of a government department and attaching a copy of the project plan to be built to the decision. Next, all local municipalities and other com- petent authorities in the project area are officially informed about this decision includ- ing publishing it in the official newspapers of the area and a copy of the decision is posted in the project owner’s headquarter and in the project area. The owners of selected private properties for acquisition are compensated (cash) for the decision (entire or partial land acquisition) for public benefit, including for the land, buildings, structures, trees, or greenery (within the land area), based on the market price at the time of acquisition. Compensation can be also in the form of a new land to be granted in another area if the owner agrees (BECM 2003). 2.2.  Jeddah’s local plan and NOD’s shoreline The majority of NOD’s shoreline currently has a building mass on it, within the legal bounds of the survey, with set land uses, insightfully Jeddah has reformed the devel- opment codes by which future development occurs. Jeddah’s Local Plan and Building Codes (JLPBC) (MOMRA 2019b) subject new land development of three hectares or more along NOD’s shoreline to compliance. Mixed-use developments, including resi- dential, commercial, administrative, and recreational, with a floor area ratio of 2.4 and development footprints not exceeding 30% of the land area, are encouraged. The height of new buildings should be gradually stepped down from the main road/street toward CoASTAL MANAGEMENT 329 the sea. The following four regulations in these building codes are of importance to the present study as they are related to providing public access to the shoreline: i) 50% of the shoreline must be kept free of buildings and any vertical obstacles to maintain the continuity of visual access from the main road/street to the sea; ii) 30% of the land strip area abutting the water edge—up to 15 m in width—must be main- tained as a public beach and not be blocked by property owners; iii) new developments must create pedestrian public access at least 10 m wide along one side to connect the main road/street with the preserved public beach area along the shoreline water edge; and iv) public parking areas must be created near the pedestrian public access (Figure 1). The review of JLPBC highlights the current regulations applied to prospective private developments and how they should be developed without blocking public physical and visual access to the NOD shoreline. However, JLPBC omits specific regulations and procedures dealing with the existing developments that are built on the water edge and block the shoreline, such as beach resorts and residential properties, which have occupied a significant land area of NOD’s shoreline since a long time. Additionally, future private residential developments, which will be built on existing undeveloped private lands located on the water edge are also excluded from these building codes. There is an issue with JLPBC in addressing the current lack of public shoreline access. Thus, it highlights the need to review the best-practice for providing public access in fully built-up areas to solve the current issue. 3.  Best-practice for public shoreline access Many potential strategies and programs can be utilized to provide public access to shorelines in fully built-up urban areas, such as land acquisition (Pogue and Lee 1999; Duff, James, and LaBate 2016). Land acquisition can be implemented by exercising the power of eminent domains (state governments) with payment of compensation. It can also be through a town or state’s purchase of the entire land or an easement on a particular part of a land from a willing seller to ensure public access for a long Figure 1. noD’s shoreline building codes diagram (adapted and translated from MoMRa 2019 b, p. 66). 330 N. ALHAJAJ AND C. HENDRIGAN period of time. The issue with land purchasing is the cost. However, if such a step is considered vital for a city, the gained benefits will justify the cost as has occurred in several cases (Duff, James, and LaBate 2016). Another best-practice strategy to provide public shoreline access is the use of gov- ernmental actions. Tax breaks (taxes reduced to compensate for the public access granted) or liability breaks (whereby the local government, rather than the landowner, assumes liability for the costs of damages and accidents) can be useful incentives to compensate private property owners for the public access to shoreline easements via a small portion or strip of their lands (Duff, James, and LaBate 2016). Another example of governmental action is the strategy of a household levy that is paid to the city in addition to annual homeownership taxes. This levy is only for purchasing land along shorelines from private landowners who are willing to sell at a fair market value, or from other tiers of the government once their use has been terminated, (for e.g., ex-military bases) to create new shoreline public parks (Capital Regional District [CRD] 2020). Although this strategy may be considered an additional financial burden, it is effective in increasing public access provision and quality (Blizzard and Mangun 2008). Additionally, existing public streets—which tend to be perpendicular to the water’s edge—can be identified and redeveloped to improve or increase the limited access to shorelines in existing urban areas (Doody and Booth 2006; DESW 2017). Where developments exist, regulations can be an effective tool to gain public access to shorelines. Applying a permit condition (for e.g., easing shoreline public access, limiting building size, and providing parking) for both redevelopment and new projects is another effective form of regulation (Vickey n.d.). Here, public access can be a tool to manage and protect marine sensitive habitats (Hui and Gorkovenko 2022). Additionally, public access rights can be established when land occupation changes through the issuance of licenses or leases (Doody and Booth 2006). Another form of regulation is through dedication of the right-of-way land by incurring fees or offering easements for public access from a street or highway to shorelines (County of Hawai’i 1996). Generally, public access policy cannot be effectively implemented without suf- ficient regulatory enforcement, organizational capacities, and political will (Kheyroddin and Hedayatifard 2017). Applying planning tools—such as the development of general shoreline management plans—is another best-practice strategy (Pogue and Lee 1999). It can also include mapping and collection of data on existing shoreline public access. However, this strategy has some limitations such as the inability to measure the intensity of access and actual uses along shorelines (Thompson and Dalton 2010). On the other hand, application of planning tools in addition to public outreach and the implementation of local regulations can assist in protecting existing public access to shorelines and highlight the public’s future requirements at a provincial level (Mackintosh 2011). Technical assistance—including site planning and design, construction, maintenance, and research—can help protect and improve public access to shorelines. Through systematic research, it can also rediscover the right-of-way and confirm legal rights of existing public access and uses that have been lost or neglected in district or city record books (Duff, James, and LaBate 2016). Legal expertise as one form of technical assistance can help assess the right-of-way status. Engineering expertise as another form of technical assistance can support incorporation of public access into the design CoASTAL MANAGEMENT 331 and development of shoreline projects. Both types of expertise are considered important and cost-effective (Pogue and Lee 1999). Public-outreach educational programs can encourage individual and community stewardship of existing public access to shorelines (Mackintosh 2011). Public programs are necessary to educate the community about the importance and challenges of public access while finding opportunities to increase its provision (Mackintosh 2011; Kheyroddin and Hedayatifard 2017). Funds can also be raised for improving the public access facilities and availability (Pogue and Lee 1999). Presently, the land acquisition strategy (eminent domains) is used in Saudi Arabia to provide public benefit. Such a strategy can be implemented to provide public access, however stipulations apply as highlighted in section 2.1. Moreover, JLPBC—a form of planning tools— is being used as a strategy to solve shoreline public access issues but only in future developments as explained in section 2.2. In summary, this review highlights the broad strategies currently applied to provide public access to shorelines in urban areas that are privately owned (including the ones used in Saudi Arabia) and establishes a solid evidence-base of the useful practices to be considered when developing strategies for providing public access to NOD’s shoreline. 4.  Case study – NOD 4.1.  The study area We selected NOD’s urban shoreline as a case study of a publicly inaccessible area to investigate potential strategies that can improve public access. This shoreline is part of the planned mega-district of North Obhur with its approximately 82 km2 urban footprint and is physically defined by the Madinah Freeway in the east, Sharm (creek) Obhur in the south, Red Sea shoreline in the west, and King Saud Highway in the north. NOD’s shoreline extends for 55 km (water edge length), with widths varying between 50 m and 850 m. The shoreline is separated from NOD by Prince Abdullah Alfiasal Street (PAAS). Less than half of the length of NOD’s shoreline forms the north bank of Sharm Obhur, a natural inlet with sheltered waters, which separates NOD from Jeddah’s urban areas and has been used for sea recreational activities (Daghistani 1993). The remaining shoreline is open to the Red Sea (Figure 2). 4.2.  Research approach The leading research question in this study is: RQ1: How can public access to NOD’s shoreline be provided? Applying descriptive strategies, including field observations, and studying or ana- lyzing secondary descriptions (e.g., maps, aerial photographs, reports, previous studies), is an effective method for producing new knowledge without requiring complex analysis. This knowledge, when accompanied by a specific literature review, can effectively develop urban environment solutions (Deming and Swaffield 2011). Thus, we applied two investigating stages, with the use of multiple descriptive strategies to answer this study’s research question. 332 N. ALHAJAJ AND C. HENDRIGAN 4.2.1.  Stage one: identifying urban issues affecting public access to NOD’s shoreline We first reviewed Jeddah’s current Local Plan Atlas to understand the proposed land uses along NOD’s shoreline and identify any public land allocated for future recreation or the improvement of public access to the district’s shoreline. Between 1 June and 8 August 2020, we also studied Google Maps (GM) and Google Earth Pro (GEP) maps of NOD’s shoreline and conducted several field observations by driving the length (22.7 km) of PAAS, from the Sharm Obhur upstream point to the far endpoint of King Saud Road in the north-west, to identify the completed development areas of the shoreline and their exact functions. We then used the QGIS tool—open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software—supplemented by GM and Open Street Maps, to create the map of the current shoreline’s land uses and calculate their respec- tive land areas. We also searched for any public accesses provided to the water edge, such as public streets or designated walkways through or between the currently devel- oped areas. We also checked if the water’s edge can be viewed from PAAS and beyond the private developments’ external walls and fences. Finally, we investigated opportu- nities along the PAAS, such as pedestrians and the cycling infrastructure, to connect NOD’s residents with the shoreline. 4.2.2.  Stage two: identifying land uses altering NOD’s shoreline Previous studies (Basaham et  al. 2006; Gheith and Hariri 2010; Kitto and Sambhu 2012) confirmed the negative impact of urbanization on NOD’s shoreline ecology but omitted investigating the types of land use that altered the shoreline the most. We investigated this to establish solid empirical evidence, to justify two of the proposed strategies for providing public access, creating new shoreline parks, and repairing the damaged ecology of the shoreline. Figure 2. (a) noD location to Jeddah; (B) noD’s shoreline (study area) and the district physical boundaries. CoASTAL MANAGEMENT 333 Using the QGIS software, we employed the Landsat historic satellite imagery of NOD’s shoreline for the year 1965 obtained from the Saudi Geological Survey, and, with GEP 2020, established a baseline of the approximate historic shoreline to identify subsequent modifications along the shoreline. We chose 1965 due to an absence of urbanization and the normal condition of marine ecology. This process identified all land filling beyond the original shoreline, as well as inland cutting and backreef zone cutting—the process of cutting into the seabed and reef to either create a channel for boat access to a wharf or to deepen a shallow sea area for swimming. We also visited several private developments such as resorts and private residences to validate data showing backreef cutting gathered from GEP. Using QGIS, we then calculated the overall extent of land filling permanently extending into the sea, backreef zone cutting, and inland cutting according to the land use. This was to identify the land use types that had a negative impact on NOD’s shoreline and based on this evidence we pro- posed multi-function strategies that can promote public access and ecological resto- ration. However, we did not investigate the legality of these man-made interventions as this was outside the scope of this study. After analyzing data collected by the identified research methods in both stages, we used this empirical evidence to develop four strategies for providing public access to NOD’s shoreline based on different levels of intervention. Our strategy development was further enhanced by applying the Saudi legal frameworks (section 2.2) and the best-practices for shoreline access (section 3). Figure 3 provides a summary of the study approach and research methods. 5.  Findings 5.1.  Current land uses on NOD’s shoreline Findings show that there are no designated POSs along NOD’s 780-hectare shoreline. The major constraint to shoreline public access is the extremely high occupancy by private residences (52%, 406 hectares), followed by private undeveloped fenced land (23%, 176 hectares), beach resorts (17%, 134 hectares), undeveloped land under public ownerships (6%, 46 hectares), NOD’s Marina (1%, 11 hectares), and fish farms (1%, 7 hectares). There are also 217 private wharves extending out over the water from private residences or resorts, providing private visual and sensory access to the sea. All currently undeveloped public lands have no access to the water’s edge (Figure 4). 5.2.  Public access to NOD’s shoreline A major constraint is the unavailability of physical public access to NOD’s shoreline and its water’s edge from PAAS due to the obstruction of the shoreline by private developments. Another constraint is that less than 1% (around 80 m) of the entire shoreline length (22.7 km) is visually accessible where the public utility lot of the upstream point of Sharm Obhur is connected to the major concrete channel for stormwater management. The remaining length of the shoreline strip is visually inaccessible from PAAS due to the use of solid walls, opaque fences (3–5 m height), and high vegetation buffers along the front setbacks of most private residences and 334 N. ALHAJAJ AND C. HENDRIGAN beach resorts. Even when passing the solid front walls of many developments, the design and arrangement of buildings preclude visual accessibility of the shoreline (Figure 5). Figure 3. study approach and research methods. Figure 4. types and percentages of land use along noD’s shoreline. CoASTAL MANAGEMENT 335 The shoreline is separated from NOD by the PAAS (6 to 10 lanes), excluding side- walks or cycling networks that connect the shoreline strip with the district. Most of the front setbacks outside beach resorts’ properties along PAAS are used as informal parking areas for visitors and staff. Parts of the first and second traffic lanes (on the beach resorts side) are also used as informal parking strips along the PAAS because most resorts fail to provide sufficient parking spaces for their visitors within their perimeters (Figure 6). 5.3.  Land uses altering NOD’s shoreline Findings indicate that major modifications have been made along NOD’s shoreline by private urbanization, particularly land filling (132 hectares) and the cutting of backreef zones (113.3 hectares). Land filling over the seabed accounts for approximately 132 hectares (17%) of the total 780 hectares (Table 1). Private residences have the highest rates of land filling, backreef cutting, and inland cutting by 68.8, 81.8, and 20.5 hect- ares, respectively. By contrast, public undeveloped lands have no impact on the physical layout of NOD’s shoreline or its ecology (Figure 7). 6.  Strategies for creating public access to NOD’s shoreline Four strategies are proposed—with differing intervention intensities—to minimize the unavailability of public access to NOD’s shoreline. Each development strategy follows the spirit of one or more of the Best-Practices outlined in section 3 to answer the question of how public access to NOD’s shoreline will be provided? The strategies are as follows: Figure 5. Current public access and visual accessibility to noD’s shoreline from Paas. 336 N. ALHAJAJ AND C. HENDRIGAN 6.1  Shoreline public access in lieu of private parking (SPALPP) This strategy involves applying the easements and permit conditions methods of the Best-Practice on beach resorts—which have issues in providing adequate private parking for their guests—to obtain public access. It does not involve removal of existing private parking within their properties’ perimeter, but only providing public access easement in lieu of the additional parking spaces that have been used outside their property’s private land area. Applying this strategy requires modifying the existing on-street free parking policy along PAAS. As shown in the findings presented in section 5, several beach resorts—which occupy 17% (134 hectares) of NOD’s shoreline—use their front setback and some lanes of the PAAS as informal parking areas for their visitors as they have insufficient parking spaces within the perimeter of their properties, thus causing the loss of public amenity as discussed in detail by Shoup (2011). Additionally, their current developments do not allow visual access to the sea from PAAS and maximize the feel of isolation from the shoreline’s water edge in the district. However, although these beach resorts seem like a negative for NOD’s shoreline, they can serve as an opportunity to provide public access. We propose here that the Municipality of Jeddah links the renewal of the operating licenses of these beach resorts—with limited visitors parking—to providing public access to their water’s edge for non-guests at all (or specific) times. At the time of license renewal, or for any Figure 6. Informal on-street parking on Paas. Table 1. statistics on land filling as well as backreef and inland cutting along noD’s shoreline. Man-made interventions land use in hectare (%) total land area Private residences Beach resort Private undeveloped land Public undeveloped land Marina Fish farm land filling 68.8 (52%) 23.8 (18%) 35.4 (27%) – 2.7 (2%) 0.9 (1%) 132 Backreef cutting 81.8 (72%) 21.9 (19%) 5.7 (5%) – 3.9 (4%) – 113.3 Inland cutting 20.5 (94%) 0.5 (2%) 0.8 (4%) – – – 21.8 CoASTAL MANAGEMENT 337 changes of building or land use, new overriding legislation will enforce the accom- modation of public access in exchange for the right to continue operations. Thus, beach resorts should allocate (or redesign) a portion of their land—such as service lanes or landscaped areas—for providing public walkways and create designated public areas along the water’s edge for recreational activities. Public access should connect people using PAAS to the water’s edge without interfering with the privacy of resort guests or allowing the public to use resorts’ private facilities. It will not lead to any change in land area or removal of existing private guests parking space owned by the beach resorts, and will create a public access provided and maintained by the resort. It is common in beachside areas globally as in the example of Kuta, Bali, Indonesia. The implementation of such a strategy requires Jeddah Municipality to develop plans to manage parking along PAAS by utilizing undeveloped public lands or by redesigning parts of PAAS for this purpose. The advantage of this strategy is that it can easily provide public access to the shoreline without requiring a budget to purchase shoreline land or placing responsibility on the municipality to provide capital or oper- ational budget for such access. It can serve the current low population of the district; however, it will be insufficient to serve NOD’s residents if the population increases as anticipated due to a) the overall limited land of beach resorts (17%) and b) the fact that only a specific land area of resorts will be available for public recreational activ- ities if public access is provided. Another barrier that may affect implementation is that it cannot be applied to beach resorts, which have adequate private parking spaces within their properties. Moreover, it may be difficult to implement the strategy in beach resorts with small land areas as it may affect the availability of remaining open Figure 7. land uses altering noD’s shoreline. 338 N. ALHAJAJ AND C. HENDRIGAN space for private guests. This strategy may also be ineffective if beach resort owners change their visitor policy by providing private buses to transport visitors (for e.g., from home or airport) instead of allowing them entry with their private cars. There will, however, be a cost borne by any change in the visiting policy, which will be calculated in the annual operating budgets of resorts. 6.2.  Instant L-shaped linear parks (ILLP) This strategy is based on planning approaches and land acquisition in the Best-Practices to provide instant public access through undeveloped private fenced lands. It can be implemented for the NOD’s shoreline by modifying the regulations of JLPBC (section 2.2) applied to the future developments of private undeveloped lands. As highlighted in findings, private undeveloped fenced lands—estimated as 176 hectares (23%) of NOD’s shoreline—present as a negative to NOD as they are not developed and their current fences deprive residents from both physical and visual public access to the shoreline. However, providing public access through usage of undeveloped fenced lands may be an important step for NOD for two reasons: 1) instant developments will ensure that the existing empty land areas and their land extensions over the seabed—an estimated area of 35.4 hectare—are not occupied by buildings and facilities that prevent providing proper physical and visual access in the future; 2) this step will not only provide public access, but also prevent these lands from further extending over the seabed to protect the remaining back reef areas. We take the opportunity of having private undeveloped lands and propose the ILLP strategy through modification of the regulations of JLPBC by automatically deducting a 10 m wide strip along one side, and a 15 m wide strip abutting the water edge for all undeveloped private land before development for public access to NOD’s shoreline with no compensation for this deducted strip as it is officially assigned in the regu- lation for public use. By applying the ILLP strategy, public access will be available to connect the public with the water’s edge of NOD’s shoreline. The advantage of this instant public access is that it avoids the need to purchase or wait for these undevel- oped private lands to be developed. It is simpler to deduct these areas before devel- opment, thereby establishing clear boundaries between public and private areas upfront. This will allow Jeddah Municipality the option to combine any two 10 m width accesses between adjacent undeveloped properties to create one wider access of 20 m. However, one barrier that may affect the implementation of such a strategy is the perception of ILLP as a small and narrow POS to serve NOD’s residents’ needs. Another barrier is that the newly provided parks will need a budget for their development and the provision of basic park services. However, the accounting for the social and health benefits potentially provided by this strategy will outweigh this capital costs disadvan- tage. The development of ILLP can be included in the budget of public realm projects of the local government. Alternatively, they can be supported by revenues from the current White Land Tax (WLT), which was established to minimize the impact of urban sprawl and the rapid increase in land prices in Saudi cities caused by large tracts of undeveloped private land (Jeddah Municipality 2009). Here, using WLT annual revenues that are collected mainly from all NOD’s private undeveloped lands can be the first step toward funding the implementation of this strategy. CoASTAL MANAGEMENT 339 6.3.  One time fine or levy for shoreline alteration (OTFLSA) Another strategy is to impose a one-time fine or levy (governmental action strategy) for land filling or altering the shoreline to provide public access. This strategy requires adopting MEWA’s shoreline protection law (section 2.1) to establish a specific fine for urban encroachments in NOD’s shoreline. This is because the processes of land filling over the seabed and backreef cutting by private developments have limited visual accessibility and they damage marine ecology. Land filling—estimated at 132 hectares—shifts the waterline further away. This process makes viewing the water’s edge from PAAS more difficult, even if design options for improving visual access on external walls and buildings are considered. This distance from the shoreline is exacerbated by more buildings and vertical structures on these newly reclaimed lands. Most importantly, land filling over the seabed and backreef cutting (113.3 hectares) have degraded the marine ecology of the shoreline, and altered its longshore sediment movements, which are vital to shoreline health (Basaham et  al. 2006); this has increased the property values as land areas increased but with no public benefit. They have also distorted the continuity of the water’s edge and its natural form and reduced future opportunities for NOD’s residents to have a healthy shoreline pub- lic access. This damage, however, is a key to providing shoreline parks. By using the technical assistance of legal advisors, surveyors, engineers, marine scientists, and GIS data source in the best-practices, the City of Jeddah will be able to establish direct impact and timelines of actions to implement a one-time fine or levy for land filling or backreef cuts. The imposition of such a fine is possible as it can get support from MEWA, which prohibits such a practice at any scale. The fines paid to the Municipality of Jeddah would be allocated toward purchasing land for a new shoreline park in the North Obhur mega-district. This fine will only be imposed if the land in question encroaches into the sea using permanent earthen wharves, permanent land extensions through filling, or backreef cutting. It will also be applied to land filling and backreef cutting that was legally implemented but negatively affected the marine ecology of the shoreline. Calculating the fine or levy will require surveying the shoreline to identify encroachments and an assessment of the marine ecology around all land extensions. Those in breach will be subjected to a fine, payable to the Municipality of Jeddah toward the overall cost of purchasing the required tract of land for a new shoreline park. If the amount collected from these fines is insufficient to purchase new land on the shoreline, additional funds can then be reallocated from the revenue collected by the WLT (see above). The freehold land to be purchased for the proposed park can be selected from tracts of undeveloped private land along NOD’s shoreline, preferably adjacent to large undeveloped public land so that it can be consolidated to create a large shoreline public park. However, there is one barrier that may affect the imple- mentation of this strategy. It relates to the expected high implementation cost of such a complex procedure for identifying the size and damage level that occur along the long NOD’s 55 km water edge. However, the social benefits that will be gained will justify this capital costs disadvantage. For acceptance by all parties, this strategy will require a transparent procedure to identify instances of illegal land filling and the areas of marine ecology that were permanently damaged. Although this strategy might present a financial shock to the current landowners of private residences, beach resorts, 340 N. ALHAJAJ AND C. HENDRIGAN and undeveloped private lands, it can quickly deliver the required revenue to purchase the land for a new shoreline public park in NOD. 6.4.  Annual taxes paid on shoreline alteration (ATPSA) Another way to deal with NOD’s shoreline public access inadequacy is by imposing a new annual tax (governmental action strategy) on landowners of private residences, beach resorts, and undeveloped private lands who have encroached on the seabed from the shoreline through land filling or have damaged the backreef areas. As high- lighted in section 6.3, encroachments maximize blockage of the shoreline and damages to the shoreline ecology. Importantly, they make monitoring and managing the remain- ing marine ecology impossible. Hence, providing public access can be an important step to overcome such an issue (Hui and Gorkovenko 2022). The proposed tax can be established by modifying MEWA’s current fines law. This annual charge, and over several years—or possibly a decade—achieves three things: first, ecological repair (planting of mangroves or seagrass, creation of niches, etc.); second, shoreline purchased on the free market; and last, the capital budget for the installation of public amenities into the shoreline park. While this strategy is similar to the one outlined in section 6.3, the cost to the encroached landowners is less of a shock as it is spread over decades as an ongoing additional charge for the ecological damage, and for being the primary beneficiaries of the current shoreline access and the ongoing privilege of utilizing these sites. However, spreading the cost over decades may be considered a barrier or disadvantage for obtaining quick social benefits for public access to a shoreline that has no such facility. 7.  Discussion This study develops four pragmatic strategies to overcome the issue of unavailability of public access to the NOD’s shoreline, which is important for residents’ health and well-being. The use of a policy-led review of local legal frameworks and global best-practices, including descriptive strategies in this study, confirms previous findings in the literature (Weller 2008; Weller 2009; Deming and Swaffield 2011) regarding effective development of practical strategies to solve problems related to the planning or design of the built environment. The development of the four strategies is based on empirical evidence (site investigation) and a solid evidence-base of practice to ensure that they are functional and can effectively provide public access to NOD’s shoreline. Generally, the developed strategies are practical and can be used and adjusted to suit any city or urban area experiencing this issue. The four strategies developed in this study extend the application methods of the currently used Best-Practice strategies for public shoreline access highlighted in the literature (for e.g., Pogue and Lee 1998; Doody and Booth 2006; Duff, James, and LaBate 2016). The strategy in section 6.1 suggests a simple solution to provide public access without involving the costly purchase of shoreline land by applying easements and permit condition regulations. The strategy in section 6.2 involves implementing minor changes to the current regulations on developments along the shoreline to obtain immediate public access. The strategies in section 6.3 and 6.4 are similar in that they CoASTAL MANAGEMENT 341 seek compensation for altering the morphology and damaging the ecology through land filling that extends into the shoreline, or backreef and inland cutting, which cause significant pollution of the sea as confirmed in the literature (for e.g., Basaham et  al. 2006). These strategies differ in the amount of legal effort and political will required. The strategy in section 6.2 (ILLP) shows how a minor adjustment of existing plan- ning regulations of JLPBC can provide instant public access. This strategy entails obtaining an immediate 10 m width on one side setback and 15 m width from the water edge for all undeveloped private lands, before their development, to link the shore fronting street to the shore for access to the beach. This strategy will provide the residents in Jeddah with public access along with great benefits such as active transport (as a destination to walk/bike to), recreation, and livability. It will ensure the instant acquisition and availability of public access without substantial delays or losing any future right-of-way arising from manipulation that may occur during land development. If these ILLPs are successful, they will be enormously popular and will require basic park amenities (such as toilets and trash bins), and additional parking along the street for the general public. This will be a cost borne by the city to be calculated into its annual operational budget. The strategy in section 6.3 suggests a one-time fine, or levy, on land encroached into the shoreline or developments associated with backreef cutting. The revenue raised is directed toward specific, well-located, and appropriate land for use as public parks along NOD’s shoreline fashioned on the practices of the CRD (2020). This will entail significant surveying to assess the correct quantum of private land filling and damage to the backreef. The Municipality of Jeddah will need to ascertain, in advance, which tracts of land it wishes to purchase on the free market for the park, and their cost, and to then raise the funds following this assessment. It will be difficult to garner sufficient political will to enact a post-occupancy tax on persons currently enjoying title to the land. However, the result should be a final resolution to the non-congruency of population growth and shoreline access in NOD. The strategy in section 6.4 resembles that in section 6.3, in that private lands encroaching into the shoreline or damaging the backreef will be surveyed for the quantum of destruction and assessed for the damages, but that there will be an increase in the annual taxation for those tracts of land that are sea-encroaching. A lower, annual, incremental cost for the encroachment bundled into the taxes will be much more politically acceptable to most private landowners. The revenues raised by the municipal treasury will accrue more slowly, but this will give the Municipality of Jeddah time to plan and design a large public park, or several smaller parks, and to purchase the correct land at the time of their choosing, over a decade or more. This will be slower, but perhaps have better outcomes for all stakeholders, be the private landholders, citizens, or municipal staff. The outcome will be high-quality parks on the shoreline to help deliver the livability and health promotion targets of the Saudi QLP. Strategies in sections 6.1 and 6.2 can minimize the negative impact of the unavail- ability of public access to NOD’s shoreline and provide POS to accommodate current population levels. However, as the population of NOD grows in the future, these spaces will be insufficient for recreation needs. Thus, strategies in section 6.3 or 6.4 must be implemented in advance. Adopting such strategies will solve the issue of shoreline public access in the district, and make the city more sustainable and healthier by 342 N. ALHAJAJ AND C. HENDRIGAN minimizing long driving trips to other shorelines. This would reduce carbon dioxide emissions, traffic accidents, and congestion. They will also provide residents with the opportunities to participate in shoreline recreational activities and improve their phys- ical and mental health. Regardless of the strategies chosen to solve this issue, there will be new concerns to be addressed. Once these strategies are adopted as policies, the shoreline will be made public in North Obhur. Questions of the specific public access and new POS locations, closest neighbors, the gain in access, the new visitor vehicle parking strategy, compensating the land’s current owners, considering the adjacent land use for com- mercial rezoning following the opportunity of the captive clientele, the potential dif- ficulties to ring-fence the capital and operational financing from the levies without loss, and the ecological consequences of increasing visitor numbers in concentrated locations will be among the new issues raised, but these are outside the scope of this study. The conclusions of this study are relevant for other cities with currently limited shoreline access, particularly those that have experienced urbanization along their shorelines before the development of comprehensive coastline management plans. 8.  Conclusion This study extends the current knowledge on best-practice for creating public access to shorelines by proposing four pragmatic strategies applicable to other global cities experiencing the same issue, with several planning precedents, or administrative solu- tions to enhance the quality of life of their residents. These strategies offer several simple ways of providing public access to shorelines in fully occupied urban areas. They can be effective tools for planners, urban designers, and landscape architects to successfully tackle the issue of public access to a significant public amenity such as a waterfront. The study was limited to searching for potential practicable strategies that can assist in gaining public access to NOD’s shorelines. The study did not investigate the required provision of shoreline public access to satisfy the needs of NOD’s residents—a topic ripe for future research. The study also did not investigate the reasons behind the lack of resolution to the public access issue. Moreover, during the process of reviewing best-practice, the study was limited to policies available online and in English. Thus, we highlight the need for further research on the appropriate provision of public access to shorelines in residential mega-districts.
