For women in particular, concerns about making ends meet can cause a lot of anxiety. Despite the ever-increasing percentage of married women who work, women still earn about 82 cents for every dollar that men earn (in 2022 numbers), and the ratio is even lower for women of color. Most women suffer financially in divorce. The prospect of returning to paid work after time spent at home raising kids can also be a source of worry. Spousal support, also called “alimony” or “maintenance,” is designed to help a lower-earning spouse make it through the divorce and the transition into a new single life. (Rules requiring continued health insurance coverage after divorce exist for the same reason.) Depending on the length of the marriage and the degree to which one spouse was financially dependent on the other, support can last for many years. However, the nationwide trend is for courts to award spousal support in fewer and fewer situations, and for shorter durations, because it’s so common for both spouses to work or at least be able to return to work. According to one expert, spousal support is awarded in fewer than 15% of divorces nationwide. Recent years have seen a wave of so-called “alimony reform,” with a number of states revising their support laws in ways that the propo- nents consider more in line with the current realities of how couples earn and work. • In 2023, Florida enacted a law that completely eliminated permanent alimony, even for cases where a spouse had already been receiving payments for many years and was expecting them to continue for their entire lifetime. • As another example, according to a 2012 Massachusetts law, alimony (which is based on mathematical guidelines) ends when the recipient has been living with a new partner for more than three months, and also ends automatically when the recipient reaches retirement age for Social Security purposes, whether or not the person intends to opt into Social Security at that point. 314 | NOLO’S ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DIVORCE The law also places time limits on alimony for marriages that ended before the 20-year mark was reached. • New Jersey adopted rules that provide that alimony can be terminated upon cohabitation, that alimony can’t last longer than the marriage did, and that all support terminates upon the retirement of the payer or the recipient reaching age 67. • In Indiana, spousal support can’t last longer than three years unless the supported spouse suffers from a physical or mental incapacity or is caring for a child who does. • In Texas, no marriage that lasted fewer than 10 years justifies alimony, except under very limited circumstances. One concerning aspect of these new rules is that a few states include provisions for retroactive modification of spousal support. That means that a recipient could be forced to pay back support that was already received. Because support is often negotiated as part of the entire settle- ment package when the divorce is finalized, opponents argue that it is unfair to allow for retroactive modifications—and it seems likely that judges would decline to implement those provisions in cases where the result would be an adjustment in the overall settlement. A number of states have established (or are considering) guidelines for spousal support, similar to those already in place in all states for child support. Both payers and recipients might welcome the greater predictability that guideline formulas could bring to the process of negotiating support. Quite a few states have established guidelines, and the list is ever-changing, so your best bet is to either do an internet search for “alimony guidelines [your state]” or talk to an attorney. Also, be aware that even in states that have guidelines, often these apply only to temporary support pending the completion of the divorce. Spousal support after the divorce is final is still a question for the judge. Given the frequency of changes to alimony laws, if you are managing your divorce on your own, you might want to pay particular attention to current law in your state, and maybe consult an attorney to get the lowdown on the rules that apply to your situation. CHAPTER 11 | SPOUSAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH INSURANCE | 315 Basics of Spousal Support Whether one spouse is entitled to support from the other after the divorce starts with the question of need. Will one spouse require financial help to maintain a standard of living comparable to what the couple had during the marriage? There’s no hard and fast rule, but in general, the longer the marriage, the stronger the presumption that support is appropriate. A marriage of more than 10 years is generally considered a marriage “of long duration” (though again, that is changing in some places as alimony becomes harder to get) and usually carries with it a starting assumption that some support will be awarded. However, even after a long marriage, if you and your spouse both earn about the same amount and have roughly equivalent assets, a judge is unlikely to award support. In any event, spousal support is still an element of some divorce settle- ments and judgments, and it’s definitely something you should raise if you believe you will need it. Don’t be too proud to ask—in most cases, if you aren’t able to support yourself immediately after your divorce, it’s because of sacrifices that you made while you were married. This goes for both men and women. Men who earn significantly less than their wives and need support are just as entitled to ask for it as women are. Even if you don’t need it at the time of the divorce, in most states you can ask for spousal support at a later point unless your final judgment specifically terminates the court’s jurisdiction over support. 20-20 hindsight … “ I didn’t even explore whether I could have gotten alimony,” says one young divorced military spouse. “I thought I wouldn’t need it and I didn’t want to ask him for anything, and we rushed through the whole thing, too. Now it turns out I could really use some help and I wish I’d thought about it more then.” 316 | NOLO’S ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DIVORCE In most cases, judges divide property first, then support is set. That’s because overall resources of each spouse are a factor in determining an appropriate level of spousal support. You and your spouse might decide, for example, that one of you gets more of the property instead of getting support. A judge could make the same decision, awarding one spouse the majority of the property and assets to ensure a comfortable future without a need for spousal support. Of course, if at all possible, it’s best not to leave those decisions up to the judge. Spousal support is as unpredictable as the rest of a contested divorce case, and you’re both a lot better off working out an agreement yourselves than you are turning it over to a judge. Where the High Road Leads What does it mean to take the high road where support is involved? It doesn’t mean being noble and giving up your right to ask for support, nor does it mean turning over your whole paycheck to your lower-earning spouse. It simply requires that both of you take an honest look at your needs and abilities and try to come to a fair agreement that’s structured in the most advantageous way for both of you. (There’s more about how to think about that in “Tax Planning When You Pay or Receive Support,” below.) Types of Spousal Support and How Long They Last Spousal support falls into two broad categories: short-term support and long-term or permanent support. “Reimbursement” support is a kind of long-term support. A spouse may also get temporary support after separation and before the divorce is final. What type of support is ordered, and how long one ex-spouse must help support the other, are as much in the judge’s discretion as CHAPTER 11 | SPOUSAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH INSURANCE | 317 is the amount of support. Some judges start with the assumption that support should last half as long as the marriage did, and then work up or down from there by looking at certain factors. (See “How Courts Set the Amount of Support,” below.) Most states don’t have guidelines for the duration of support, but more and more do—for example, in Texas and Indiana, payments are limited to three years except in special circumstances. In Utah, support can’t last any longer than the marriage did. And in some states, the marriage must have lasted at least 10 years for a court to order support at all. The duration of support also depends on the nature of the support. The discussion of each type of support, below, addresses how long each might be expected to last. It’s possible that a former spouse might receive more than one kind of support at the same time. For example, if a spouse is getting both rehabilitative and short-term support, when the spouse is employed again, the rehabilitative support would end. The short-term support would continue until its termination date. Temporary Support While the Divorce Is Pending You and your spouse don’t need to wait until everything in your divorce is settled to work out spousal support arrangements. In fact, the support issue might be most important immediately after you separate, because the lower-earning spouse needs to be able to pay expenses while the divorce is in process. Some states—or certain counties—have guidelines for temporary spousal support, though many don’t. If you live someplace where guidelines are available, you can use those to set an amount of support. Otherwise you’ll negotiate based on the lower-earning spouse’s need and the higher-earning spouse’s ability to pay. It’s always a good idea to make a written agreement about temporary support. If you can’t agree on a temporary support amount, then you’ll probably spend some time in court arguing over it. If you have a right to support, it starts as soon as you separate. (If you think you are going 318 | NOLO’S ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DIVORCE to end up in court arguing about temporary spousal support, file your papers right away—in most places, support will be retroactive only to the date you filed the paperwork, not to when you separated. You can always withdraw the papers if you find you don’t need a hearing.) Temporary support ends when your divorce is finalized and short- term or long-term support begins. In some cases, temporary support is the only spousal support received if the spouses agree on no ongoing support, or if the court finds the marriage was too short or there is no need for support beyond the temporary period. Chapters 2 and 5 discuss in more detail agreements and court proceedings for temporary support orders. Short-Term and Rehabilitative Support Short-term support is appropriate when the marriage itself was quite short. (This type of support lends itself to the possibility of a lump-sum payment instead of monthly checks. See “Paying Spousal Support in a Lump Sum,” below.) Short-term support lasts only a few years, and its precise ending date is set in the court order or settlement agreement. Rehabilitative support, sometimes also called “bridge the gap” support, is a specific kind of short-term support, designed to help a dependent spouse get retrained and back into the workforce. It generally lasts until the recipient is back to work. Generally, that date isn’t set in advance— the agreement is that the support payments will stop when the recipient completes a retraining program and becomes employed in the chosen industry. The recipient is responsible for diligently pursuing the training or course of study and then searching for work. The other spouse is responsible for paying the support until that point—and a payer who suspects the recipient isn’t really trying to complete an education or get work can ask the court to reduce the support amount or set a termina- tion date. The person asking for the modification would have to prove that the other ex-spouse was not working hard enough. CHAPTER 11 | SPOUSAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH INSURANCE | 319 Long-Term or Permanent Support Permanent support may be granted after long marriages (generally, more than 10 years), if the judge concludes that the dependent spouse most likely won’t go back into the workforce and will need support indefinitely. A few states don’t allow permanent support, but most do have provisions for long-term support that could even last beyond the paying spouse’s retirement in some circumstances. Even so-called “permanent” support does eventually end in most cases—only a handful of states permit true permanent alimony, and even in those states permanent support is generally limited to situations where the supported spouse is disabled or seriously ill. Of course, it ends when either the recipient or the payer dies. It also may end when the payer retires or the recipient remarries. And in about half the states, it ends if the recipient begins living with another person in a marriage- like relationship, where the couple provides mutual support and shares financial responsibilities. (Just having a roommate doesn’t count.) Reimbursement Support Reimbursement support is the only type of spousal support that’s not completely based on financial need. Instead, it’s a way to compensate a spouse who sacrificed education, training, or career advancement during the marriage by taking any old job that would support the family while the other spouse trained for a lucrative professional career. Generally, both spouses expected that once the professional spouse was established and earning the anticipated higher salary, the sacrificing spouse would benefit from the higher standard of living and be free to pursue a desirable career. If the marriage ends before that spouse gets any of those expected benefits, reimbursement support rebalances the scales by making the professional spouse return some of what was given during the marriage. Because it’s not tied to need, reimbursement support ends whenever the agreement or court order says it does. Its termination generally isn’t tied to an event like the supported spouse getting work or remarrying. Reimbursement support is becoming less and less common. 320 | NOLO’S ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DIVORCE How Courts Set the Amount of Support Leaving a support decision in the hands of a judge is risky business. This isn’t like child support, where the formulas are clear and pretty rigid. In most states, the amount and duration of spousal support payments are entirely up to the judge. Obviously, it’s preferable for you and your spouse to keep control of decisions about spousal support. If the two of you can agree to an amount of support and how long it will be paid, then that’s what the judge will order. It’s the only way to predict what’s going to happen. Only about a dozen states give judges general guidelines for calculating support. In these states, to calculate a starting figure, the judge uses a formula that takes into account the length of the marriage and the spouses’ incomes. Then the judge factors in other circumstances to arrive at a final amount and decide how long the payments will last. Here’s a look at some of those circumstances. Need and Ability to Pay Once the court decides that one spouse is entitled to support, it will try to quantify that need and the other spouse’s ability to pay. The judge may take into account: • how property is being divided in the divorce • the standard of living during the marriage, and the dependent spouse’s ability to maintain that standard in the absence of support • each spouse’s separate income, assets, and obligations (states define “income” differently, with some including unearned income and others limiting the definition more strictly) • the length of the marriage (more significant in deciding how long support will last than in determining the amount) • whether the spouses lived together before they were married and whether any part of the cohabitation should be included in the length of the marriage (most states don’t consider this factor at all) • each spouse’s age and health CHAPTER 11 | SPOUSAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH INSURANCE | 321 • the needs of children, and whether child care responsibilities affect the dependent spouse’s ability to return to work • whether the dependent spouse left the workforce to be a homemaker or raise children • how long the dependent spouse has been out of the workforce, that spouse’s marketable skills, and what retraining might be necessary • contributions that either spouse made to the other’s training, education, or career advancement • the possibility that either spouse might acquire assets in the future (such as the maturing of stock options or a large inheritance), and • any other factors that the judge thinks should be considered. Earning Capacity In addition to looking at actual income, a judge may examine each spouse’s ability to earn money. The idea here is that if you could earn significantly more than you are, and you voluntarily choose a lower standard of living, your spouse shouldn’t have to suffer financially because of it. Shirking doesn’t pay … “My ex-wife was a nurse. She left me for a guy she met while taking a photo graphy class, then quit her job to try being a photographer. Her income went down to about a quarter of what it had been, and she wanted me to pay her support—even though I had the kids most of the time, too. I said I’d pay support according to what her nursing job paid— which meant I would be paying just about nothing. She fought me at first, but then I think her lawyer told her she was going to lose. She went back to nursing.” —Divorced parent of two 322 | NOLO’S ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DIVORCE If either you or your spouse has skills or education that you are not using—for example, if you are trained as a lawyer but are working in a service job, for example—the court can “impute” to you a higher income than what you actually have. You may be ordered to pay support consistent with your earning power, not your actual income. And if you’re the recipient spouse, you might get support that’s consistent with your ability to earn, rather than what you actually earn—or you may be ordered to fend for yourself. Fault In some states, you can argue that fault should be considered in setting spousal support (you can make this argument whether or not you filed for divorce on the basis of fault). If the higher-earning spouse committed adultery, was abusive, or is for some other reason at fault for the divorce, the support payment may be increased. Of course, as the saying goes, you can’t get blood from a turnip. If there’s only a certain amount of support that your errant spouse can afford, the court won’t order an unrealistically high payment. More commonly, the spouse who receives support has payments reduced because of fault. Beyond Spousal Support Spousal support is usually a temporary measure, designed to keep one spouse from running into financial trouble immediately after a divorce. Even if you’re receiving support, you are ultimately responsible for your financial future. Make a one-year, three-year, and five-year plan for where you want to be in your life, and include what kind of work you want to be doing and what you want in terms of salary and benefits. If you received significant property or other assets in the divorce settlement, invest them wisely and with an eye toward the future. Learn to budget, if you haven’t yet. CHAPTER 11 | SPOUSAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH INSURANCE | 323 Negotiating Support With Your Spouse Before you start negotiating with your spouse about support, look carefully at the factors judges consider (discussed above). They might help you in your negotiations—and if you can’t agree, at least you’ll know what the judge may take into account. SEE AN EXPERT Your mediator or lawyer can help you. If you’re using mediation or collaborative law to resolve your divorce case, you can work with the professionals to figure out how much support is appropriate. If you’re in a contested divorce, your lawyer will help you come up with an amount based on all of the factors described above. Evaluating Your Spouse’s Resources Whether you’re the one who’ll be receiving or paying support, you need information to negotiate effectively. Otherwise, you can’t feel comfortable that the support you agree to is adequate for your needs— or consistent with your ability to pay. Almost all states require both spouses to disclose financial information as part of the divorce proceeding. This is true even if it’s clear which spouse will pay support—the recipient spouse’s resources are important to determining need, and the paying spouse’s to determining ability to pay. If you have been responsible during the marriage for all of the financial ins and outs, you’re certain that there’s nothing you don’t know about your spouse’s financial situation, or you trust your spouse’s word 100%, you won’t need to ask for more. Otherwise, make sure the following things are included in the forms that you’re both required to fill out. And if they’re not, use the discovery methods described in Chapter 5 to get the additional information you need. You’ll need to know about: • Your spouse’s separate assets. If your spouse has separate assets, you’re entitled to know their value and whether they generate income that might be considered in setting support. (The judge may consider them if called upon to decide a support amount.) 324 | NOLO’S ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DIVORCE • Income and expense information. You definitely want a detailed monthly income and expense report—which should be one of the forms your spouse is required to give you—to show you where your spouse’s money is going. If the expense report shows $500 being spent every month on dining out, and all you can afford are microwave dinners while streaming movies, you’ll surely want to point this out. At the other end of the spectrum, if your spouse is seeking a large amount of support while you know that separate liquid assets are available for daily expenses, get the information that will prove it. • Bonuses, overtime, stock, and benefits. Don’t forget income from things like bonuses and overtime, even though they’re not com- pletely predictable. If your spouse has regularly received a bonus or lots of overtime pay, you can average the amount received in the last few years and use that figure. Likewise, pay attention to things like stock options and RSUs (which may be counted as income or assets) and the value of work-related benefits, such as unused vacation pay and sick pay, company-paid vehicles, and health insurance benefits. All of these items have a measurable value that should be factored into a spousal support negotiation. You might need to ask for your spouse’s employee manual or other work-related benefits information to find out what the company’s policies are on accruing sick and vacation time, so that you know what’s there. Evaluating Your Needs Given that you’ll be required to prepare a monthly income and expense disclosure anyway, use it to determine how much support you need. Look at the difference between your expenses and your income, and then factor in whatever resources you have and look at the list of factors above. Because there’s usually no standard formula, all you can do is decide what you think you need and ask for it. That will get the negotiations started. CHAPTER 11 | SPOUSAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH INSURANCE | 325 TIP Remember, nothing’s getting cheaper. If you’re the person getting support, once you’ve settled on an amount, you might want to include a provi- sion for increasing the amount each year—a cost of living adjustment (often shortened to COLA). You can tie the increases to the national or a local COLA index (available online), or assume an annual increase of a specific percentage. Paying Spousal Support in a Lump Sum Spousal support doesn’t have to be paid a month at a time. In fact, you and your spouse might prefer one lump sum payment, for emotional reasons as much as anything else. The recipient doesn’t have to worry that the support payments won’t arrive on time (or won’t arrive at all) if the paying spouse suffers a reversal of fortune or simply stops paying. In addition, if the recipient wants to buy a new house or start a business after the divorce, the lump sum payment can be a good way to get started. The paying spouse gets to take care of the obligation in one fell swoop and never bother with monthly payments. Both spouses get to avoid the ongoing entanglement. Why doesn’t everyone do this, then? Lots of people can’t afford the big payout, for one thing. The recipient spouse won’t be able to count on the regular income from ongoing support, but instead must invest and manage the lump sum. If you’re thinking about taking a lump sum payment for spousal support, consider your own financial habits. What are you likely to do if you suddenly have a large sum of money available to you? If you’re something of a spendthrift, work out a plan beforehand for investing the money so that it doesn’t get frittered away. Lump sum spousal support is neither deductible nor taxable. Prior to 2019, monthly spousal support was tax-deductible to the payer; the 2017 tax changes revoked that deduction. Should that change again, the monthly vs. lump sum calculus would also change. A way to create the same outcome as if spousal support were taxable and deductible is to pay the lump sum out of retirement savings—the payer escapes paying tax 326 | NOLO’S ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DIVORCE on those funds at withdrawal, while the receiving spouse will pay when they withdraw funds at retirement, so the outcome is the same as if the amounts were deductible and taxable at the time of payment (except that the receiving spouse’s tax bracket might be lower at retirement). SEE AN EXPERT Consult an attorney or accountant. Before deciding to go ahead with a lump sum payment, talk to a professional about the tax consequences. Payments to Third Parties In certain circumstances, the paying spouse can make payments to third parties instead of to the other as a substitute for spousal support. Payments to a third party can include payments for medical costs, housing expenses, tuition, or anything else that is provided for under your divorce order or settlement agreement. For example, if you’re required by the divorce decree to pay the mortgage, insurance, and property taxes on the family home even though your spouse now owns it, those payments can be considered spousal support. Why would you use third-party payments? If your spouse is getting extended (COBRA) coverage under your group health insurance plan at work, the employee spouse might want to pay the premiums through payroll deductions. Either spouse might want to have spousal support paid directly to a third party if the spouse receiving support isn’t the greatest financial manager. For example, if you know your spouse isn’t good about paying the mortgage on time, you might want to make sure your kids’ living situation is secure by paying the mortgage yourself. If you’re the spouse getting support and are worried about your ability to save up enough of your support to pay your school tuition each quarter, you might ask your spouse to do it for you and deduct the amount from monthly support payments. CHAPTER 11 | SPOUSAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH INSURANCE | 327 Planning for Possible Disability or Death of the Supporting Spouse If the supporting spouse dies unexpectedly, the recipient will suffer a sudden, and possibly catastrophic, loss of income. To protect against that possibility, it’s prudent to purchase a life insurance policy with the recipient spouse as the beneficiary. It’s also not unreasonable to buy disability insurance to protect against total disability, which would render the supporting spouse unable to pay as agreed. Some courts will even order the purchase of insurance as a term of settlement. In either case, if you’re the recipient spouse, it’ll probably be up to you to ask for the insurance and to try to get your spouse to pay for the policy. If you’re negotiating with your spouse, make this part of the negotiation. If you’re in court, you can ask the judge to order that insurance be provided and decide who pays for it. If possible, have the policy placed in your name, so that you’re sure it can’t be terminated without your knowledge. Most life and disability insurance premiums aren’t enormously costly—term life insurance is really inexpensive. And definitely ensure that your settlement agreement or court order provides that you can have direct access to the insurance company for the purpose of confirming that the policy is in force and the beneficiary designation is as agreed. (If you can’t do that, try to arrange to be the person notified if there is a lapse in premium payments.) How do you know how much insurance to purchase? The same actuary who helped you determine the value of the retirement plans (see discussion of using experts in Chapter 10) can perform some calculations that will give you the present value of the support you’re expecting in the future. For example, the actuary might tell you that you’ll need a $300,000 life insurance policy to replace support you would lose if your spouse died in the next few years. 328 | NOLO’S ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DIVORCE Changing the Amount of Spousal Support Later Spousal support is different from child support in many ways, and perhaps the most important is that while a court can change the terms of a child support order until the child is a legal adult, in most states, you can end or limit the court’s power over spousal support. In other words, you can build in—or preclude—future modification of the support obligation. All you and your spouse need to do is put a provision in your settlement agreement that states how spousal support can be modified—or that it cannot be changed. If a judge decides on spousal support for you, the judge will also decide whether and under what circumstances support can be modified later. If you’re negotiating an agreement about spousal support, you can state that the amount can’t change at all, no matter what happens. (One Missouri man might have regretted making such an agreement when the court ordered him to continue paying support to his ex-wife even though she allegedly tried to have him killed.) The paying spouse might agree to this if the likelihood of a downward reduction seems slim (as where employment is secure or assets are high). The recipient spouse might think it would be easier to persuade the other to pay a higher amount at the time of settlement if there’s a no-change provision, and it also means that support should keep coming even if the paying spouse’s employment situation changes. If you want some future flexibility, you might state that the amount can change only if one of the following occurs: • Both ex-spouses agree. • The court orders it. • Either spouse’s income changes by a specified percentage. • One spouse becomes disabled. If you don’t have a modification provision in your settlement agree- ment, and you can’t agree later to a change, then your state’s law will control the matter. Most courts allow modification if there is a significant CHAPTER 11 | SPOUSAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH INSURANCE | 329 change of circumstances. Some states, however, won’t modify spousal support at all—they allow courts to make orders only about child support after the divorce is final. (And in Texas, the support amount can only be modified downward!) Often, a court will order a temporary modification, just for the period of changed circumstances. For example, if you are paying support and you lose your job, the court might reduce your support obligation for six months or until you find a new job, whichever happens sooner. If at the end of six months you still haven’t found work, you’d have to return to court and ask for additional time. Tax Planning When You Pay or Receive Support When you’re negotiating with your spouse or arguing in court about the level, type, and duration of spousal support, don’t ignore tax issues. This section explains the basic rules and major concerns for each spouse, with the caveat that the tax law that went into effect in 2019 has made some significant changes in how taxes and spousal support interact. Basic Rules Since 2019, spousal support is no longer deductible for the payor or taxable to the recipient. However, for many years, spousal support was reported as taxable income by the recipient and deducted by the paying spouse, unless spouses agreed otherwise. (This is the opposite of child support, which is neither taxable nor deductible.) This rule continues to apply to previous agreements and to agreements signed on or before December 31, 2018. If You Receive Support If you received spousal support under an agreement signed before the end of 2018, you need to plan for the potential tax impact of the income. Unlike an employer, your former spouse won’t withhold any taxes from your support check. If you’re staying at home to care for 330 | NOLO’S ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DIVORCE young children and have no other source of income, paying estimated tax each quarter (to both the IRS and your state) might be a good way to avoid taking a tax hit at the end of the year. If you have a paying job, then increasing withholding from your paycheck is another way to offset the potential impact of support payments. RESOURCE Let the tax man help you, for once. The IRS offers a number of publications that might help you as you negotiate support. IRS Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax, is one, and IRS Publication 504, Divorced or Separated Individuals, is another. Both are available at www.irs.gov or by phone request at 800-829-3676. Make sure anything you review has been updated following the change of law in 2017. Payments made to third parties on your behalf (see above) are treated just as though they were paid to you. Keeping Health Insurance in Force Making sure that health insurance continues after divorce is a major issue for most divorcing people. The vast majority of insured Americans get their health insurance through employment, and many people are insured through their spouse’s employment benefits. Because of this, a federal law, called COBRA, requires insurers and employers to provide ongoing medical insurance to divorcing spouses for a period of time. ! CAUTION Unmarried same-sex couples may not get COBRA benefits. COBRA is a federal law, and the federal government doesn’t recognize same-sex domestic partnerships and civil unions, even if they are marriage-equivalent relationships for state purposes. Some employers and insurers choose to allow former same-sex partners to retain coverage under COBRA, but if they don’t, there’s not much you can do about it. Married same-sex couples, however, are eligible for COBRA coverage. CHAPTER 11 | SPOUSAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH INSURANCE | 331 Staying Insured Through Your Former Spouse With COBRA No, it’s not a scary snake. In fact, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA for short) is the opposite of frightening— it is a critical safety net for employees who lose their jobs and for spouses who are divorcing the person whose employment is their source of medical insurance. All private employers with 20 or more employees are covered by COBRA. Most states have a similar law for employers with fewer than 20 employees. Employees of public entities are not covered by COBRA, but some states have laws that parallel COBRA and might cover public employees. If you’re not eligible for COBRA, check with the human resources department of your spouse’s employer to find out whether another type of continuation coverage is available. COBRA provides that when an employee insured by a group policy gets divorced, the employee’s former spouse can remain covered for up to three years on the group insurance policy. The nonemployee spouse must pay for the benefits, but can be charged no more than what the employer is paying for them plus a 2% administrative fee (which can be quite steep). After three years, the nonemployee spouse is entitled to convert the group insurance to a private policy with equivalent benefits without the insurance company requiring medical tests or records, but most people don’t because it’s just too expensive. Generally, only someone who is otherwise uninsurable would take advantage of that provision. If you’re the spouse receiving coverage under COBRA, you need to know when the 36-month period begins. Most insurance plans start the period when the final divorce order is issued by the court. Because many months go by between when you and your spouse separate and when your divorce is final, you might get a significant amount of coverage before the clock even begins ticking on the COBRA limit (and before the higher premium kicks in). Check the terms of the plan to be sure. You are entitled to a copy of the plan upon request. The human resources folks at your spouse’s employer can also advise you, but they might not be as familiar with the details of the plan as you might expect. (To get the maximum possible time, if the plan says that the final judgment is the event that starts the 36-month period running, 332 | NOLO’S ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DIVORCE it’s a good idea to wait until after the judgment is entered to advise the employer about the divorce. Otherwise the employer might use the date that the notice was received as the starting point—and courts have said that’s okay.) COBRA has strict time limits. The employee spouse must notify the plan administrator of the divorce—generally, through the employer— within 60 days after the court issues the final judgment. If your spouse is the employee, make sure this gets taken care of. To be completely certain it happens, you might want to do it yourself. The plan administrator then has 14 days to send you notice of your right to elect COBRA coverage. You then have 60 days to send back the forms electing coverage, and 45 additional days to pay the premiums back to the date of eligibility. It’s a good idea to return the paperwork right away, both to be sure that nothing goes wrong and to avoid having to pay lots of premiums at once. After you’ve elected coverage, for the most part you won’t need to go through your spouse for any of your COBRA transactions. You’ll pay your premiums directly to the insurer and use your coverage just like any other member of the group. The COBRA Timeline 60 days 14 days 60 days 45 days Divorce judgment entered 1.

If you have general questions about COBRA and divorce, call the plan administrator or the Employee Benefits Security Administration (part of the Department of Labor) toll-free hotline number, 866-444-EBSA (3272). You can also go to the Department of Labor website at www.dol.gov/ebsa and read consumer FAQs on COBRA. COBRA is a great benefit and one that you certainly want to take advantage of, but it’s also time for you to think about what coverage will be available to you once your COBRA coverage ends. If you’re pretty certain that you’ll eventually get a job with health care benefits—or if you already have a job that provides coverage, but you’re opting for COBRA because your spouse’s coverage is better—then it’s obviously not as important. But if you are retraining, or for some other reason you don’t expect to be employed when the 36 months end, you definitely need to explore your options. You should also explore whether less expensive coverage is available under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. You can search for coverage on www.healthcare.gov, the federal government’s ACA website, or you can go to www.legalconsumer.com/obamacare and search for information about your state’s insurance marketplace.
