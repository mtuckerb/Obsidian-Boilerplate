Tucker Bradford POS-101 Ronald Schmidt 30 May 2025 In Federalist #10, Madison established the intention of the founders, that factions be diminished and disempowered in a manner that would not threaten the individual liberties of the citizenry. In the same document, Madison spoke at length about the reasoning behind the sizing of our representative democracy; \"However small the Republic may be, the Representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude\" (Madison np). It seems clear that Madison was envisioning a representative federal democracy in which factions (groups who put the good of the few above the good of the many) were curtailed by design. From Madison's deliberately stated intention, we can fashion a simple test by which to test the efﬁcacy of our evolved government, against the founder's ideal. If our government enables factions to exist, thrive and control the outcomes of government, it is a betrayal of the founder's vision. If cabals are \"… able to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression,\" then they are explicitly an abomination of the promise of our federal republic. If— through their machinations— special interest groups are able to \"overburden the inferior number\" and commend those shilling to \"their own pockets,\" then our system has failed its design principals. (Madison) One might be rankled by the suggestion that lobbyists must be further diminished in their power to sway government and policy. In fact, in the US Supreme Court case Buckley v Valeo, the court determined that campaign funding (the fuel for the lobbying machine) was protected by our First Amendment right to free speech. The court believed that our system was so married to a two party system 1that success in either of those parties was \"so expensive\" that campaign spending was in fact, \"a form of political speech\" (Schmidt. 2018). At its best, this decision seems only to favor richer factions over poorer ones. It does nothing to promote the intention that factions be effectively disempowered from inﬂuencing our government to subvert the will of the aggregate population. Madison argued that removal of the causes of factions would amount to tyranny, (ostensibly because it would limit the gathering of groups and their free speech), but a prohibition or ceiling placed on campaign ﬁnancing would have no such impact on the aggregate individual, unless of course you were to deﬁne a corporation as an individual… It seems that this is the framing that the court chose for this critically important decision. In protecting campaign ﬁnancing, they were in fact protecting the freedom of speech of the individual… dollar. 1 The very notion of a two party system was seemingly inconceivable to the founders. Embedded in his writing, is Madison's assumption that a multi-party government would be the natural result of a federal republic. \"Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal degree does the encreased variety of parties, comprised within the Union, encrease this security.\" Not only were Madison and his supporters explicitly anti-faction, they were also expressly in favor of a multi-party republic. When the Supreme Court ruled on Buckley v Valeo, it seems to me that they were expressly ignoring the warnings of the framers of the Constitution, effectively diminishing the aggregate good, in favor of the few. I will grant that the court may have believed— as did the pundits of the time— that their ruling would eliminate all political parties in the US (Schmidt. 2018). It has been demonstrated since that this was not the outcome, and by all the merits of our great federal republic experiment, we must now correct the course.
