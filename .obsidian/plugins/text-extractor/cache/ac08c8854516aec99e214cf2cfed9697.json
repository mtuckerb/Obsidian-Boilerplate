It is beneficial for you to have a basic understanding of behavioral health, how diagnoses are determined, and various mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders in children, as well as effective treatment strategies. As a BHP, you are not expected to be an expert or have clinical training. Your role is to further the goals of the child and family, as outlined in the treatment plan, IEP, and/or IFSP. The intent of this module is to provide you with an introduction to children’s behavioral health. Upon completion of Module 8, you will:  Define Mental Health.  Be familiar with common disorders in children served.  Explore risk factors.  Review Evidence Based Practices.  Understand the role of medication in the child’s treatment.  Be familiar with medication classifications, uses, and potential side- effects. BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 6 The Individual Child It is essential that you approach your work with each child by remembering that she is an individual. Each child has a unique style of functioning and inherent strengths, and each child’s symptoms associated with her diagnosis manifest uniquely. For example, similarities may exist among children with diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but no two children with ASD will behave exactly the same. One child with ASD may also have an intellectual disability, while another may have above normal intelligence. Approach each child with an open mind by setting aside your assumptions about their diagnosis. Each child also experiences their family in a unique way. Therefore, it will be of equal importance to understand the child’s perspective of her family and how the family experiences their child and their child’s needs. Listening to the family and observing their interactions will assist you to better understand the child and family’s culture, which will enable you to implement strategies that are culturally sensitive and are intended to help enhance the child’s functioning. One of the most valuable things that you do as a BHP is to maintain a “strength-based perspective,” which means that you strive to recognize and support the child and family’s inherent skills, talents, and strengths. Children flourish when the people in their lives are able to understand their challenging behavior and appreciate their unique abilities and strengths. Seize opportunities to catch children “being good” and acknowledge their desirable behaviors. When you are able to point out to the child the things that are special about her and the things that she does well, you instill hope, build self-esteem, and foster respect. Some of the ways to identify strengths include: • Noticing the things that are working well for the child and family • Noticing what is happening when problem behavior is not occurring • Recognizing the skills that the child has already mastered • Recognizing the things that the child enjoys doing and is interested in • Acknowledging the things that you like about the child and make your time with them enjoyable • Considering how a perceived deficit or limitation might also be a strength BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 7 • Avoiding global characterizations of behavior – “He always teases his brother,” “She never picks up her messes,” or “They are resistant to change.” Think about a child that you are working with. Write down three things that the child does well: 1. _________________________________________________________________________ 2. _________________________________________________________________________ 3. _________________________________________________________________________ Write down three things that you like or enjoy about this child (his or her endearing qualities): 1. _________________________________________________________________________ 2. _________________________________________________________________________ 3. _________________________________________________________________________ Reframe: Strength-Based Beliefs and Terminology Pejorative Label – Deficits vs. Positive Reframe – Empowerment Obnoxious Good at pushing people away Resistant Cautious Lazy / Not Invested Manipulative Stubborn / Defiant Tantrum / Meltdown / Outburst Learning Disabled Different / Odd Note: From “No Such Thing as a Bad Kid!” by C. Appelstein, MSW, (n.d.), p. 9. Adapted and reprinted with permission. Mental Health Many definitions of mental health can be summarized as: how a person thinks, feels, and acts. It is how a person views herself, her life, and others. BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 8 Mental health is recognized as how a person evaluates stressors, explores choices, and responds to the environment. “Mental Health,” “Mental Hygiene,” and “Mental Wellness” are terms used to describe the absence of mental illness. A person who experiences the psychological state of well-being – meaning she is able to function and adapt in the context of her environment – has mental wellness. It is important to note that optimal functioning for one person may not be the same as optimal functioning for another person. Individuals experience a range of emotional, behavioral, interpersonal, and cognitive functioning. We should be careful not to impose an ideal or general view of mental wellness on the individuals whom we serve. This quality is at the heart of a strength-based approach. Positive Psychology is the emerging scientific study of the strengths and virtues that enable individuals and communities to thrive. Traditional psychology uses the medical model to diagnose and treat mental illness. It begins by identifying the pathology or dysfunction. Dr. Martin Seligman (n.d.), Director of the University of Pennsylvania Positive Psychology Center, asserts that “treatment is not just fixing what is broken; it is nurturing what is best.” Seligman and his colleagues have identified twenty-four character strengths and virtues that define what is best about human beings. Every person possesses each of these character strengths, but they do so in varying degrees.

Risk Factors Our understanding of mental illness and other disorders comes from research in behavioral science and neuroscience. The Bio-Psycho-Social Model identifies the following elements as potential risk factors that could interfere with a child’s healthy growth and development, and possibly lead to a mental, physical, and/or developmental disorder. These factors are interrelated, and individuals may experience multiple risk factors. It is important to note that the presence of one or more risk factors does not mean that an individual will definitively experience difficulty or delays, merely that she may be more vulnerable. BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 12 Biological: • Genetics; genetic disorders or an inherited predisposition to physical or mental illness • Prenatal damage from poor prenatal care/poor nutrition and/or exposure to toxins such as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or elevated levels of maternal stress Social: • Environmental issues such as poverty or deprivation • Unsatisfactory relationships, including abuse and neglect • Mental health diagnosis in parent/caregiver(s) • Exposure to traumatic events such as domestic violence, crime, war, etc. Psychological: • Thoughts and beliefs, emotions and behaviors • Responses to stress • Temperament Genetics Neurochemistry Pre-natal toxins Effects of medications Temperament IQ Self-esteem Environment Trauma Lack of resources Relationships Biological Social Psychological Bio-Psycho-Social Model BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 13 Diagnosis A diagnosis of a mental illness is made following careful clinical consideration by a licensed clinician. This consideration includes, but is not limited to, problematic client symptoms and difficulty functioning. Functioning could be impacted in one or more of the life domains – home, community, school, work, etc. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a little more than 20% (or 1 in 5) of U.S. children and youth are affected by a serious mental illness (SMI) during their lifetime (2015). Diagnoses are determined by licensed professionals only. Professionals such as psychiatrists and physicians (MD or DO), psychologists (Ph.D.), Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW), Nurse Practitioners (NP), Physician Assistants (PA), or Licensed Clinical Professional Counselors (LCPC) are qualified to diagnose. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is the guide used by clinicians to diagnose. The first edition was published in 1952. The DSM is currently in its fifth edition (DSM-5), which was published in 2013. The Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC:0-3) was originally published in 1994 by ZERO TO THREE (www.zerotothree.org). This system was developed to assist clinicians in diagnosing mental health and developmental disorders in children under three years old. A revised edition (DC:0-5) was published in 2016 and includes disorders in children up to five years old. The DSM-IV and DC:0-3 used a multiaxial classification system: Multiaxial Classification: DSM IV DC:0-3R Axis I Clinical Disorders Clinical Disorders Axis II Intellectual Disabilities or Personality Disorders Relationship Classification Axis III General Medical Conditions Medical and Developmental Disorders and Conditions Axis IV Psychosocial and Environmental Problems Psychosocial Stressors Axis V Global Assessment of Functioning or Children’s Global Assessment Scale Emotional and Social Functioning With this most recent revision of the DSM-IV to the DSM-5, numerous changes have been made to reflect recent research and evidenced-based BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 14 knowledge in the fields of psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. The APA explains that the DSM-5 has discontinued the multiaxial classification system and “has moved to nonaxial documentation of diagnosis, with separate notations for important psychosocial and contextual factors,” such as age, development, and culture (2013, p. 15). The changes in diagnostic criteria are meant to more adequately address a person’s functioning. In the DSM-5 Made Easy, author James Morrison (2014) states, “A mental disorder is a clinically important syndrome; that is, it’s a collection of symptoms (these can be behavioral or psychological) that causes the person disability or distress in social, personal, or occupational functioning” (p. 12). Note: the DC:0-5 continues to use the multiaxial system. The restructuring of diagnostic groups in the DSM-5 is also intended to better address the interrelationship of disorders, recognizing that symptoms occur on a continuum from mild to moderate to severe. In fact, when giving a diagnosis, the clinician may specify the degree of severity that the individual is experiencing. New chapters have been developed and additional disorders have been included with the goal of more accurately diagnosing and treating people. Other changes in terminology have been made, such as the diagnosis of Mental Retardation, which has been replaced with Intellectual Disability due to the derogatory connotation that the word “retarded” has developed in our society. Diagnosis of mental health disorders is not an exact science, and some disorders are difficult to diagnose. Similar to physical illness, presenting symptoms could be attributed to several conditions. The DSM-5 identifies about 157 main diagnoses and almost 500 condition codes. (Numerical codes are used for billing purposes.) Differential Diagnosis is the systematic method of diagnosing a disorder with multiple overlapping symptoms from “different” diagnoses. Through observation and evaluation, the clinician rules out diagnoses until one remains. However, it is possible for children to have more than a single diagnosis. Comorbid and comorbidity are terms often used when an individual has more than one diagnosis. A child with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may also have a comorbid condition of an anxiety disorder or a depressive disorder. Some disorders have a strong connection with certain other disorders. As Morrison (2014) cautions, “Diagnosis isn’t for amateurs” (p. 14). It is not just matching an individual’s symptoms to a list of criteria; it requires professional training and expertise. Moreover, despite a growing body of research, there is BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 15 still much that is unknown about mental health and how the human brain works. Diagnosis is simply a tool that the clinician uses to guide treatment. The child’s diagnosis is a clinical label to describe her cluster of symptoms and functioning; it is not who she is as a person.

Also provided is an overview of the State of Maine Evidence Based Practices for treating children. As a BHP, it will be helpful for you to recognize some of the symptoms associated with a particular disorder and the recommended treatment strategies. Neurodevelopmental Disorders: • Intellectual Disability (ID) • Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 16 • Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Intellectual Disability Intellectual Disability is diagnosed when a person has both a significantly low IQ (approximately 70 or below the norm) and considerable challenges in everyday functioning. Symptoms are present before age 18. The severity of the disorder is determined by the individual’s adaptive functioning, not her IQ. Adaptive functioning is assessed by evaluating skills such as communication, social skills, and developmentally appropriate activities for daily living such as dressing, money management, meal preparation, and more. While there is no cure, most children with intellectual disabilities are capable of learning, acquiring adaptive skills, and achieving a degree of independence. It is important to identify and support their individual strengths. Developmental Disability is a broad term that includes a number of disabilities including intellectual disability, and it is used to describe severe, chronic disabilities that are cognitive and/or physical that appear before the age of 22. Children with developmental disabilities may have impairments in speech, vision, hearing, learning, or motor skills. Cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, and Spina Bifida are examples of other developmental disabilities. Autism Spectrum Disorder The DSM-5 has eliminated the five separate subcategories under the umbrella of Pervasive Developmental Disorder in the DSM-IV and named one disorder - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The single diagnostic category of ASD is characterized by two core areas of impairment: 1) deficits in social communication and social interactions, and Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autistic Disorder Asperger’s Rett syndrome Childhood disintegrative disorder PDD-NOS BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 17 2) restricted repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities (RRBs). Much is still unknown about ASD and its causes. What is known is that it is a complex neurological disorder that affects brain development and arises in early childhood continuing into adulthood. Research suggests that it has both genetic and environmental origins (Chaste & Leboyer, 2012). Since 2000, the rates of children diagnosed with autism have steadily increased. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2020, 1 in every 54 children was estimated to have ASD, which is 2.5 times higher than the data from 2004. Many children receiving behavioral health services in Maine have a diagnosis of ASD. Therefore, we have devoted a separate module (Module 9) to address autism in which we will discuss in more depth the history, symptoms, and evidence-based treatment strategies related to ASD. Early diagnosis and intervention are associated with dramatically better outcomes for children with ASD. Low dose anti-anxiety, anti-depressant, or stimulant medication may be prescribed to address some symptoms of emotional or behavioral disorders associated with ASD. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) ADHD is now in the category of neurodevelopmental disorders in the DSM- 5, indicating that ADHD is related to brain development. Children with ADHD are commonly described as always being on the go, frequently having difficulty paying attention and following directions, and/or being disorganized and forgetful. Children may present symptoms that are predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive, or a combination of both. Some of the symptoms of ADHD include: Inattention Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Lack of attention to detail Difficulty waiting his or her turn Difficulty staying on-task Interrupting or intruding on others Doesn’t appear to be listening even when spoken to directly Difficulty sitting still – fidgets Difficulty with organization Talks excessively Easily distracted Appears “on the go” or “driven by a motor” Symptoms must be present in at least two settings; for example, they could appear in school and in the home. ADHD tends to run in families and can continue into adulthood. Some research suggests that approximately 25% of BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 18 parents of children with ADHD also have the disorder (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry [AACAP], 2013). Children with ADHD may have coexisting conditions. Medications are often prescribed for children with ADHD. The types of medications typically used to treat ADHD include stimulants such as Methylphenidate (Ritalin) or Dextroamphetamine (Adderall), non- stimulants such as Guanfacine (Intuniv), and in some children, antidepressants. However, it is recommended that medication be used in conjunction with other forms of treatments like behavioral therapy or social skills training. Parent education and training as well as early intervention are associated with positive outcomes for children with ADHD [Children and Adults with Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), 2015]. As with other behavioral health issues, some individuals report a reduction of symptoms with proper nutrition, good sleep hygiene, and adequate exercise. Depressive Disorders Depressive Disorders range in severity, including diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). Most everyone experiences feelings of being “down” or sad. However, individuals diagnosed with a depressive disorder have feelings that are persistent and hinder their everyday functioning. In addition to an ongoing sense of sadness, symptoms of depression include: • Low energy and/or fatigue • Feelings of worthlessness • Loss of pleasure; no longer enjoys favorite activities • Trouble with sleep, appetite, weight, concentration • Thoughts of death or suicide The AACAP (2013) suggests that about 5% of children and adolescents experience depression at any given point in time. Children with other behavioral or emotional challenges or who experience loss or high levels of stress are at increased risk for depression. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) is a new diagnosis that has been included in the DSM-5 in the category of Depressive Disorders. A number of clinicians believe that criteria for DMDD more accurately reflect the symptoms of many children previously diagnosed with bipolar and other disorders such as other mood disorders or Oppositional Defiant Disorder. BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 19 It is not unusual for children to be irritable or have occasional temper tantrums. However, children with DMDD exhibit chronic irritability and have severe and frequent outbursts of temper, often with little to no provocation. The child’s mood in between outbursts is mostly irritable or angry. Children diagnosed with DMDD must have symptoms that persist for at least a year. Anxiety Disorders Everyone, including children, feels anxious from time to time. In fact, during certain stages of development, we anticipate that children will experience anxiety. For example, healthy infants and toddlers exhibit signs of anxiety or acute distress when separated from their parents or caregivers. This type of separation anxiety is typical. The characteristics of a clinically significant anxiety disorder include: • Excessive and sometimes uncontrollable worry • Physical symptoms such as stomachaches and headaches • Sleep and/or eating disturbances • Inflexibility • Repetitive, unwanted thoughts When a child experiences these symptoms most days for a period of 6 months or more, she may be diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. When a child exhibits fears that are predominantly related to social situations, she may be diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. Children may also fear something specific such as dogs, heights, or being in closed in spaces to the point that she experiences significant distress; this condition is called Specific Phobia. Children who experience repeated panic attacks – episodes of sudden, intense dread, accompanied by physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, excessive sweating, etc. – may be diagnosed with Panic Disorder. Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders Because many children who receive mental health services have experienced trauma, it is important that service providers understand trauma, recognize responses to trauma, and provide trauma-informed care. It is part of the treatment framework that guides your work as a BHP. Trauma- and Stressor- Related Disorders is a new category in the DSM-5 that includes diagnoses in which stressful or traumatic event(s) appear to be the cause of the individual’s symptoms. We will look more closely at the various trauma-related disorders in Module 10 - Trauma. BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 20 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders is a category of disorders with symptoms of defiant, disruptive, aggressive behaviors ranging in severity. Children and adolescents with one of these types of disorders have difficulty regulating their behavior and emotions and often refuse to follow rules and social norms. They may be viewed by most as simply being “bad.” Behavior such as violating the rights of others, using aggression, lying, stealing, and a lack of empathy may meet the criteria for Conduct Disorder. It is important not to judge and label children with these behaviors as delinquent. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) Challenging authority and testing limits are part of human development. Toddlers exhibit tantrums and refuse to comply as they struggle to become members of their universes. In their quest for autonomy and independence, many adolescents argue with their caregivers and other authority figures. However, children with ODD exhibit behaviors that exceed what is considered age-appropriate. ODD is characterized by a recurring pattern of behavior toward authority figures that includes: • Being easily annoyed, angry, or irritable • Often losing her temper • Arguing frequently • Actively refusing to comply with most requests • Blaming others • Behaving in ways that seem malicious or vindictive Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders The DSM-5 lists over 50 substance-related disorders. Substances include alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, prescription and non-prescription drugs, inhalants, and more. Use of drugs and alcohol can lead to an altered state and impairment of cognitive and behavioral functioning. Sometimes, disorders such as a psychotic disorder or sleep-wake disorder may be substance-induced, meaning the consumption of or withdrawal from a substance seems to be the cause of the individual’s symptoms. Co-occurring disorders is the term used to describe an individual who has a substance-related disorder in addition to another disorder. It is beyond the scope of this curriculum to cover in-depth issues related to substance abuse and addiction. However, it is important for you to be aware of the signs of alcohol or other substance use or abuse and BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 21 bring any concerns that you have to your supervisor and the Treatment Team. Some warning signs include: • Changes in appetite or sleep • Changes in peer group • Increasingly irresponsible behavior • Unusual shifts in mood or attitude • Secretively spending money • Frequent arguments with family and peers Suicide Suicide is not a diagnosis; rather, suicidal thoughts and attempts are a complication of other mental health disorders. Individuals with a history of depression or other mental health issues have an increased risk for suicide. Other risk factors include family history of suicide, alcohol and drug use/abuse, prolonged stress factors such as harassment, bullying, and relationship problems, and exposure to the suicidal behavior of others (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2015). The statistics are staggering. According to a 2015 report by the American Association of Suicidology, suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among young people ages 15 to 24 in the U.S. (Dreapeau & McIntosh, 2015). A 2012 CDC fact sheet reported that, among that same age group, there are approximately 100-200 attempts for every 1 completed suicide (Goldsmith, Pellmar, Kleinman, & Bunney, 2002). A 2013 survey of youth grades 9 – 12 revealed: • 17% reported were seriously considering suicide • 13.6% reported creating a plan • 8% reported attempting suicide in the year prior (Kann, Kinchen, Shanklin, Flint, Hawkins, Harris, & Zaza, 2013) As a Behavioral Health Professional, you need to be aware of the warning signs. Sometimes, the young person may disclose that she is contemplating suicide, telling you that she wants to kill herself, or describing a plan. Other times she may make indirect statements that she feels trapped, just cannot take it anymore, or that life is not worth living. Other warning signs include behavior such as: • Withdrawing / Isolating • Giving away treasured possessions BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 22 • Increased drug or alcohol use • Behaving recklessly • Depressed, anxious, irritable, or erratic moods It is your responsibility to take the young person seriously every time you see signs of suicidal behavior or she makes direct or indirect statements related to suicide. Speaking to the young person in a straight-forward manner about your concerns will not put ideas into her head. When you see signs of suicidal behavior, or if the child makes direct or indirect statements about suicide, be direct. • ASK – ask the young person, “Are you thinking about suicide?” and “Do you have a plan?” • LISTEN – actively listen to what she is saying. Let her talk without interrupting and do not minimize her pain. • TELL – inform her that you need to let someone know what is going on and contact the caregiver(s) and your supervisor (or on-call staff) immediately. If no one is available, call the Maine Crisis Hotline: 1-888- 568-1112 or 911 and stay with the young person. Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) Sometimes a child or adolescent will intentionally inflict injury to her own body, but not with the intent to commit suicide. This act is referred to as nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Behaviors such as carving, cutting, scratching, or burning skin, as well as embedding objects under the skin can be forms of NSSI. According to The Cornell Research Program on Self-Injury and Recovery (2015), “Reasons given for self-injuring are diverse. Many individuals who practice it report overwhelming sadness, anxiety, or emotional numbness as common emotional triggers.” While the intent of this type of self-harm is most often not suicide, self-injurers do have an increased risk of accidental death. You should report any signs of self-injurious behavior to your supervisor immediately. Other Disorders You may encounter numerous other disorders while working in the field of behavioral health. It is beyond the scope of this course to address each of these. As a BHP, you are not expected to be an expert. It takes years of education and experience for clinicians to develop the expertise to accurately diagnose and treat mental health disorders. However, it is important that you ask questions and seek additional training and supervision to become as knowledgeable and skilled as possible. BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 23 Evidence-Based Practices In addition to receiving the in-home or school-based services that you help to deliver, the child and family may participate in other types of treatment with a licensed clinical professional. Psychotherapy, sometimes referred to as “talk therapy,” refers to the various treatment methods that involve the child sharing feelings to address her emotional or behavioral challenges. Other types of treatment use different methodologies to address the child’s symptoms. Below are the Evidence-Based Practices (EBP) for Children in the State of Maine. EBPs are specific treatment approaches that have been tested and shown to be effective in treating some children’s behavioral health disorders. Research in the field of behavioral health is ongoing and the DHHS Office of Child and Family Services is continually examining additional treatment models, known as Promising Practices. As the evidence that supports the effectiveness of these models grows, the treatment models may be included as EBPs. Promising Practices currently being evaluated include, but are not limited to: Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Aggression Replacement Training, Modular Approach to Therapy For Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma or Conduct Problems, Attachment, Regulation and Competency, and more. The child with whom you are working may also participate in some other therapeutic approaches such as: Play therapy, Animal-assisted therapy, or Expressive/Creative Arts therapy.

Treatment Framework Strength-based Trauma-informed Culturally competent Parent & child are the leaders of the team Interventions are tailored to the individual child BHP feedback is very important Clinical expertise guides the treatment Professional boundaries must be maintained Objective observations and accurate documentation are vital Use supervision to support your work The following principles support this framework and serve as a guide for your interactions with the child. Whether you are working with a child with a history of trauma, a neurodevelopmental disorder such as ASD, or a mental health disorder, it is important that you: • Be consistent • Be patient; maintain a calm and positive demeanor • Be encouraging; provide frequent positive feedback • Build on the child’s interests • Create an organized, structured, predictable, yet flexible environment • Give clear and direct instructions • Allow the child adequate time to process what you say • Actively listen • Acknowledge the child’s feelings without reinforcing challenging behavior • Offer choices and avoid power struggles • Build a trusting relationship Building trust in your relationship with the child is key to your effectiveness as a BHP. Psychologist Nicholas Hobbs said, “Trust between child and adult is essential, the foundation on which all other principles rest, the glue that holds teaching and learning together” (Hobbs, 1982). BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 27 What are three things you can do to build a trusting relationship with the child with whom you are working? 1. _________________________________________________________________________ 2. _________________________________________________________________________ 3. _________________________________________________________________________ Remember, each child’s Individualized Treatment Plan describes the child’s goals and objectives, the methods and strategies that you are to implement, and how progress is to be measured. Seek clarification from your supervisor and the Treatment Team whenever you are unclear about how to implement a treatment strategy. Medication Medication can be an effective part of the child’s treatment, but it is only one part of the total treatment plan. Medication alone is rarely the complete solution. A common saying among some professionals is, “pills don’t build skills.” The role of medication is to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with the diagnosis. Other treatment strategies may then be more effective in addressing the child’s functioning. Controversy exists over the safety and effectiveness of psychiatric medications, particularly in children. Parents or caregivers may have concerns about their child taking medications. Some caregivers prefer trying other approaches such as modifying their child’s diet, using nutritional supplements, or employing other approaches such as homeopathy or chiropractic care. Caregivers may mistrust the medical model or feel a sense of failure or even denial about their child’s diagnosis. Conversely, some caregivers may accept a recommendation for medication(s) without question, or they may feel apprehensive about questioning a doctor’s orders. Deciding to use medication to treat a child with a mental health disorder is complex. As a BHP, you may have your own ideas and opinions about medication. You may have had a positive or negative experience with prescription medications. Or you may have heard conflicting information. It is important that you refrain from sharing your opinions with the child and family. Do not attempt to influence their decision about medication. What should you do if a caregiver shares his or her concerns with you or solicits your opinion? Actively listen and encourage them to talk with the Treatment Team. Urge caregivers to seek the advice of a licensed professional or prescribing physician and gather as much information as they can about the potential risks and benefits. BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 28 In determining when to prescribe medications, licensed medical professionals are trained to begin by taking a comprehensive history of the child and her symptoms through multiple sources. It is not enough to know that the child is experiencing symptoms or distress. Clinicians consider the Bio-Psycho-Social factors to understand the clinical story of the individual. Other considerations for prescribing medication include: 1. Is the particular medication indicated to treat the child’s diagnosis? Is it approved for children? 2. What are the potential side effects? 3. What are the risks and the benefits? 4. Is this individual likely to take the medication as prescribed? 5. Is there potential for abuse/addiction? Maine’s DHHS requires that any unlicensed worker must be a Certified Residential Medication Aide (CRMA) in order to administer medication. As a BHP, you are not permitted to pass medications without being a CRMA. It is your responsibility to know your agency’s medication administration policy and adhere to the licensing rules set by DHHS. If you know that the child with whom you are working is currently taking medication as part of her treatment, you should be familiar with the following: 1. The symptoms that the medication is intended to treat. 2. The possible side effects. 3. The specific interactions, such as foods that should not be consumed or other medications that should not be taken along with the medication. For example, should the child avoid sun exposure due to photosensitivity from the medication? 4. The signs of overdose. General signs of overdose include:  Increased severity of known side effects  Nausea and vomiting  Extreme drowsiness  Loss of consciousness If you see any of these signs of overdose, call 911 immediately and notify the parents or caregivers. The various groups of medications, the disorders they are typically prescribed to treat, and the possible side effects are outlined in the tables on pages 208-212. (Some of the medications listed may not be approved for use in children.) BHP Module 8 – Children’s Behavioral Health 29 Conclusion Diagnosis and treatment of children’s behavioral health needs are complex. As a BHP, you should have a general understanding of the disorder or disorders of the child with whom you work. You must also have a clear understanding of the child’s Individualized Treatment Plan: the child’s goals and objectives, the methods and strategies that you are expected to implement, and how progress is to be measured. Approaching each child as an individual who has unique challenges and strengths will increase your effectiveness in furthering the goals of the child and family.
