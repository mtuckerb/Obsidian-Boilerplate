Those disparities can be magnified when disability intersects with other marginalized sociodemographic characteristics. This chapter briefly summarizes some of the inequities experienced by people with disabilities, broadly speaking. It then presents evidence of even greater inequities among people with disabilities in historically minority racial and ethnic groups, women with disabilities, sexual and gender diverse individuals with disabilities, and people with disabilities living in rural areas. The chapter closes with a discussion of the need for targeted efforts to address inequities at these inter- sections and promote health across the full diversity of the disability population. 4.2 Key Concepts 4.2.1 Inequality, Inequity, and Disparity The words inequality, inequity, and disparity are easily confused. The term health disparity is primarily used in the United States, while other countries more com- monly use the terms health inequality and health inequity (Carter-Pokras & Baquet, 2002). Inequality simply describes differences between groups. Such differences W. Horner-Johnson (*) Institute on Development and Disability, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA OHSU-PSU School of Public Health, Portland, OR, USA e-mail: hornerjo@ohsu.edu 92 could occur for any number of reasons; the existence of inequality does not neces- sarily indicate a need for intervention. In contrast, inequity refers specifically to a difference that is unjust or unfair. Thus, the term inequity carries an ethical judge- ment regarding the cause of the difference (Carter-Pokras & Baquet, 2002). The interpretation of the word disparity has shifted somewhat over time. Disparity has often been defined as a synonym of inequality: a difference without a value judg- ment. However, in recent decades and especially in public health contexts, the con- cepts of injustice and lack of fairness have been attached to the term disparity (Carter-Pokras & Baquet, 2002). Healthy People 2020 defined health disparities specifically as differences linked to economic, social, or environmental disadvan- tage. Based on this definition, Braveman (2014, p.7) asserted that “health disparities are inequitable, even when we do not know the causes, because they put an already economically/socially disadvantaged group at further disadvantage with respect to their health.” Distinctions between inequality and inequity also apply to decisions about how to distribute resources. Should public health resources be distributed evenly to all (equality), or should more resources be allocated to those with greater need (equity)? If we are to reduce disparities between population groups, then groups that have historically been disadvantaged should receive more intensive and targeted public health resources to help overcome the disproportionate burden of poor health expe- rienced by these groups. Similarly, different population groups have different levels of need for healthcare resources. People with disabilities often need more frequent and more specialized care than is the case for people without disabilities. Equitable distribution of healthcare resources would recognize those greater needs and pro- vide care according to need. Distinguishing between equal and equitable access to health care is important when analyzing public health data. For example, if we sim- ply look at receipt of a minimum basic level of health care, people with disabilities appear to be faring well: 71% of adults with disabilities have had a routine checkup in the past year compared to 68% of adults without disabilities (CDC, 2019). However, adults with disabilities are more than twice as likely as adults without dis- abilities to have unmet healthcare needs due to cost (26% versus 10%). Clearly, people with disabilities need more health care than they are able to obtain. The inability to afford that care is in indicator of inequity. 4.2.2 Disability Versus Poor Health In the public health field, disability is commonly seen as a health problem that pub- lic health interventions are intended to prevent. In essence, disability is assumed to be equivalent to poor health. From this perspective, poor health among people with disabilities is simply to be expected rather than being considered inequitable. Conversely, researchers and practitioners who focus on the health of people with disabilities perceive disability and health as separate concepts. The latter view, which is the one underlying this book, acknowledges that people can both have a W. Horner-Johnson93 disability and be healthy. In fact, a consistent finding in national surveys is that more than half of adults with disabilities describe their health as excellent, very good, or good (CDC, 2019; Wolf, Armour, & Campbell, 2008). While that is sub- stantially lower than the proportion of people without disabilities who describe their health in such terms, it does indicate that it is entirely possible to have a disability and enjoy positive health. The challenge for public health is to ensure that people with disabilities have equitable access to the means and opportunities for living healthy lives. 4.3 Health Inequities Experienced by People with Disabilities There is ample evidence of health differences between people with and without dis- abilities. What has proven more difficult is convincing public health professionals and agencies that at least some of these differences represent inequities rather than being an inherent component of the disability experience (Krahn, Klein Walker, & Correa-De-Araujo, 2015). Indeed, there are some conditions for which people with disabilities are at greater risk specifically because of their underlying disabilities; these are called secondary conditions (Turk, 2006). Examples include urinary tract infections and pressure ulcers among people with spinal cord injuries and aspiration pneumonia among people with cerebral palsy. We expect such conditions to be more common among people with disabilities than among people without disabili- ties, because they typically would not exist in the absence of the primary disability (Turk, 2006). Thus, differences between people with and without disabilities in the occurrence of these conditions are not necessarily unfair. At the same time—because there are certain known risks for people with certain types of disabling conditions— we expect medical care for people with those primary disabling conditions to be more intensely directed toward preventing secondary conditions to the maximum extent possible and providing early treatment of those that occur (Turk, 2006). Within the population of people with disabilities, some groups receive less preven- tive medical care than others, have insurance plans that more aggressively limit coverage for preventive items such as durable medical equipment and sufficient catheter supplies, and have fewer resources available to help advocate for their health needs. These differences are linked to uneven access to social determinants of health and may result in inequitable distribution of secondary conditions among people with disabilities. Importantly, it is not only secondary conditions that are more common among people with disabilities than among people without disabilities. Many chronic con- ditions that affect people both with and without disabilities are markedly more prev- alent among people with disabilities. For example, age-adjusted analyses of data from the US adult population indicate that people with disabilities are significantly more likely to have cancer (8.8% vs. 5.1%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13.7% vs. 3.0%), hypertension (41.9% vs. 25.9%), obesity (39.5% vs. 26.3%), and diabetes (16.2% vs. 7.1%) than their counterparts without disabilities (CDC, 2019). 4 Disability, Intersectionality, and Inequity: Life at the Margins94 If we accept Braveman’s (2014) premise that health differences between socially advantaged and socially disadvantaged groups are inherently inequitable, then the differences between people with and without disabilities should be seen as evidence of inequity. People with disabilities are demonstrably disadvantaged in our society. For much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many people with disabilities were excluded from society entirely and isolated in institutions. It was not until 1974 that legislation was passed to guarantee a free and appropriate public educa- tion to children with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act—the first comprehensive legislation prohibiting discrimination against people with disabili- ties—was signed in 1990. As noted in the chapter on Social Determinants of Health (Chap. 3), people with disabilities are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as people without disabilities. For any other population group, the presence of such disadvantages would lead to the conclusion that health differences between the disadvantaged group and those with more economic and social advantages are inequitable, regardless of whether or not we can determine the precise cause of the health differences (Braveman, 2014). Conversely, the same conclusion has not con- sistently been applied to people with disabilities because disability and poor health are commonly viewed as inextricably (i.e., biologically) linked (Krahn et al., 2015). When discussing chronic conditions among people with disabilities, a question often arises as to which is the chicken and which is the egg (Krahn et al., 2015). Because much of the data we rely on are cross-sectional in nature, we cannot always be certain whether disability preceded the onset of chronic conditions or emerged from them. In some cases, disability does result from chronic health conditions. For instance, if diabetes is not controlled, it can lead to blindness and limb loss. However, there is also evidence that people with preexisting disabilities are at greater risk of developing chronic conditions, compared to people without disabilities. A study using data from the National Health Interview Survey found that people with life- long disabilities were substantially more likely than people with no disabilities to have heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension (Dixon-Ibarra & Horner-Johnson, 2014). The study focused specifically on people whose disabilities were diagnosed by the age of 6 years, and it excluded people who reported lifelong conditions similar to the health problems studied (e.g., heart conditions, cancer, diabetes). Therefore, it is highly likely that the health problems developed after the onset of disability and were not directly related to the disability. In other words, they were comorbid conditions that could potentially be prevented if people with dis- abilities had equitable access to health promotion opportunities and other social determinants of health. The high prevalence of poverty among people with disabilities results in substan- tially curtailed access to opportunities to engage in behavioral determinants of posi- tive health, such as healthy eating and exercise. The reduction in opportunities for healthy living associated with low-socioeconomic status may be magnified by atti- tudes and environments that are not welcoming to people with disabilities. For example, as outlined in the Environmental Contexts chapter (Chap. 5) of this vol- ume, people with disabilities often encounter physical barriers to community-based health venues. Few fitness centers offer adapted exercise equipment such as hand W. Horner-Johnson95 cycles. Health promotion classes and other events are sometimes held in locations that do not meet accessibility requirements as specified by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Health promotion materials further exclude people with disabilities if the materials are not available in formats that can be read and understood by people with sensory or cognitive disabilities. Moreover, health promotion materials rarely include images of people with disabilities, resulting in a more subtle form of exclusion by creating the impression that such materials are not applicable to indi- viduals with disabilities. While inequitable access to opportunities to live a healthy lifestyle places people with disabilities at risk for chronic conditions, disparities are further exacerbated by inequitable access to and receipt of health care. People with disabilities face a bar- rage of negative attitudes, structural barriers, and communication problems in healthcare settings. For example, people with physical disabilities often encounter narrow doorways, restricted maneuvering space, and a lack of accessible medical equipment (e.g., wheelchair accessible scales and adjustable height exam tables). People with intellectual disabilities may have particular difficulty understanding complex medical language and instructions. People who are deaf or hard of hearing frequently face challenges with obtaining appropriate and timely sign language interpreter services. People who are blind or have low vision may have difficulty navigating to and within clinics and obtaining information in accessible formats such as large print or screen-readable electronic documents. These barriers contrib- ute to disparities in prevention, diagnosis, and management of chronic conditions and life-threatening diseases. For example,  numerous studies have found that women with disabilities are less likely than those without disabilities to receive breast and cervical cancer screening as often as recommended (e.g., Armour, Thierry, & Wolf, 2009; Steele, Townsend, Courtney-Long, & Young, 2017). Delays in screening can result in delays in diagnosis and treatment, which increase the likelihood that women with disabilities will die of cancer. In fact, research has found that women with disabilities tend to have their cancers diagnosed at later stages, receive less aggressive cancer treatment, and have higher cancer mortality than women without disabilities (Iezzoni et al., 2008; McCarthy et al., 2006; Roetzheim & Chirikos, 2002). The many barriers and stressors people with disabilities face likely contribute to observed disparities in mental health. Depression is highly prevalent, with 43.3% of adults with disabilities reporting depression versus 12.1% of adults without disabili- ties (CDC, 2019). Moreover, adults with disabilities are significantly and substan- tially less likely to receive adequate social and emotional support than is the case for adults without disabilities (Krahn et  al., 2015). People with disabilities are also disproportionately affected by health risks that are even more clearly socially medi- ated: individuals with disabilities are 2.5 more likely than people without disabili- ties to be victims of violent crime (Harrell, 2017). People with disabilities are at especially high risk of sexual assault and intimate partner violence (Breiding & Armour, 2015; CDC, 2008; Harrell, 2017). It is difficult to see how such differences could be interpreted as anything other than inequities. Disability does not cause the 4 Disability, Intersectionality, and Inequity: Life at the Margins96 health threats associated with experiences of violence; rather, those threats emerge directly from the way people with disabilities are treated by others. 4.4 Intersections of Disability with Other Marginalized Identities: Compounded Inequities Although health inequities are widespread in the disability population as a whole, some subsets of the population are especially vulnerable. Further, while disability cuts across all population groups, some groups are more affected than others. Disability is more common in certain historically minority racial and ethnic groups, in rural areas, among women, and among people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisex- ual, transgender, nonbinary, queer, and/or other gender identity (LGBTQ+), as will be detailed below. There are well-established literatures on the significant health disparities and inequities experienced by each of these other populations. When individuals in these population groups also experience disability, the inequities may be compounded. Below are some examples of evidence indicating greater inequity for people living at these intersections. 4.4.1 Race and Ethnicity In estimates adjusted for age differences between racial and ethnic groups, disabil- ity prevalence is significantly higher among American Indians and Alaska Natives (41% with a disability), multiracial adults (34%), Blacks (29%), and Hispanics (29%) than it is among non-Hispanic White adults (24%) (CDC, 2019). Racial and ethnic minorities have been described as doubly burdened by inequities associated with both their disability status and their race or ethnicity (ACMH, 2011). They experience the many covert and overt forms of bias and discrimination associated with each of these characteristics (Yee et al., 2018). As such, their health is often worse than that of non-Hispanic Whites with disabilities, as well as members of their own racial or ethnic groups who do not have disabilities. Adults with disabilities in historically minority racial and ethnic groups are more likely to report fair/poor health, and that their health has worsened in the past year, compared to people without disabilities in the same racial/ethnic groups and com- pared to non-Hispanic Whites with disabilities (Gulley, Rasch, & Chan, 2014; Jones & Sinclair, 2008; Magaña, Parish, Morales, Li, & Fujiura, 2016; Wolf et al., 2008). Minorities with disabilities also have substantially less access to social determinants of health. For example, 21% to 34% of American Indian or Alaska Native, Black, multiracial, and Hispanic adults with disabilities live below the federal poverty level, compared with 14% of non-Hispanic Whites with disabilities and 6% of non- Hispanic Whites without disabilities (Horner-Johnson & Dobbertin, 2013). W. Horner-Johnson97 Income disparities often contribute directly to unmet healthcare needs. Blacks and Hispanics with disabilities are significantly more likely to say there was a time in the past year when they needed to see a doctor but could not due to cost (27% and 31%, respectively) compared to non-Hispanic Whites with disabilities (24%) (CDC, 2019). In a study using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, working- age adults with disabilities who were American Indian or Alaska Native, Black, or multiracial had significantly elevated odds of having less than one dental checkup per year (odds ratios of 2.51, 2.99, and 2.43, respectively), compared to the refer- ence group of non-Hispanic Whites without disabilities (Horner-Johnson, Dobbertin, & Beilstein-Wedel, 2015). Furthermore, odds ratios for these groups were signifi- cantly higher than those for people without disabilities in the same racial groups and for non-Hispanic Whites with disabilities (Horner-Johnson, Dobbertin, & Beilstein- Wedel, 2015). Significant differences remained but were markedly attenuated when taking poverty and presence of dental insurance into account (Horner-Johnson, Dobbertin, & Beilstein-Wedel, 2015). Similar patterns have been found specifically among adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). An analysis of National Core Indicators data for adults with IDD showed that Blacks had signifi- cantly lower odds of visiting a dentist in the past year (OR = 0.60) or receiving a flu vaccine in the past year (OR = 0.68) compared to non-Hispanic White adults with IDD (Bershadsky, Hiersteiner, Fay, & Bradley, 2014). As noted earlier, a substantial body of research has documented lower rates of breast and cervical cancer screening among women with disabilities overall com- pared to women without disabilities. A few studies have delved further and exam- ined racial and ethnic differences in screening among women with disabilities. In reviewing medical records of women with IDD, Parish and colleagues found that 51% of eligible Black women had received a mammogram during a 2-year period compared to 76% of White women (Parish, Swaine, Son, & Luken, 2013). A study of deaf women found that 44% of Black or Hispanic women in the sample had received a mammogram in the past 2  years versus 70% of non-Hispanic White women (Berman, Jo, Cumberland, et al., 2013). The proportion of each racial/ethnic group that had received a mammogram in the deaf sample was also substantially lower than proportions reported for the same racial/ethnic groups in the general population, supporting the premise that there are compounded disparities for women who are both deaf and members of a disadvantaged racial or ethnic group (Berman et al., 2013). Chronic health conditions and health risk factors are also unevenly distributed by race and ethnicity within the disability population. National-level data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (CDC, 2019) provide several examples: • Blacks and Hispanics with disabilities are less likely to engage in aerobic physi- cal activity (35% of each group do so, versus 41% of non-Hispanic Whites with disabilities). • Nearly 46% of Blacks with disabilities are obese, compared to 39% of non- Hispanic Whites with disabilities. 4 Disability, Intersectionality, and Inequity: Life at the Margins98 • High blood pressure is significantly more prevalent among Blacks with disabili- ties than among non-Hispanic Whites with disabilities (52% vs. 41%), • Diabetes is significantly more common among Blacks, Hispanics, and other/ multiracial groups than among non-Hispanic Whites with disabilities (21%, 20%, and 20%, respectively, vs. 14%). The fact that such racial and ethnic variations are apparent within the population of adults with disabilities suggests that these conditions are not part and parcel of the disability experience. Rather, they are potentially avoidable health problems that inequitably impact members of oppressed racial and ethnic groups in a way that mirrors disparities in income, access to health care, and other social determinants of health. 4.4.2 Gender Women in the United States live longer than men and thus have more opportunity to experience disability. Yet, even in age-adjusted analyses, women are significantly more likely than men to have one or more disabilities (27% versus 24%) (CDC, 2019). Women with disabilities have historically had limited participation in the workforce and low income, compared both to women without disabilities and to men with disabilities. In one of the first studies to focus specifically on women with disabilities, Hanna and Rogovsky (1991) found that the employment and income differences between women with disabilities and men without disabilities were greater than what would result if the disparities associated with gender alone and disability alone were simply added together. The authors noted that there appeared to be a “plus factor” specific to the combination of being a woman and having a dis- ability that resulted in exacerbated disparities. More recently, Parish, Rose, and Andrews (2009) found that US women with disabilities were more than twice as likely to be living in poverty as women without disabilities. Moreover, even among women with incomes above the federal poverty level, women with disabilities were significantly more likely than women without disabilities to experience other indicators of material hardship, including food inse- curity and difficulty making rent payments (Parish et al., 2009). Inadequate nutri- tion and housing – and worries about being able to afford such basic necessities as food and shelter—leave women with disabilities disproportionately vulnerable to chronic physical and mental health conditions. Women with disabilities continue to be disadvantaged relative to women without disabilities and to men with disabilities. In 2018 women with disabilities who were employed full-time earned an average of 80 cents for each dollar earned by men with disabilities (National Women’s Law Center, 2019). Further, women with dis- abilities are significantly more likely than men with disabilities to say there was a time in the past 12 months when they needed to see a doctor but could not due to W. Horner-Johnson99 cost (28.2% vs. 23.5%) (CDC, 2019). Compared to men with disabilities, women with disabilities also are significantly more likely to (CDC, 2019): • Be obese (42% vs. 36%). • Have asthma (21% vs. 12%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15% vs. 12%), cancer (11% vs. 7%), or arthritis (46% vs. 35%). • Have had at least 1 day in the past 30 days when their physical health was not good (64% vs. 55%). • Have had at least 1 day in the past 30 days when their mental health was not good (63% vs. 52%). • Experience depression (50% vs. 35%). Given these differences, perhaps it is not surprising that women with disabilities are significantly more likely than men with disabilities to describe their general health as fair or poor (43% versus 39%) (CDC, 2019). 4.4.3 Sexual Orientation Several studies have described an overlap between disability and sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Disability prevalence is higher among lesbian, gay, or bisex- ual (LGB) adults than among heterosexual adults (Fredriksen, Kim, & Barkan, 2012). Youth with disabilities are more likely than those without disabilities to report same-sex or both-sex attraction or identify as LGB (Blum, Kelly, & Ireland, 2001; Cheng & Udry, 2002; Cheng & Udry, 2005; Higgins Tejera, Horner-Johnson, & Andresen, 2019; Kahn & Halpern, 2018). People with disabilities, particularly those who are autistic, are also more likely than people without disabilities to be gender nonconforming (George & Stokes, 2018). Despite this overlap, few analyses have examined the health of people with dis- abilities who have a minority sexual orientation (LGB) and/or gender identity (e.g., transgender, nonbinary, or genderqueer [TQ+]). A national survey of adults with disabilities found that LGBTQ+ respondents were significantly more likely than non-LGBTQ+ respondents to report fair or poor health and have unmet healthcare needs (Hall, Batza, & Kurth, 2019). Further, those who identified as LGBTQ+ were more than twice as likely as non-LGBT+ respondents to say that a healthcare pro- vider had refused to provide services to them (Hall et al., 2019). LGBTQ+ adults also were significantly more likely to report social isolation (28% versus 17%) (Hall et al., 2019). The stigma and social isolation experienced by individuals experienc- ing both disability and a minority sexual identity can have profound health conse- quences. In a survey of high school students in Oregon, more than half of LGB teens with disabilities (56%) said they had seriously considered suicide during the past 12 months, compared to 27% of LGB teens without disabilities, 28% of heterosex- ual teens with disabilities, and 9% of heterosexual teens without disabilities (Higgins Tejera et al., 2019). 4 Disability, Intersectionality, and Inequity: Life at the Margins100 4.4.4 Rurality Across the USA, 17.7% percent of people ages 5 and up living in noncore counties (those with an urban core population of less than 10,000) have a disability, com- pared to 11.7% of the population in metropolitan areas (Myers, Greiman, von Reichert, & Seekins, 2016). The difference in disability prevalence is not simply due to the higher average age of rural residents; in every age group, disability is more common in rural areas than it is in metropolitan areas (Myers et al., 2016). Complexity of disability also appears to vary with rurality. Among adults ages 18 and older, those living in the most rural areas are significantly more likely than those in metropolitan areas to have three or more disabilities (Zhao, Okoro, Hsia, Garvin, & Town, 2019). People with disabilities living in rural areas experience disparities in socioeco- nomic determinants of health that are even greater than those experienced by people with disabilities in metropolitan areas (Myers et  al., 2016). Rural residents with disabilities also appear to be more vulnerable to the long-term effects of economic downturns. While overall employment rates for people with disabilities in the USA increased slightly in the first several years after the 2008–2011 recession, employ- ment of people with disabilities in rural areas decreased (RTC: Rural, 2019a). These socioeconomic disparities may exacerbate the effects of geographic isolation, leav- ing people with disabilities in rural areas at high risk for poor outcomes. People with disabilities living in rural areas face substantial barriers to obtaining needed health care. Barriers include long travel distances to healthcare facilities, lack of transportation, limited availability of specialized care and knowledgeable care providers, clinic sites that are not sufficiently accessible to people with disabili- ties, and difficulty affording co-payments and medications (Davidsson & Södergård, 2016; Iezzoni, Killeen, & O’Day, 2006; Walker, Alfonso, Colquitt, Weeks, & Telfair, 2016). These barriers are likely contributors to the disparities that have been observed in receipt of preventive cancer screenings for adults with disabilities in rural areas compared to their urban counterparts (Horner-Johnson, Dobbertin, & Iezzoni, 2015; Horner-Johnson, Dobbertin, Lee, & Andresen, 2014). In short, peo- ple with disabilities in rural areas are more likely to be living in circumstances that contribute to poor health and less likely to be able to obtain the care and services needed to prevent or treat poor health. 4.5 Addressing Compounded Inequities In order to address inequities, we must first be aware that they exist. Thus, data col- lection and analysis plays a key role. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010, not only recognized people with disabilities as a health disparity population, it also mandated collection of data on disability status to ensure that disability-related health disparities will be measured and monitored. W. Horner-Johnson101 That mandate has spurred the addition of a set of six disability questions to population- based health surveys, as detailed in the chapters on Epidemiology (Chap. 2) and Global Disability (Chap. 7). Consistent and ongoing data collection will help clarify the nature and extent of the health problems experienced by people with dis- abilities compared to those with no disabilities. However, it is also important to analyze those data in combination with information about other sociodemographic characteristics in order to better understand how disability interacts with other mar- ginalized identities. Analyzing data from smaller subgroups of people with disabili- ties often will require pooling multiple years of data. Thus, data collection systems should continue to use consistent measures and methods from year to year, to the maximum extent possible (Yee et  al., 2018). Reports generated from these data should include comparisons between people with and without disabilities and address how disparities may differ as disability intersects with other characteristics such as race and ethnicity (Yee et al., 2018). Such analyses will enable public health professionals to identify population subgroups most impacted by specific disparities and will inform efforts to address inequities experienced by the most vulnerable members of the disability population. Ongoing data collection and analysis also will contribute to evaluation and improvement of targeted intervention efforts. As disparities continue to be identified, public health professionals have a responsibility to develop programs and policies to address these disparities. Federal policy changes already have resulted in substantial improvements in health equity. For example, many more Americans with disabilities now have health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act (Kennedy, Wood, & Frieden, 2017). In Medicaid expansion states, gains in insurance coverage have been particularly strong for peo- ple with disabilities living in rural areas (RTC: Rural, 2019b), reducing one barrier to equitable health care. While these gains are impressive, there remains a consider- able need to develop additional policies and programs and advocate for the societal and institutional changes needed to support health equity. A key issue is that some  federal funding agencies do not yet recognize people with disabilities as a population that experiences disparities. Nor are people with disabilities or sub- groups of people with disabilities designated as Medically Underserved Populations (MUPs). Addressing these gaps would facilitate more extensive research on health disparities within disability populations. Moreover, MUP designation would allow health professionals interested in providing care to people with disabilities to qual- ify for federal loan repayment programs, which would help increase the number of professionals qualified to provide care to people with disabilities (ACMH, 2011). Incentives are also needed to encourage providers of specialty care needed by peo- ple with disabilities to serve in rural areas and communities of color. Other policy initiatives could include increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates. Some doctors are reluctant to accept patients on Medicaid, which is a challenge for people with disabilities in general, and especially so for racial and ethnic minorities and rural residents with disabilities who disproportionately rely on Medicaid coverage (Gulley et al., 2014; RTC: Rural, 2019b). Policies and programs are also needed at state, local, and organizational levels to ensure inclusion of diverse people with dis- abilities in health equity efforts. 4 Disability, Intersectionality, and Inequity: Life at the Margins102 Another crucial component of addressing inequities is assuring that health pro- fessionals are equipped to address the needs of diverse people with disabilities. A well-trained and culturally competent workforce is essential for providing inclusive health promotion and high-quality health care. Achieving health equity requires competency in meeting the needs of all population demographic groups, including those with disabilities. In a 2011 report, the Advisory Committee on Minority Health (ACMH) highlighted the lack of professional training and disability compe- tence among healthcare providers as among the “most significant and fundamental barriers preventing people with disabilities from receiving quality health care” (ACMH, 2011, p.  10). Limited disability competency can result in poor patient- provider communication, inappropriate diagnoses and treatment, and distrust of providers (ACMH, 2011). Moreover, it is important to consider cultural differences within the disability population and understand that beliefs, values, and practices may vary among subgroups of people with disabilities (ACMH, 2011). The chapter on Preparing a Disability Competnent Workforce (Chap. 16) in this volume presents disability competencies and strategies to guide training. Competencies include accommodating and addressing the specific needs of indi- viduals with disabilities, but also understanding the many ways in which people with and without disabilities are alike. The competency frameworks emphasize the need to recognize disability as a demographic characteristic similar to and intersect- ing with age, gender, sexual identity, race, ethnicity, and language. Now that these competencies have been developed, the next crucial step is for entities such as the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Liaison Committee on Medical Education to mandate that these competencies be adopted as core curriculum com- ponents and licensing requirements, as was recommended by the ACMH several years ago (ACMH, 2011). The ACMH further recommended that demonstration of disability competency be required for accreditation and receipt of federal funding by healthcare training institutions and hospitals (ACMH, 2011). Such a requirement would provide a strong financial incentive for improving disability competency and advancing health equity. In addition to promoting inclusion of disability in health equity efforts, we must ensure attention to equity in disability programs, services, and research. Too often, disability and diversity are seen as separate issues to be addressed in separate silos (Goode, Carter-Pokras, Horner-Johnson, & Yee, 2014). Yet disability is present in all sociodemographic categories and in all spheres of life. We cannot logically talk about population health or health equity without addressing the health of people with disabilities. Likewise, we cannot effectively address the health of people with disabilities without attention to the diversity of the disability population and the range of sociocultural factors that influence the health of this heterogeneous, cross- cutting demographic. As stated in a recent report commissioned by the National Academies of Science: “Disability is only one of multiple cultural identities. It is essential to recognize and respond to the myriad within group differences among people with disabilities and their lived experience” (Yee et al., 2018, p. 60). W. Horner-Johnson103 4.6 Discussion Questions 1. Define the terms health inequality, health inequity, and health disparity. Describe some of the different ways the term disparity has been defined. 2.
